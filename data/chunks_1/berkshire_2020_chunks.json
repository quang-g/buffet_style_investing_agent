    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire earned $42.5 billion in 2020 according to generally accepted accounting principles (commonly\ncalled “GAAP”). The four components of that figure are $21.9 billion of operating earnings, $4.9 billion of realized\ncapital gains, a $26.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold and, finally, an $11 billion loss from a write-down in the value of a few subsidiary and affiliate businesses\nthat we own. All items are stated on an after-tax basis.\nOperating earnings are what count most, even during periods when they are not the largest item in our GAAP\ntotal. Our focus at Berkshire is both to increase this segment of our income and to acquire large and favorably-situated\nbusinesses. Last year, however, we met neither goal: Berkshire made no sizable acquisitions and operating earnings\nfell 9%. We did, though, increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by both retaining earnings and repurchasing\nabout 5% of our shares.\nThe two GAAP components pertaining to capital gains or losses (whether realized or unrealized) fluctuate\ncapriciously from year to year, reflecting swings in the stock market. Whatever today’s figures, Charlie Munger, my\nlong-time partner, and I firmly believe that, over time, Berkshire’s capital gains from its investment holdings will be\nsubstantial.\nAs I’ve emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire’s holdings of marketable stocks – at yearend\nworth $281 billion – as a collection of businesses. We don’t control the operations of those companies, but we do\nshare proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of their\nearnings is not included in Berkshire’s income. Instead, only what these investees pay us in dividends is recorded on\nour books. Under GAAP, the huge sums that investees retain on our behalf become invisible.\nWhat’s out of sight, however, should not be out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually\nbuilding value – lots of value – for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, make\nacquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings).\nAs we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout our\ncountry’s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions of\nshareholders as well.\nOf course, some of our investees will disappoint, adding little, if anything, to the value of their company by\nretaining earnings. But others will over-deliver, a few spectacularly. In aggregate, we expect our share of the huge\npile of earnings retained by Berkshire’s non-controlled businesses (what others would label our equity portfolio) to\neventually deliver us an equal or greater amount of capital gains. Over our 56-year tenure, that expectation has been\nmet.\n\nThe final component in our GAAP figure – that ugly $11 billion write-down – is almost entirely the\nquantification of a mistake I made in 2016. That year, Berkshire purchased Precision Castparts (“PCC”), and I paid\ntoo much for the company.\nNo one misled me in any way – I was simply too optimistic about PCC’s normalized profit potential. Last\nyear, my miscalculation was laid bare by adverse developments throughout the aerospace industry, PCC’s most\nimportant source of customers.\nIn purchasing PCC, Berkshire bought a fine company – the best in its business. Mark Donegan, PCC’s CEO,\nis a passionate manager who consistently pours the same energy into the business that he did before we purchased it.\nWe are lucky to have him running things.\nI believe I was right in concluding that PCC would, over time, earn good returns on the net tangible assets\ndeployed in its operations. I was wrong, however, in judging the average amount of future earnings and, consequently,\nwrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business.\nPCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it’s a big one.",

    "content": "Two Strings to Our Bow\nBerkshire is often labeled a conglomerate, a negative term applied to holding companies that own a\nhodge-podge of unrelated businesses. And, yes, that describes Berkshire – but only in part. To understand how and\nwhy we differ from the prototype conglomerate, let’s review a little history.\nOver time, conglomerates have generally limited themselves to buying businesses in their entirety. That\nstrategy, however, came with two major problems. One was unsolvable: Most of the truly great businesses had no\ninterest in having anyone take them over. Consequently, deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-so\ncompanies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. That was not a great pond in which to fish.\nBeyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often found\nthemselves required to pay staggering “control” premiums to snare their quarry. Aspiring conglomerateurs knew the\nanswer to this “overpayment” problem: They simply needed to manufacture a vastly overvalued stock of their own\nthat could be used as a “currency” for pricey acquisitions. (“I’ll pay you $10,000 for your dog by giving you two of\nmy $5,000 cats.”)\nOften, the tools for fostering the overvaluation of a conglomerate’s stock involved promotional techniques\nand “imaginative” accounting maneuvers that were, at best, deceptive and that sometimes crossed the line into fraud.\nWhen these tricks were “successful,” the conglomerate pushed its own stock to, say, 3 x its business value in order to\noffer the target 2 x its value.\nInvesting illusions can continue for a surprisingly long time. Wall Street loves the fees that deal-making\ngenerates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide. At a point, also, the soaring price of a\npromoted stock can itself become the “proof” that an illusion is reality.\n\nEventually, of course, the party ends, and many business “emperors” are found to have no clothes. Financial\nhistory is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses by\njournalists, analysts and investment bankers, but whose creations ended up as business junkyards.\nConglomerates earned their terrible reputation.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I want our conglomerate to own all or part of a diverse group of businesses with good economic\ncharacteristics and good managers. Whether Berkshire controls these businesses, however, is unimportant to us.\nIt took me a while to wise up. But Charlie – and also my 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inherited\nat Berkshire – finally convinced me that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable,\nmore enjoyable and far less work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise.\nFor those reasons, our conglomerate will remain a collection of controlled and non-controlled businesses.\nCharlie and I will simply deploy your capital into whatever we believe makes the most sense, based on a company’s\ndurable competitive strengths, the capabilities and character of its management, and price.\nIf that strategy requires little or no effort on our part, so much the better. In contrast to the scoring system\nutilized in diving competitions, you are awarded no points in business endeavors for “degree of difficulty.”\nFurthermore, as Ronald Reagan cautioned: “It’s said that hard work never killed anyone, but I say why take the\nchance?”",

    "content": "The Family Jewels and How We Increase Your Share of These Gems\nOn page A-1 we list Berkshire’s subsidiaries, a smorgasbord of businesses employing 360,000 at yearend.\nYou can read much more about these controlled operations in the 10-K that fills the back part of this report. Our major\npositions in companies that we partly own and don’t control are listed on page 7 of this letter. That portfolio of\nbusinesses, too, is large and diverse.\nMost of Berkshire’s value, however, resides in four businesses, three controlled and one in which we have\nonly a 5.4% interest. All four are jewels.\nThe largest in value is our property/casualty insurance operation, which for 53 years has been the core of\nBerkshire. Our family of insurers is unique in the insurance field. So, too, is its manager, Ajit Jain, who joined\nBerkshire in 1986.\nOverall, the insurance fleet operates with far more capital than is deployed by any of its competitors\nworldwide. That financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cash Berkshire annually receives from its\nnon-insurance businesses, allows our insurance companies to safely follow an equity-heavy investment strategy not\nfeasible for the overwhelming majority of insurers. Those competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons,\nmust focus on bonds.\nAnd bonds are not the place to be these days. Can you believe that the income recently available from a\n10-year U. S. Treasury bond – the yield was 0.93% at yearend – had fallen 94% from the 15.8% yield available in\nSeptember 1981? In certain large and important countries, such as Germany and Japan, investors earn a negative return\non trillions of dollars of sovereign debt. Fixed-income investors worldwide – whether pension funds, insurance\ncompanies or retirees – face a bleak future.\n\nSome insurers, as well as other bond investors, may try to juice the pathetic returns now available by shifting\ntheir purchases to obligations backed by shaky borrowers. Risky loans, however, are not the answer to inadequate\ninterest rates. Three decades ago, the once-mighty savings and loan industry destroyed itself, partly by ignoring that\nmaxim.\nBerkshire now enjoys $138 billion of insurance “float” – funds that do not belong to us, but are nevertheless\nours to deploy, whether in bonds, stocks or cash equivalents such as U. S. Treasury bills. Float has some similarities\nto bank deposits: cash flows in and out daily to insurers, with the total they hold changing very little. The massive\nsum held by Berkshire is likely to remain near its present level for many years and, on a cumulative basis, has been\ncostless to us. That happy result, of course, could change – but, over time, I like our odds.\nI have repetitiously – some might say endlessly – explained our insurance operation in my annual letters to\nyou. Therefore, I will this year ask new shareholders who wish to learn more about our insurance business and “float”\nto read the pertinent section of the 2019 report, reprinted on page A-2. It’s important that you understand the risks,\nas well as the opportunities, existing in our insurance activities.\nOur second and third most valuable assets – it’s pretty much a toss-up at this point – are Berkshire’s 100%\nownership of BNSF, America’s largest railroad measured by freight volume, and our 5.4% ownership of Apple. And\nin the fourth spot is our 91% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”). What we have here is a very unusual\nutility business, whose annual earnings have grown from $122 million to $3.4 billion during our 21 years of ownership.\nI’ll have more to say about BNSF and BHE later in this letter. For now, however, I would like to focus on a\npractice Berkshire will periodically use to enhance your interest in both its “Big Four” as well as the many other assets\nBerkshire owns.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLast year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire’s spread of properties by repurchasing the\nequivalent of 80,998 “A” shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process. That action increased your ownership in all of\nBerkshire’s businesses by 5.2% without requiring you to so much as touch your wallet.\nFollowing criteria Charlie and I have long recommended, we made those purchases because we believed they\nwould both enhance the intrinsic value per share for continuing shareholders and would leave Berkshire with more\nthan ample funds for any opportunities or problems it might encounter.\nIn no way do we think that Berkshire shares should be repurchased at simply any price. I emphasize that\npoint because American CEOs have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases when\nprices have risen than when they have tanked. Our approach is exactly the reverse.\nBerkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock\nlate in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that,\nI’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and\nseparately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in\nmid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.\nOur cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about\n$775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our\nposition.\nDespite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming\nabout because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has\noutstanding.\n\n⁄\nBut that’s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshire shares during the 21 years,\nyou now indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.\nThis agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to\nfurther reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. As\nthese reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSF\nand BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.\nThe math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time. The process offers a simple way\nfor investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses.\nAnd as a sultry Mae West assured us: “Too much of a good thing can be . . . wonderful.”",

    "content": "A Tale of Two Cities\nSuccess stories abound throughout America. Since our country’s birth, individuals with an idea, ambition\nand often just a pittance of capital have succeeded beyond their dreams by creating something new or by improving\nthe customer’s experience with something old.\nCharlie and I journeyed throughout the nation to join with many of these individuals or their families. On the\nWest Coast, we began the routine in 1972 with our purchase of See’s Candy. A full century ago, Mary See set out to\ndeliver an age-old product that she had reinvented with special recipes. Added to her business plan were quaint stores\nstaffed by friendly salespeople. Her first small outlet in Los Angeles eventually led to several hundred shops, spread\nthroughout the West.\nToday, Mrs. See’s creations continue to delight customers while providing life-long employment for\nthousands of women and men. Berkshire’s job is simply not to meddle with the company’s success. When a business\nmanufactures and distributes a non-essential consumer product, the customer is the boss. And, after 100 years, the\ncustomer’s message to Berkshire remains clear: “Don’t mess with my candy.” (The website is https://www. sees. com/;\ntry the peanut brittle.)\nLet’s move across the continent to Washington, D. C. In 1936, Leo Goodwin, along with his wife, Lillian,\nbecame convinced that auto insurance – a standardized product customarily purchased from agents – could be sold\ndirectly at a much lower price. Armed with $100,000, the pair took on giant insurers possessing 1,000 times or more\ntheir capital. Government Employees Insurance Company (later shortened to GEICO) was on its way.\nBy luck, I was exposed to the company’s potential a full 70 years ago. It instantly became my first love (of\nan investment sort). You know the rest of the story: Berkshire eventually became the 100% owner of GEICO, which\nat 84 years of age is constantly fine-tuning – but not changing – the vision of Leo and Lillian.\nThere has been, however, a change in the company’s size. In 1937, its first full year of operation, GEICO did\n$238,288 of business. Last year the figure was $35 billion.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nToday, with much of finance, media, government and tech located in coastal areas, it’s easy to overlook the\nmany miracles occurring in middle America. Let’s focus on two communities that provide stunning illustrations of\nthe talent and ambition existing throughout our country.\nYou will not be surprised that I begin with Omaha.\nIn 1940, Jack Ringwalt, a graduate of Omaha’s Central High School (the alma mater as well of Charlie, my\ndad, my first wife, our three children and two grandchildren), decided to start a property/casualty insurance company\nfunded by $125,000 in capital.\nJack’s dream was preposterous, requiring his pipsqueak operation – somewhat pompously christened as\nNational Indemnity – to compete with giant insurers, all of which operated with abundant capital. Additionally, those\ncompetitors were solidly entrenched with nationwide networks of well-funded and long-established local agents.\nUnder Jack’s plan, National Indemnity, unlike GEICO, would itself use whatever agencies deigned to accept it and\nconsequently enjoy no cost advantage in its acquisition of business. To overcome those formidable handicaps,\nNational Indemnity focused on “odd-ball” risks, which were deemed unimportant by the “big boys.” And, improbably,\nthe strategy succeeded.\nJack was honest, shrewd, likeable and a bit quirky. In particular, he disliked regulators. When he periodically\nbecame annoyed with their supervision, he would feel an urge to sell his company.\n\nFortunately, I was nearby on one of those occasions. Jack liked the idea of joining Berkshire, and we made a\ndeal in 1967, taking all of 15 minutes to reach a handshake. I never asked for an audit.\nToday National Indemnity is the only company in the world prepared to insure certain giant risks. And, yes,\nit remains based in Omaha, a few miles from Berkshire’s home office.\nOver the years, we have purchased four additional businesses from Omaha families, the best known among\nthem being Nebraska Furniture Mart (“NFM”). The company’s founder, Rose Blumkin (“Mrs. B”), arrived in Seattle\nin 1915 as a Russian emigrant, unable to read or speak English. She settled in Omaha several years later and by 1936\nhad saved $2,500 with which to start a furniture store.\nCompetitors and suppliers ignored her, and for a time their judgment seemed correct: World War II stalled\nher business, and at yearend 1946, the company’s net worth had grown to only $72,264. Cash, both in the till and on\ndeposit, totaled $50 (that’s not a typo).\nOne invaluable asset, however, went unrecorded in the 1946 figures: Louie Blumkin, Mrs. B’s only son, had\nrejoined the store after four years in the U. S. Army. Louie fought at Normandy’s Omaha Beach following the D-Day\ninvasion, earned a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in the Battle of the Bulge, and finally sailed home in November\n1945.\nOnce Mrs. B and Louie were reunited, there was no stopping NFM. Driven by their dream, mother and son\nworked days, nights and weekends. The result was a retailing miracle.\nBy 1983, the pair had created a business worth $60 million. That year, on my birthday, Berkshire purchased\n80% of NFM, again without an audit. I counted on Blumkin family members to run the business; the third and fourth\ngeneration do so today. Mrs. B, it should be noted, worked daily until she was 103 – a ridiculously premature\nretirement age as judged by Charlie and me.\nNFM now owns the three largest home-furnishings stores in the U. S. Each set a sales record in 2020, a feat\nachieved despite the closing of NFM’s stores for more than six weeks because of COVID-19.\nA post-script to this story says it all: When Mrs. B’s large family gathered for holiday meals, she always\nasked that they sing a song before eating. Her selection never varied: Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLet’s move somewhat east to Knoxville, the third largest city in Tennessee. There, Berkshire has ownership\nin two remarkable companies – Clayton Homes (100% owned) and Pilot Travel Centers (38% owned now, but headed\nfor 80% in 2023).\nEach company was started by a young man who had graduated from the University of Tennessee and stayed\nput in Knoxville. Neither had a meaningful amount of capital nor wealthy parents.\nBut, so what? Today, Clayton and Pilot each have annual pre-tax earnings of more than $1 billion. Together\nthey employ about 47,000 men and women.\nJim Clayton, after several other business ventures, founded Clayton Homes on a shoestring in 1956, and “Big\nJim” Haslam started what became Pilot Travel Centers in 1958 by purchasing a service station for $6,000. Each of the\nmen later brought into the business a son with the same passion, values and brains as his father. Sometimes there is a\nmagic to genes.\n\n“Big Jim” Haslam, now 90, has recently authored an inspirational book in which he relates how Jim Clayton’s\nson, Kevin, encouraged the Haslams to sell a large portion of Pilot to Berkshire. Every retailer knows that satisfied\ncustomers are a store’s best salespeople. That’s true when businesses are changing hands as well.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWhen you next fly over Knoxville or Omaha, tip your hat to the Claytons, Haslams and Blumkins as well as\nto the army of successful entrepreneurs who populate every part of our country. These builders needed America’s\nframework for prosperity – a unique experiment when it was crafted in 1789 – to achieve their potential. In turn,\nAmerica needed citizens like Jim C., Jim H., Mrs. B and Louie to accomplish the miracles our founding fathers sought.\nToday, many people forge similar miracles throughout the world, creating a spread of prosperity that benefits\nall of humanity. In its brief 232 years of existence, however, there has been no incubator for unleashing human\npotential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country’s economic progress has been breathtaking.\nBeyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming “a more perfect union.” Progress on that\nfront has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so.\nOur unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America.",

    "content": "The Berkshire Partnership\nBerkshire is a Delaware corporation, and our directors must follow the state’s laws. Among them is a\nrequirement that board members must act in the best interest of the corporation and its stockholders. Our directors\nembrace that doctrine.\nIn addition, of course, Berkshire directors want the company to delight its customers, to develop and reward\nthe talents of its 360,000 associates, to behave honorably with lenders and to be regarded as a good citizen of the many\ncities and states in which we operate. We value these four important constituencies.\nNone of these groups, however, have a vote in determining such matters as dividends, strategic direction,\nCEO selection, or acquisitions and divestitures. Responsibilities like those fall solely on Berkshire’s directors, who\nmust faithfully represent the long-term interests of the corporation and its owners.\nBeyond legal requirements, Charlie and I feel a special obligation to the many individual shareholders of\nBerkshire. A bit of personal history may help you to understand our unusual attachment and how it shapes our\nbehavior.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBefore my Berkshire years, I managed money for many individuals through a series of partnerships, the first\nthree of those formed in 1956. As time passed, the use of multiple entities became unwieldy and, in 1962, we\namalgamated 12 partnerships into a single unit, Buffett Partnership Ltd. (“BPL”).\nBy that year, virtually all of my own money, and that of my wife as well, had become invested alongside the\nfunds of my many limited partners. I received no salary or fees. Instead, as the general partner, I was compensated by\nmy limited partners only after they secured returns above an annual threshold of 6%. If returns failed to meet that\nlevel, the shortfall was to be carried forward against my share of future profits. (Fortunately, that never happened:\nPartnership returns always exceeded the 6% “bogey.”) As the years went by, a large part of the resources of my\nparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws became invested in the partnership.\n\nCharlie formed his partnership in 1962 and operated much as I did. Neither of us had any institutional\ninvestors, and very few of our partners were financially sophisticated. The people who joined our ventures simply\ntrusted us to treat their money as we treated our own. These individuals – either intuitively or by relying on the advice\nof friends – correctly concluded that Charlie and I had an extreme aversion to permanent loss of capital and that we\nwould not have accepted their money unless we expected to do reasonably well with it.\nI stumbled into business management after BPL acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. Later still, in 1969,\nwe decided to dissolve BPL. After yearend, the partnership distributed, pro-rata, all of its cash along with three stocks,\nthe largest by value being BPL’s 70.5% interest in Berkshire.\nCharlie, meanwhile, wound up his operation in 1977. Among the assets he distributed to partners was a major\ninterest in Blue Chip Stamps, a company his partnership, Berkshire and I jointly controlled. Blue Chip was also among\nthe three stocks my partnership had distributed upon its dissolution.\nIn 1983, Berkshire and Blue Chip merged, thereby expanding Berkshire’s base of registered shareholders\nfrom 1,900 to 2,900. Charlie and I wanted everyone – old, new and prospective shareholders – to be on the same page.\nTherefore, the 1983 annual report – up front – laid out Berkshire’s “major business principles.” The first\nprinciple began: “Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.” That defined our relationship in 1983;\nit defines it today. Charlie and I – and our directors as well – believe this dictum will serve Berkshire well for many\ndecades to come.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOwnership of Berkshire now resides in five large “buckets,” one occupied by me as a “founder” of sorts.\nThat bucket is certain to empty as the shares I own are annually distributed to various philanthropies.\nTwo of the remaining four buckets are filled by institutional investors, each handling other people’s money.\nThat, however, is where the similarity between those buckets ends: Their investing procedures could not be more\ndifferent.\nIn one institutional bucket are index funds, a large and mushrooming segment of the investment world. These\nfunds simply mimic the index that they track. The favorite of index investors is the S&P 500, of which Berkshire is a\ncomponent. Index funds, it should be emphasized, own Berkshire shares simply because they are required to do so.\nThey are on automatic pilot, buying and selling only for “weighting” purposes.\nIn the other institutional bucket are professionals who manage their clients’ money, whether those funds\nbelong to wealthy individuals, universities, pensioners or whomever. These professional managers have a mandate to\nmove funds from one investment to another based on their judgment as to valuation and prospects. That is an\nhonorable, though difficult, occupation.\nWe are happy to work for this “active” group, while they meanwhile search for a better place to deploy the\nfunds of their clientele. Some managers, to be sure, have a long-term focus and trade very infrequently. Others use\ncomputers employing algorithms that may direct the purchase or sale of shares in a nano-second. Some professional\ninvestors will come and go based upon their macro-economic judgments.\nOur fourth bucket consists of individual shareholders who operate in a manner similar to the active\ninstitutional managers I’ve just described. These owners, understandably, think of their Berkshire shares as a possible\nsource of funds when they see another investment that excites them. We have no quarrel with that attitude, which is\nsimilar to the way we look at some of the equities we own at Berkshire.\n\nAll of that said, Charlie and I would be less than human if we did not feel a special kinship with our fifth\nbucket: the million-plus individual investors who simply trust us to represent their interests, whatever the future may\nbring. They have joined us with no intent to leave, adopting a mindset similar to that held by our original partners.\nIndeed, many investors from our partnership years, and/or their descendants, remain substantial owners of Berkshire.\nA prototype of those veterans is Stan Truhlsen, a cheerful and generous Omaha ophthalmologist as well as\npersonal friend, who turned 100 on November 13,2020. In 1959, Stan, along with 10 other young Omaha doctors,\nformed a partnership with me. The docs creatively labeled their venture Emdee, Ltd. Annually, they joined my wife\nand me for a celebratory dinner at our home.\nWhen our partnership distributed its Berkshire shares in 1969, all of the doctors kept the stock they received.\nThey may not have known the ins and outs of investing or accounting, but they did know that at Berkshire they would\nbe treated as partners.\nTwo of Stan’s comrades from Emdee are now in their high-90 s and continue to hold Berkshire shares. This\ngroup’s startling durability – along with the fact that Charlie and I are 97 and 90, respectively – serves up an interesting\nquestion: Could it be that Berkshire ownership fosters longevity?\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire’s unusual and valued family of individual shareholders may add to your understanding of our\nreluctance to court Wall Street analysts and institutional investors. We already have the investors we want and don’t\nthink that they, on balance, would be upgraded by replacements.\nThere are only so many seats – that is, shares outstanding – available for Berkshire ownership. And we very\nmuch like the people already occupying them.\nOf course, some turnover in “partners” will occur. Charlie and I hope, however, that it will be minimal. Who,\nafter all, seeks rapid turnover in friends, neighbors or marriage?\nIn 1958, Phil Fisher wrote a superb book on investing. In it, he analogized running a public company to\nmanaging a restaurant. If you are seeking diners, he said, you can attract a clientele and prosper featuring either\nhamburgers served with a Coke or a French cuisine accompanied by exotic wines. But you must not, Fisher warned,\ncapriciously switch from one to the other: Your message to potential customers must be consistent with what they will\nfind upon entering your premises.\nAt Berkshire, we have been serving hamburgers and Coke for 56 years. We cherish the clientele this fare has\nattracted.\nThe tens of millions of other investors and speculators in the United States and elsewhere have a wide variety\nof equity choices to fit their tastes. They will find CEOs and market gurus with enticing ideas. If they want price\ntargets, managed earnings and “stories,” they will not lack suitors. “Technicians” will confidently instruct them as to\nwhat some wiggles on a chart portend for a stock’s next move. The calls for action will never stop.\nMany of those investors, I should add, will do quite well. After all, ownership of stocks is very much a\n“positive-sum” game. Indeed, a patient and level-headed monkey, who constructs a portfolio by throwing 50 darts at\na board listing all of the S&P 500, will – over time – enjoy dividends and capital gains, just as long as it never gets\ntempted to make changes in its original “selections.”\n\nProductive assets such as farms, real estate and, yes, business ownership produce wealth – lots of it. Most\nowners of such properties will be rewarded. All that’s required is the passage of time, an inner calm, ample\ndiversification and a minimization of transactions and fees. Still, investors must never forget that their expenses are\nWall Street’s income. And, unlike my monkey, Wall Streeters do not work for peanuts.\nWhen seats open up at Berkshire – and we hope they are few – we want them to be occupied by newcomers\nwho understand and desire what we offer. After decades of management, Charlie and I remain unable to promise\nresults. We can and do, however, pledge to treat you as partners.\nAnd so, too, will our successors.",

    "content": "A Berkshire Number that May Surprise You\nRecently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based\nproperty, plant and equipment – the sort of assets that make up the “business infrastructure” of our country – with a\nGAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by any other U. S. company. Berkshire’s depreciated cost of these\ndomestic “fixed assets” is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with property, plant and equipment of $127\nbillion.\nOur leadership in fixed-asset ownership, I should add, does not, in itself, signal an investment triumph. The\nbest results occur at companies that require minimal assets to conduct high-margin businesses – and offer goods or\nservices that will expand their sales volume with only minor needs for additional capital. We, in fact, own a few of\nthese exceptional businesses, but they are relatively small and, at best, grow slowly.\nAsset-heavy companies, however, can be good investments. Indeed, we are delighted with our two\ngiants – BNSF and BHE: In 2011, Berkshire’s first full year of BNSF ownership, the two companies had combined\nearnings of $4.2 billion. In 2020, a tough year for many businesses, the pair earned $8.3 billion.\nBNSF and BHE will require major capital expenditures for decades to come. The good news is that both are\nlikely to deliver appropriate returns on the incremental investment.\nLet’s look first at BNSF. Your railroad carries about 15% of all non-local ton-miles (a ton of freight moved\none mile) of goods that move in the United States, whether by rail, truck, pipeline, barge or aircraft. By a significant\nmargin, BNSF’s loads top those of any other carrier.\nThe history of American railroads is fascinating. After 150 years or so of frenzied construction, skullduggery,\noverbuilding, bankruptcies, reorganizations and mergers, the railroad industry finally emerged a few decades ago as\nmature and rationalized.\nBNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedents\nwhose railroads have been purchased or merged. The company’s extensive lineage is laid out at\nhttp://www. bnsf. com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy. pdf.\nBerkshire acquired BNSF early in 2010. Since our purchase, the railroad has invested $41 billion in fixed\nassets, an outlay $20 billion in excess of its depreciation charges. Railroading is an outdoor sport, featuring mile-long\ntrains obliged to reliably operate in both extreme cold and heat, as they all the while encounter every form of terrain\nfrom deserts to mountains. Massive flooding periodically occurs. BNSF owns 23,000 miles of track, spread throughout\n28 states, and must spend whatever it takes to maximize safety and service throughout its vast system.\n\nNevertheless, BNSF has paid substantial dividends to Berkshire – $41.8 billion in total. The railroad pays us,\nhowever, only what remains after it both fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about\n$2 billion. This conservative policy allows BNSF to borrow at low rates, independent of any guarantee of its debt by\nBerkshire.\nOne further word about BNSF: Last year, Carl Ice, its CEO, and his number two, Katie Farmer, did an\nextraordinary job in controlling expenses while navigating a significant downturn in business. Despite a 7% decline\nin the volume of goods carried, the two actually increased BNSF’s profit margin by 2.9 percentage points. Carl, as\nlong planned, retired at yearend and Katie took over as CEO. Your railroad is in good hands.\nBHE, unlike BNSF, pays no dividends on its common stock, a highly-unusual practice in the electric-utility\nindustry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country’s\nelectric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering. The effort will absorb all of\nBHE’s earnings for decades to come. We welcome the challenge and believe the added investment will be\nappropriately rewarded.\nLet me tell you about one of BHE’s endeavors – its $18 billion commitment to rework and expand a\nsubstantial portion of the outdated grid that now transmits electricity throughout the West. BHE began this project in\n2006 and expects it to be completed by 2030 – yes, 2030.\nThe advent of renewable energy made our project a societal necessity. Historically, the coal-based generation\nof electricity that long prevailed was located close to huge centers of population. The best sites for the new world of\nwind and solar generation, however, are often in remote areas. When BHE assessed the situation in 2006, it was no\nsecret that a huge investment in western transmission lines had to be made. Very few companies or governmental\nentities, however, were in a financial position to raise their hand after they tallied the project’s cost.\nBHE’s decision to proceed, it should be noted, was based upon its trust in America’s political, economic and\njudicial systems. Billions of dollars needed to be invested before meaningful revenue would flow. Transmission lines\nhad to cross the borders of states and other jurisdictions, each with its own rules and constituencies. BHE would also\nneed to deal with hundreds of landowners and execute complicated contracts with both the suppliers that generated\nrenewable power and the far-away utilities that would distribute the electricity to their customers. Competing interests\nand defenders of the old order, along with unrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly-new world, had to be brought on\nboard.\nBoth surprises and delays were certain. Equally certain, however, was the fact that BHE had the managerial\ntalent, the institutional commitment and the financial wherewithal to fulfill its promises. Though it will be many years\nbefore our western transmission project is completed, we are today searching for other projects of similar size to take\non.\nWhatever the obstacles, BHE will be a leader in delivering ever-cleaner energy.",

    "content": "The Annual Meeting\nLast year, on February 22 nd, I wrote you about our plans for a gala annual meeting. Within a month, the\nschedule was junked.\nOur home office group, led by Melissa Shapiro and Marc Hamburg, Berkshire’s CFO, quickly regrouped.\nMiraculously, their improvisations worked. Greg Abel, one of Berkshire’s Vice Chairmen, joined me on stage facing\na dark arena, 18,000 empty seats and a camera. There was no rehearsal: Greg and I arrived about 45 minutes before\n“showtime.”\n\nDebbie Bosanek, my incredible assistant who joined Berkshire 47 years ago at age 17, had put together about\n25 slides displaying various facts and figures that I had assembled at home. An anonymous but highly-capable team\nof computer and camera operators projected the slides onto the screen in proper order.\nYahoo streamed the proceedings to a record-sized international audience. Becky Quick of CNBC, operating\nfrom her home in New Jersey, selected questions from thousands that shareholders had earlier submitted or that\nviewers had emailed to her during the four hours Greg and I were on stage. See’s peanut brittle and fudge, along with\nCoca-Cola, provided us with nourishment.\nThis year, on May 1 st, we are planning to go one better. Again, we will rely on Yahoo and CNBC to perform\nflawlessly. Yahoo will go live at 1 p. m. Eastern Daylight Time (“EDT”). Simply navigate to\nhttps://finance. yahoo. com/brklivestream.\nOur formal meeting will commence at 5: 00 p. m. EDT and should finish by 5: 30 p. m. Earlier, between\n1: 30-5: 00, we will answer your questions as relayed by Becky. As always, we will have no foreknowledge as to what\nquestions will be asked. Send your zingers to Berkshire Questions@cnbc. com. Yahoo will wrap things up after 5: 30.\nAnd now – drum roll, please – a surprise. This year our meeting will be held in Los Angeles . . . and Charlie\n⁄\nwill be on stage with me offering answers and observations throughout the 31 -hour question period. I missed him last\nyear and, more important, you clearly missed him. Our other invaluable vice-chairmen, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, will\nbe with us to answer questions relating to their domains.\nJoin us via Yahoo. Direct your really tough questions to Charlie! We will have fun, and we hope you will as\nwell.\nBetter yet, of course, will be the day when we see you face to face. I hope and expect that will be in 2022.\nThe citizens of Omaha, our exhibiting subsidiaries and all of us at the home office can’t wait to get you back for an\nhonest-to-God annual meeting, Berkshire-style.\nFebruary 27,2021 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
