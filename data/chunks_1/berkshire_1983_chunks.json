    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nThis past year our registered shareholders increased from\nabout 1900 to about 2900. Most of this growth resulted from our\nmerger with Blue Chip Stamps, but there also was an acceleration\nin the pace of natural increase that has raised us from the\n1000 level a few years ago.\n\nWith so many new shareholders, its appropriate to summarize\nthe major business principles we follow that pertain to the\nmanager-owner relationship:\n\no\nAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is\npartnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as\nowner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because\nof the size of our shareholdings we also are, for better or\nworse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself\nas the ultimate owner of our business assets but, instead, view\nthe company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the\nassets.\n\no\nIn line with this owner-orientation, our directors are all\nmajor shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. In the case of at\nleast four of the five, over 50% of family net worth is\nrepresented by holdings of Berkshire. We eat our own cooking.\n\no\nOur long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications\nmentioned later) is to maximize the average annual rate of gain\nin intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not\nmeasure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by\nits size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that\nthe rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a\ngreatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be\ndisappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average\nlarge American corporation.\n\no\nOur preference would be to reach this goal by directly\nowning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and\nconsistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second\nchoice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily\nthrough purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance\nsubsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the\nneed for insurance capital determine any given years capital\nallocation.\n\no\nBecause of this two-pronged approach to business ownership\nand because of the limitations of conventional accounting,\nconsolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about\nour true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and\nmanagers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However,\nwe will also report to you the earnings of each major business we\ncontrol, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures,\nalong with other information we will supply about the individual\nbusinesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about\nthem.\n\no\nAccounting consequences do not influence our operating or\ncapital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are\nsimilar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not\nreportable by us under standard accounting principles than to\npurchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely\nthe choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose\nearnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the\npro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely\nunreportable). In aggregate and over time, we expect the\nunreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic\nbusiness value through capital gains.\n\no\nWe rarely use much debt and, when we do, we attempt to\nstructure it on a long-term fixed rate basis. We will reject\ninteresting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance\nsheet. This conservatism has penalized our results but it is the\nonly behavior that leaves us comfortable, considering our\nfiduciary obligations to policyholders, depositors, lenders and\nthe many equity holders who have committed unusually large\nportions of their net worth to our care.\n\no\nA managerial wish list will not be filled at shareholder\nexpense. We will not diversify by purchasing entire businesses\nat control prices that ignore long-term economic consequences to\nour shareholders. We will only do with your money what we would\ndo with our own, weighing fully the values you can obtain by\ndiversifying your own portfolios through direct purchases in the\nstock market.\n\no\nWe feel noble intentions should be checked periodically\nagainst results. We test the wisdom of retaining earnings by\nassessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at\nleast $1 of market value for each $1 retained. To date, this\ntest has been met. We will continue to apply it on a five-year\nrolling basis. As our net worth grows, it is more difficult to\nuse retained earnings wisely.\n\no\nWe will issue common stock only when we receive as much in\nbusiness value as we give. This rule applies to all forms of\nissuance - not only mergers or public stock offerings, but stock\nfor-debt swaps, stock options, and convertible securities as\nwell. We will not sell small portions of your company - and that\nis what the issuance of shares amounts to - on a basis\ninconsistent with the value of the entire enterprise.\n\no\nYou should be fully aware of one attitude Charlie and I\nshare that hurts our financial performance: regardless of price,\nwe have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that\nBerkshire owns, and are very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses\nas long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as\nlong as we feel good about their managers and labor relations.\nWe hope not to repeat the capital-allocation mistakes that led us\ninto such sub-par businesses. And we react with great caution to\nsuggestions that our poor businesses can be restored to\nsatisfactory profitability by major capital expenditures. (The\nprojections will be dazzling - the advocates will be sincere -\nbut, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible\nindustry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in\nquicksand.) Nevertheless, gin rummy managerial behavior (discard\nyour least promising business at each turn) is not our style. We\nwould rather have our overall results penalized a bit than engage\nin it.\n\no\nWe will be candid in our reporting to you, emphasizing the\npluses and minuses important in appraising business value. Our\nguideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to\nknow if our positions were reversed. We owe you no less.\nMoreover, as a company with a major communications business, it\nwould be inexcusable for us to apply lesser standards of\naccuracy, balance and incisiveness when reporting on ourselves\nthan we would expect our news people to apply when reporting on\nothers. We also believe candor benefits us as managers: the CEO\nwho misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in\nprivate.\n\no\nDespite our policy of candor, we will discuss our\nactivities in marketable securities only to the extent legally\nrequired. Good investment ideas are rare, valuable and subject\nto competitive appropriation just as good product or business\nacquisition ideas are. Therefore, we normally will not talk\nabout our investment ideas. This ban extends even to securities\nwe have sold (because we may purchase them again) and to stocks\nwe are incorrectly rumored to be buying. If we deny those\nreports but say no comment on other occasions, the no-comments\nbecome confirmation.\n\nThat completes the catechism, and we can now move on to the\nhigh point of 1983 - the acquisition of a majority interest in\nNebraska Furniture Mart and our association with Rose Blumkin and\nher family.\n",

    "content": "\nNebraska Furniture Mart\n\nLast year, in discussing how managers with bright, but\nadrenalin-soaked minds scramble after foolish acquisitions, I\nquoted Pascal: It has struck me that all the misfortunes of men\nspring from the single cause that they are unable to stay quietly\nin one room.\n\nEven Pascal would have left the room for Mrs. Blumkin.\n\nAbout 67 years ago Mrs. Blumkin, then 23, talked her way\npast a border guard to leave Russia for America. She had no\nformal education, not even at the grammar school level, and knew\nno English. After some years in this country, she learned the\nlanguage when her older daughter taught her, every evening, the\nwords she had learned in school during the day.\n\nIn 1937, after many years of selling used clothing, Mrs.\nBlumkin had saved $500 with which to realize her dream of opening\na furniture store. Upon seeing the American Furniture Mart in\nChicago - then the center of the nations wholesale furniture\nactivity - she decided to christen her dream Nebraska Furniture\nMart.\n\nShe met every obstacle you would expect (and a few you\nwouldnt) when a business endowed with only $500 and no\nlocational or product advantage goes up against rich, longentrenched competition. At one early point, when her tiny\nresources ran out, Mrs. B (a personal trademark now as well\nrecognized in Greater Omaha as Coca-Cola or Sanka) coped in a way\nnot taught at business schools: she simply sold the furniture and\nappliances from her home in order to pay creditors precisely as\npromised.\n\nOmaha retailers began to recognize that Mrs. B would offer\ncustomers far better deals than they had been giving, and they\npressured furniture and carpet manufacturers not to sell to her.\nBut by various strategies she obtained merchandise and cut prices\nsharply. Mrs. B was then hauled into court for violation of Fair\nTrade laws. She not only won all the cases, but received\ninvaluable publicity. At the end of one case, after\ndemonstrating to the court that she could profitably sell carpet\nat a huge discount from the prevailing price, she sold the judge\n$1400 worth of carpet.\n\nToday Nebraska Furniture Mart generates over $100 million of\nsales annually out of one 200,000 square-foot store. No other\nhome furnishings store in the country comes close to that volume.\nThat single store also sells more furniture, carpets, and\nappliances than do all Omaha competitors combined.\n\nOne question I always ask myself in appraising a business is\nhow I would like, assuming I had ample capital and skilled\npersonnel, to compete with it. Id rather wrestle grizzlies than\ncompete with Mrs. B and her progeny. They buy brilliantly, they\noperate at expense ratios competitors dont even dream about, and\nthey then pass on to their customers much of the savings. Its\nthe ideal business - one built upon exceptional value to the\ncustomer that in turn translates into exceptional economics for\nits owners.\n\nMrs. B is wise as well as smart and, for far-sighted family\nreasons, was willing to sell the business last year. I had\nadmired both the family and the business for decades, and a deal\nwas quickly made. But Mrs. B, now 90, is not one to go home and\nrisk, as she puts it, losing her marbles. She remains Chairman\nand is on the sales floor seven days a week. Carpet sales are\nher specialty. She personally sells quantities that would be a\ngood departmental total for other carpet retailers.\n\nWe purchased 90% of the business - leaving 10% with members\nof the family who are involved in management - and have optioned\n10% to certain key young family managers.\n\nAnd what managers they are. Geneticists should do\nhandsprings over the Blumkin family. Louie Blumkin, Mrs. Bs\nson, has been President of Nebraska Furniture Mart for many years\nand is widely regarded as the shrewdest buyer of furniture and\nappliances in the country. Louie says he had the best teacher,\nand Mrs. B says she had the best student. Theyre both right.\nLouie and his three sons all have the Blumkin business ability,\nwork ethic, and, most important, character. On top of that, they\nare really nice people. We are delighted to be in partnership\nwith them.\n",

    "content": "\nCorporate Performance\n\nDuring 1983 our book value increased from $737.43 per share\nto $975.83 per share, or by 32%. We never take the one-year\nfigure very seriously. After all, why should the time required\nfor a planet to circle the sun synchronize precisely with the\ntime required for business actions to pay off? Instead, we\nrecommend not less than a five-year test as a rough yardstick of\neconomic performance. Red lights should start flashing if the\nfive-year average annual gain falls much below the return on\nequity earned over the period by American industry in aggregate.\n(Watch out for our explanation if that occurs as Goethe observed,\nWhen ideas fail, words come in very handy.)\n\nDuring the 19-year tenure of present management, book value\nhas grown from $19.46 per share to $975.83, or 22.6% compounded\nannually. Considering our present size, nothing close to this\nrate of return can be sustained. Those who believe otherwise\nshould pursue a career in sales, but avoid one in mathematics.\n\nWe report our progress in terms of book value because in our\ncase (though not, by any means, in all cases) it is a\nconservative but reasonably adequate proxy for growth in\nintrinsic business value -\nthe measurement that really counts.\n\nBook values virtue as a score-keeping measure is that it is easy\nto calculate and doesnt involve the subjective (but important)\njudgments employed in calculation of intrinsic business value.\nIt is important to understand, however, that the two terms - book\nvalue and intrinsic business value - have very different\nmeanings.\n\nBook value is an accounting concept, recording the\naccumulated financial input from both contributed capital and\nretained earnings. Intrinsic business value is an economic\nconcept, estimating future cash output discounted to present\nvalue. Book value tells you what has been put in; intrinsic\nbusiness value estimates what can be taken out.\n\nAn analogy will suggest the difference. Assume you spend\nidentical amounts putting each of two children through college.\nThe book value (measured by financial input) of each childs\neducation would be the same. But the present value of the future\npayoff (the intrinsic business value) might vary enormously -\nfrom zero to many times the cost of the education. So, also, do\nbusinesses having equal financial input end up with wide\nvariations in value.\n\nAt Berkshire, at the beginning of fiscal 1965 when the\npresent management took over, the $19.46 per share book value\nconsiderably overstated intrinsic business value. All of that\nbook value consisted of textile assets that could not earn, on\naverage, anything close to an appropriate rate of return. In the\nterms of our analogy, the investment in textile assets resembled\ninvestment in a largely-wasted education.\n\nNow, however, our intrinsic business value considerably\nexceeds book value. There are two major reasons:\n\n(1) Standard accounting principles require that common\nstocks held by our insurance subsidiaries be stated on\nour books at market value, but that other stocks we own\nbe carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nAt the end of 1983, the market value of this latter\ngroup exceeded carrying value by $70 million pre-tax,\nor about $50 million after tax. This excess belongs in\nour intrinsic business value, but is not included in\nthe calculation of book value;\n\n(2) More important, we own several businesses that possess\neconomic Goodwill (which is properly includable in\nintrinsic business value) far larger than the\naccounting Goodwill that is carried on our balance\nsheet and reflected in book value.\n\nGoodwill, both economic and accounting, is an arcane subject\nand requires more explanation than is appropriate here. The\nappendix that follows this letter - Goodwill and its\nAmortization: The Rules and The Realities - explains why\neconomic and accounting Goodwill can, and usually do, differ\nenormously.\n\nYou can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking\nabout Goodwill and its amortization. But students of investment\nand management should understand the nuances of the subject. My\nown thinking has changed drastically from 35 years ago when I was\ntaught to favor tangible assets and to shun businesses whose\nvalue depended largely upon economic Goodwill. This bias caused\nme to make many important business mistakes of omission, although\nrelatively few of commission.\n\nKeynes identified my problem: The difficulty lies not in\nthe new ideas but in escaping from the old ones. My escape was\nlong delayed, in part because most of what I had been taught by\nthe same teacher had been (and continues to be) so\nextraordinarily valuable. Ultimately, business experience,\ndirect and vicarious, produced my present strong preference for\nbusinesses that possess large amounts of enduring Goodwill and\nthat utilize a minimum of tangible assets.\n\nI recommend the Appendix to those who are comfortable with\naccounting terminology and who have an interest in understanding\nthe business aspects of Goodwill. Whether or not you wish to\ntackle the Appendix, you should be aware that Charlie and I\nbelieve that Berkshire possesses very significant economic\nGoodwill value above that reflected in our book value.\n",

In 1982, Berkshire owned about 60% of Blue Chip Stamps\nwhereas, in 1983, our ownership was 60% throughout the first six\nmonths and 100% thereafter. In turn, Berkshires net interest in\nWesco was 48% during 1982 and the first six months of 1983, and\n80% for the balance of 1983. Because of these changed ownership\npercentages, the first two columns of the table provide the best\nmeasure of underlying business performance.\n\nAll of the significant gains and losses attributable to\nunusual sales of assets by any of the business entities are\naggregated with securities transactions on the line near the\nbottom of the table, and are not included in operating earnings.\n(We regard any annual figure for realized capital gains or losses\nas meaningless, but we regard the aggregate realized and\nunrealized capital gains over a period of years as very\nimportant.) Furthermore, amortization of Goodwill is not charged\nagainst the specific businesses but, for reasons outlined in the\nAppendix, is set forth as a separate item.\n\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes After Tax\n-------------------------------------- ------------------\nTotal Berkshire Share Berkshire Share\n------------------ ------------------ ------------------\n1983 1982 1983 1982 1983 1982\n-------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n(000 s omitted)\n\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............ $(33,872) $(21,558) $(33,872) $(21,558) $(18,400) $(11,345)\nNet Investment Income ... 43,810 41,620 43,810 41,620 39,114 35,270\nBerkshire-Waumbec Textiles (100) (1,545) (100) (1,545) (63) (862)\nAssociated Retail Stores .. 697 914 697 914 355 446\nNebraska Furniture Mart(1) 3,812 -- 3,049 -- 1,521 --\nSees Candies ............. 27,411 23,884 24,526 14,235 12,212 6,914\nBuffalo Evening News ...... 19,352 (1,215) 16,547 (724) 8,832 (226)\nBlue Chip Stamps(2) .......

    "content": "Sources of Reported Earnings\n\n\nFor a discussion of the businesses owned by Wesco, please\nread Charlie Mungers report on pages 46-51. Charlie replaced\nLouie Vincenti as Chairman of Wesco late in 1983 when health\nforced Louies retirement at age 77. In some instances, health\nis a euphemism, but in Louies case nothing but health would\ncause us to consider his retirement. Louie is a marvelous man\nand has been a marvelous manager.\n\nThe special GEICO distribution reported in the table arose\nwhen that company made a tender offer for a portion of its stock,\nbuying both from us and other shareholders. At GEICOs request,\nwe tendered a quantity of shares that kept our ownership\npercentage the same after the transaction as before. The\nproportional nature of our sale permitted us to treat the\nproceeds as a dividend. Unlike individuals, corporations net\nconsiderably more when earnings are derived from dividends rather\nthan from capital gains, since the effective Federal income tax\nrate on dividends is 6.9% versus 28% on capital gains.\n\nEven with this special item added in, our total dividends\nfrom GEICO in 1983 were considerably less than our share of\nGEICOs earnings. Thus it is perfectly appropriate, from both an\naccounting and economic standpoint, to include the redemption\nproceeds in our reported earnings. It is because the item is\nlarge and unusual that we call your attention to it.\n\nThe table showing you our sources of earnings includes\ndividends from those non-controlled companies whose marketable\nequity securities we own. But the table does not include\nearnings those companies have retained that are applicable to our\nownership. In aggregate and over time we expect those\nundistributed earnings to be reflected in market prices and to\nincrease our intrinsic business value on a dollar-for-dollar\nbasis, just as if those earnings had been under our control and\nreported as part of our profits. That does not mean we expect\nall of our holdings to behave uniformly; some will disappoint us,\nothers will deliver pleasant surprises. To date our experience\nhas been better than we originally anticipated, In aggregate, we\nhave received far more than a dollar of market value gain for\nevery dollar of earnings retained.\n\n",

    "content": "\nBuffalo Evening News\n\nFirst, a clarification: our corporate name is Buffalo\nEvening News, Inc. but the name of the newspaper, since we began\na morning edition a little over a year ago, is Buffalo News.\n\nIn 1983 the News somewhat exceeded its targeted profit\nmargin of 10% after tax. Two factors were responsible: (1) a\nstate income tax cost that was subnormal because of a large loss\ncarry-forward, now fully utilized, and (2) a large drop in the\nper-ton cost of newsprint (an unanticipated fluke that will be\nreversed in 1984).\n\nAlthough our profit margins in 1983 were about average for\nnewspapers such as the News, the papers performance,\nnevertheless, was a significant achievement considering the\neconomic and retailing environment in Buffalo.\n\nBuffalo has a concentration of heavy industry, a segment of\nthe economy that was hit particularly hard by the recent\nrecession and that has lagged the recovery. As Buffalo consumers\nhave suffered, so also have the papers retailing customers.\nTheir numbers have shrunk over the past few years and many of\nthose surviving have cut their linage.\n\nWithin this environment the News has one exceptional\nstrength: its acceptance by the public, a matter measured by the\npapers penetration ratio - the percentage of households within\nthe community purchasing the paper each day. Our ratio is\nsuperb: for the six months ended September 30,1983 the News\nstood number one in weekday penetration among the 100 largest\npapers in the United States (the ranking is based on city zone\nnumbers compiled by the Audit Bureau of Circulations).\n\nIn interpreting the standings, it is important to note that\nmany large cities have two papers, and that in such cases the\npenetration of either paper is necessarily lower than if there\nwere a single paper, as in Buffalo. Nevertheless, the list of\nthe 100 largest papers includes many that have a city to\nthemselves. Among these, the News is at the top nationally, far\nahead of many of the countrys best-known dailies.\n\nAmong Sunday editions of these same large dailies, the News\nranks number three in penetration - ten to twenty percentage\npoints ahead of many well-known papers. It was not always this\nway in Buffalo. ",

    "content": "Buffalo Evening News\n\n\n\nWe believe a papers penetration ratio to be the best\nmeasure of the strength of its franchise. Papers with unusually\nhigh penetration in the geographical area that is of prime\ninterest to major local retailers, and with relatively little\ncirculation elsewhere, are exceptionally efficient buys for those\nretailers. Low-penetration papers have a far less compelling\nmessage to present to advertisers.\n\nIn our opinion, three factors largely account for the\nunusual acceptance of the News in the community. Among these,\npoints 2 and 3 also may explain the popularity of the Sunday News\ncompared to that of the Sunday Courier-Express when it was the\nsole Sunday paper:\n\n(1) The first point has nothing to do with merits of the\nNews. Both emigration and immigration are relatively\nlow in Buffalo. A stable population is more interested\nand involved in the activities of its community than is\na shifting population - and, as a result, is more\ninterested in the content of the local daily paper.\nIncrease the movement in and out of a city and\npenetration ratios will fall.\n\n(2) The News has a reputation for editorial quality and\nintegrity that was honed by our longtime editor, the\nlegendary Alfred Kirchhofer, and that has been preserved\nand extended by Murray Light. This reputation was\nenormously important to our success in establishing a\nSunday paper against entrenched competition. And without\na Sunday edition, the News would not have survived in the\nlong run.\n\n(3) The News lives up to its name - it delivers a very\nunusual amount of news. During 1983, our news hole\n(editorial material - not ads) amounted to 50% of the\nnewspapers content (excluding preprinted inserts).\nAmong papers that dominate their markets and that are of\ncomparable or larger size, we know of only one whose news\nhole percentage exceeds that of the News. Comprehensive\nfigures are not available, but a sampling indicates an\naverage percentage in the high 30 s. In other words, page\nfor page, our mix gives readers over 25% more news than\nthe typical paper. This news-rich mixture is by intent.\nSome publishers, pushing for higher profit margins, have\ncut their news holes during the past decade. We have\nmaintained ours and will continue to do so. Properly\nwritten and edited, a full serving of news makes our\npaper more valuable to the reader and contributes to our\nunusual penetration ratio.\n\nDespite the strength of the News franchise, gains in ROP\nlinage (advertising printed within the newspaper pages as\ncontrasted to preprinted inserts) are going to be very difficult\nto achieve. We had an enormous gain in preprints during 1983:\nlines rose from 9.3 million to 16.4 million, revenues from $3.6\nmillion to $8.1 million. These gains are consistent with\nnational trends, but exaggerated in our case by business we\npicked up when the Courier-Express closed.\n\nOn balance, the shift from ROP to preprints has negative\neconomic implications for us. Profitability on preprints is less\nand the business is more subject to competition from alternative\nmeans of delivery. Furthermore, a reduction in ROP linage means\nless absolute space devoted to news (since the news hole\npercentage remains constant), thereby reducing the utility of the\npaper to the reader.\n\nStan Lipsey became Publisher of the Buffalo News at midyear\nupon the retirement of Henry Urban. Henry never flinched during\nthe dark days of litigation and losses following our introduction\nof the Sunday paper - an introduction whose wisdom was questioned\nby many in the newspaper business, including some within our own\nbuilding. Henry is admired by the Buffalo business community,\nhes admired by all who worked for him, and he is admired by\nCharlie and me. Stan worked with Henry for several years, and\nhas worked for Berkshire Hathaway since 1969. He has been\npersonally involved in all nuts-and-bolts aspects of the\nnewspaper business from editorial to circulation. We couldnt do\nbetter.\n",

That problem concerns costs, except those for raw\nmaterials. We have enjoyed a break on raw material costs in\nrecent years though so, of course, have our competitors. One of\nthese days we will get a nasty surprise in the opposite\ndirection. In effect, raw material costs are largely beyond our\ncontrol since we will, as a matter of course, buy the finest\ningredients that we can, regardless of changes in their price\nlevels. We regard product quality as sacred.\n\nBut other kinds of costs are more controllable, and it is in\nthis area that we have had problems. On a per-pound basis, our\ncosts (not including those for raw materials) have increased in\nthe last few years at a rate significantly greater than the\nincrease in the general price level. It is vital to our\ncompetitive position and profit potential that we reverse this\ntrend.\n\nIn recent months much better control over costs has been\nattained and we feel certain that our rate of growth in these\ncosts in 1984 will be below the rate of inflation. This\nconfidence arises out of our long experience with the managerial\ntalents of Chuck Huggins. We put Chuck in charge the day we took\nover, and his record has been simply extraordinary, ",

But for many years we\noutperformed the industry in this respect and now we are not.\n\nThe poundage volume in our retail stores has been virtually\nunchanged each year for the past four, despite small increases\nevery year in the number of shops (and in distribution expense as\nwell). Of course, dollar volume has increased because we have\nraised prices significantly. But we regard the most important\nmeasure of retail trends to be units sold per store rather than\ndollar volume. On a same-store basis (counting only shops open\nthroughout both years) with all figures adjusted to a 52-week\nyear, poundage was down . 8 of 1% during 1983. This small decline\nwas our best same-store performance since 1979; the cumulative\ndecline since then has been about 8%. Quantity-order volume,\nabout 25% of our total, has plateaued in recent years following\nvery large poundage gains throughout the 1970 s.\n\nWe are not sure to what extent this flat volume - both in\nthe retail shop area and the quantity order area - is due to our\npricing policies and to what extent it is due to static industry\nvolume, the recession, and the extraordinary share of market we\nalready enjoy in our primary marketing area. Our price increase\nfor 1984 is much more modest than has been the case in the past\nfew years, and we hope that next year we can report better volume\nfigures to you. But we have no basis to forecast these.\n\nDespite the volume problem, Sees strengths are many and\nimportant. In our primary marketing area, the West, our candy is\npreferred by an enormous margin to that of any competitor. In\nfact, we believe most lovers of chocolate prefer it to candy\ncosting two or three times as much. (In candy, as in stocks,\nprice and value can differ; price is what you give, value is what\nyou get.) The quality of customer service in our shops - operated\nthroughout the country by us and not by franchisees is every bit\nas good as the product. Cheerful, helpful personnel are as much\na trademark of Sees as is the logo on the box. Thats no small\nachievement in a business that requires us to hire about 2000\nseasonal workers. We know of no comparably-sized organization\nthat betters the quality of customer service delivered by Chuck\nHuggins and his associates.\n\nBecause we have raised prices so modestly in 1984, we expect\nSees profits this year to be about the same as in 1983.\n",

    "content": "Insurance - Controlled Operations\n\n\n\nBests data reflect the experience of practically the entire\nindustry, including stock, mutual, and reciprocal companies. The\ncombined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses incurred\nplus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums; a ratio below\n100 indicates an underwriting profit and one above 100 indicates\na loss.\n\nFor the reasons outlined in last years report, we expect\nthe poor industry experience of 1983 to be more or less typical\nfor a good many years to come. (As Yogi Berra put it: It will be\ndeja vu all over again.) That doesnt mean we think the figures\nwont bounce around a bit; they are certain to. But we believe\nit highly unlikely that the combined ratio during the balance of\nthe decade will average significantly below the 1981-1983 level.\nBased on our expectations regarding inflation -\nand we are as\npessimistic as ever on that front\n- industry premium volume must\ngrow about 10% annually merely to stabilize loss ratios at\npresent levels.\n\nOur own combined ratio in 1983 was 121. Since Mike Goldberg\nrecently took over most of the responsibility for the insurance\noperation, it would be nice for me if our shortcomings could be\nplaced at his doorstep rather than mine. But unfortunately, as\nwe have often pointed out, the insurance business has a long\nlead-time. Though business policies may be changed and personnel\nimproved, a significant period must pass before the effects are\nseen. (This characteristic of the business enabled us to make a\ngreat deal of money in GEICO; we could picture what was likely to\nhappen well before it actually occurred.) So the roots of the\n1983 results are operating and personnel decisions made two or\nmore years back when I had direct managerial responsibility for\nthe insurance group.\n\nDespite our poor results overall, several of our managers\ndid truly outstanding jobs. Roland Miller guided the auto and\ngeneral liability business of National Indemnity Company and\nNational Fire and Marine Insurance Company to improved results,\nwhile those of competitors deteriorated. In addition, Tom Rowley\nat Continental Divide Insurance - our fledgling Colorado\nhomestate company - seems certain to be a winner. Mike found him\na little over a year ago, and he was an important acquisition.\n\nWe have become active recently - and hope to become much\nmore active - in reinsurance transactions where the buyers\noverriding concern should be the sellers long-term\ncreditworthiness. In such transactions our premier financial\nstrength should make us the number one choice of both claimants\nand insurers who must rely on the reinsurers promises for a\ngreat many years to come.\n\nA major source of such business is structured settlements -\na procedure for settling losses under which claimants receive\nperiodic payments (almost always monthly, for life) rather than a\nsingle lump sum settlement. This form of settlement has\nimportant tax advantages for the claimant and also prevents his\nsquandering a large lump-sum payment. Frequently, some inflation\nprotection is built into the settlement. Usually the claimant\nhas been seriously injured, and thus the periodic payments must\nbe unquestionably secure for decades to come. We believe we\noffer unparalleled security. No other insurer we know of - even\nthose with much larger gross assets - has our financial strength.\n\nWe also think our financial strength should recommend us to\ncompanies wishing to transfer loss reserves. In such\ntransactions, other insurance companies pay us lump sums to\nassume all (or a specified portion of) future loss payments\napplicable to large blocks of expired business. Here also, the\ncompany transferring such claims needs to be certain of the\ntransferees financial strength for many years to come. Again,\nmost of our competitors soliciting such business appear to us to\nhave a financial condition that is materially inferior to ours.\n\nPotentially, structured settlements and the assumption of\nloss reserves could become very significant to us. Because of\ntheir potential size and because these operations generate large\namounts of investment income compared to premium volume, we will\nshow underwriting results from those businesses on a separate\nline in our insurance segment data. We also will exclude their\neffect in reporting our combined ratio to you. We front end no\nprofit on structured settlement or loss reserve transactions, and\nall attributable overhead is expensed currently. Both businesses\nare run by Don Wurster at National Indemnity Company.\n",

Its\nsuperiority reflects the combination of a truly exceptional\nbusiness idea and an exceptional management.\n\nJack Byrne and Bill Snyder have maintained extraordinary\ndiscipline in the underwriting area (including, crucially,\nprovision for full and proper loss reserves), and their efforts\nare now being further rewarded by significant gains in new\nbusiness. Equally important, Lou Simpson is the class of the\nfield among insurance investment managers. The three of them are\nsome team.\n\nWe have approximately a one-third interest in GEICO. That\ngives us a $270 million share in the companys premium volume, an\namount some 80% larger than our own volume. Thus, the major\nportion of our total insurance business comes from the best\ninsurance book in the country. This fact does not moderate by an\niota the need for us to improve our own operation.\n",

    "content": "\nStock Splits and Stock Activity\n\nWe often are asked why Berkshire does not split its stock.\nThe assumption behind this question usually appears to be that a\nsplit would be a pro-shareholder action. We disagree. Let me\ntell you why.\n\nOne of our goals is to have Berkshire Hathaway stock sell at\na price rationally related to its intrinsic business value. (But\nnote rationally related, not identical: if well-regarded\ncompanies are generally selling in the market at large discounts\nfrom value, Berkshire might well be priced similarly.) The key to\na rational stock price is rational shareholders, both current and\nprospective.\n\nIf the holders of a companys stock and/or the prospective\nbuyers attracted to it are prone to make irrational or emotionbased decisions, some pretty silly stock prices are going to\nappear periodically. Manic-depressive personalities produce\nmanic-depressive valuations. Such aberrations may help us in\nbuying and selling the stocks of other companies. But we think\nit is in both your interest and ours to minimize their occurrence\nin the market for Berkshire.\n\nTo obtain only high quality shareholders is no cinch. Mrs.\nAstor could select her 400, but anyone can buy any stock.\nEntering members of a shareholder club cannot be screened for\nintellectual capacity, emotional stability, moral sensitivity or\nacceptable dress. Shareholder eugenics, therefore, might appear\nto be a hopeless undertaking.\n\nIn large part, however, we feel that high quality ownership\ncan be attracted and maintained if we consistently communicate\nour business and ownership philosophy -\nalong with no other\nconflicting messages\n- and then let self selection follow its\ncourse. For example, self selection will draw a far different\ncrowd to a musical event advertised as an opera than one\nadvertised as a rock concert even though anyone can buy a ticket\nto either.\n\nThrough our policies and communications - our\nadvertisements - we try to attract investors who will\nunderstand our operations, attitudes and expectations. (And,\nfully as important, we try to dissuade those who wont.) We want\nthose who think of themselves as business owners and invest in\ncompanies with the intention of staying a long time. And, we\nwant those who keep their eyes focused on business results, not\nmarket prices.\n\nInvestors possessing those characteristics are in a small\nminority, but we have an exceptional collection of them. I\nbelieve well over 90% - probably over 95% - of our shares are\nheld by those who were shareholders of Berkshire or Blue Chip\nfive years ago. And I would guess that over 95% of our shares\nare held by investors for whom the holding is at least double the\nsize of their next largest. Among companies with at least\nseveral thousand public shareholders and more than $1 billion of\nmarket value, we are almost certainly the leader in the degree to\nwhich our shareholders think and act like owners. Upgrading a\nshareholder group that possesses these characteristics is not\neasy.\n\nWere we to split the stock or take other actions focusing on\nstock price rather than business value, we would attract an\nentering class of buyers inferior to the exiting class of\nsellers. At $1300, there are very few investors who cant afford\na Berkshire share. Would a potential one-share purchaser be\nbetter off if we split 100 for 1 so he could buy 100 shares?\nThose who think so and who would buy the stock because of the\nsplit or in anticipation of one would definitely downgrade the\nquality of our present shareholder group. (Could we really\nimprove our shareholder group by trading some of our present\nclear-thinking members for impressionable new ones who,\npreferring paper to value, feel wealthier with nine $10 bills\nthan with one $100 bill?) People who buy for non-value reasons\nare likely to sell for non-value reasons. Their presence in the\npicture will accentuate erratic price swings unrelated to\nunderlying business developments.\n\nWe will try to avoid policies that attract buyers with a\nshort-term focus on our stock price and try to follow policies\nthat attract informed long-term investors focusing on business\nvalues. just as you purchased your Berkshire shares in a market\npopulated by rational informed investors, you deserve a chance to\nsell - should you ever want to - in the same kind of market. We\nwill work to keep it in existence.\n\n",

    "content": "Stock Splits and Stock Activity\n\nOne of the ironies of the stock market is the emphasis on\nactivity. Brokers, using terms such as marketability and\nliquidity, sing the praises of companies with high share\nturnover (those who cannot fill your pocket will confidently fill\nyour ear). But investors should understand that what is good for\nthe croupier is not good for the customer. A hyperactive stock\nmarket is the pickpocket of enterprise.\n\nFor example, consider a typical company earning, say, 12% on\nequity. Assume a very high turnover rate in its shares of 100%\nper year. If a purchase and sale of the stock each extract\ncommissions of 1% (the rate may be much higher on low-priced\nstocks) and if the stock trades at book value, the owners of our\nhypothetical company will pay, in aggregate, 2% of the companys\nnet worth annually for the privilege of transferring ownership.\nThis activity does nothing for the earnings of the business, and\nmeans that 1/6 of them are lost to the owners through the\nfrictional cost of transfer. (And this calculation does not\ncount option trading, which would increase frictional costs still\nfurther.)\n\nAll that makes for a rather expensive game of musical\nchairs. Can you imagine the agonized cry that would arise if a\ngovernmental unit were to impose a new 16 2/3% tax on earnings of\ncorporations or investors? By market activity, investors can\nimpose upon themselves the equivalent of such a tax.\n\nDays when the market trades 100 million shares (and that\nkind of volume, when over-the-counter trading is included, is\ntoday abnormally low) are a curse for owners, not a blessing -\nfor they mean that owners are paying twice as much to change\nchairs as they are on a 50-million-share day. If 100 millionshare days persist for a year and the average cost on each\npurchase and sale is 15 cents a share, the chair-changing tax for\ninvestors in aggregate would total about $7.5 billion - an amount\nroughly equal to the combined 1982 profits of Exxon, General\nMotors, Mobil and Texaco, the four largest companies in the\nFortune 500.\n\nThese companies had a combined net worth of $75 billion at\nyearend 1982 and accounted for over 12% of both net worth and net\nincome of the entire Fortune 500 list. Under our assumption\ninvestors, in aggregate, every year forfeit all earnings from\nthis staggering sum of capital merely to satisfy their penchant\nfor financial flip-flopping. In addition, investment\nmanagement fees of over $2 billion annually - sums paid for\nchair-changing advice - require the forfeiture by investors of\nall earnings of the five largest banking organizations (Citicorp,\nBank America, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover and J. P.\nMorgan). These expensive activities may decide who eats the pie,\nbut they dont enlarge it.\n\n(We are aware of the pie-expanding argument that says that\nsuch activities improve the rationality of the capital allocation\nprocess. We think that this argument is specious and that, on\nbalance, hyperactive equity markets subvert rational capital\nallocation and act as pie shrinkers. Adam Smith felt that all\nnoncollusive acts in a free market were guided by an invisible\nhand that led an economy to maximum progress; our view is that\ncasino-type markets and hair-trigger investment management act as\nan invisible foot that trips up and slows down a forward-moving\neconomy.)\n\nContrast the hyperactive stock with Berkshire. The bid-andask spread in our stock currently is about 30 points, or a little\nover 2%. Depending on the size of the transaction, the\ndifference between proceeds received by the seller of Berkshire\nand cost to the buyer may range downward from 4% (in trading\ninvolving only a few shares) to perhaps 1 1/2% (in large trades\nwhere negotiation can reduce both the market-makers spread and\nthe brokers commission). Because most Berkshire shares are\ntraded in fairly large transactions, the spread on all trading\nprobably does not average more than 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, true turnover in Berkshire stock (excluding\ninter-dealer transactions, gifts and bequests) probably runs 3%\nper year. Thus our owners, in aggregate, are paying perhaps\n6/100 of 1% of Berkshires market value annually for transfer\nprivileges. By this very rough estimate, thats $900,000 - not a\nsmall cost, but far less than average. Splitting the stock would\nincrease that cost, downgrade the quality of our shareholder\npopulation, and encourage a market price less consistently\nrelated to intrinsic business value. We see no offsetting\nadvantages.\n",

    "content": "Appendix — Goodwill and its Amortization: The Rules and The Realities\n\n\nAppendix\n\nAppendix\n\nGoodwill and its Amortization: The Rules and The Realities\n\nThis appendix deals only with economic and accounting Goodwill not the goodwill of everyday usage. For example, a business may be well liked, even loved, by most of its customers but possess no economic goodwill. (AT&T, before the breakup, was generally well thought of, but possessed not a dime of economic Goodwill.) And, regrettably, a business may be disliked by its customers but possess substantial, and growing, economic Goodwill. So, just for the moment, forget emotions and focus only on economics and accounting.\n\nWhen a business is purchased, accounting principles require that the purchase price first be assigned to the fair value of the identifiable assets that are acquired. Frequently the sum of the fair values put on the assets (after the deduction of liabilities) is less than the total purchase price of the business. In that case, the difference is assigned to an asset account entitled \"excess of cost over equity in net assets acquired\". To avoid constant repetition of this mouthful, we will substitute \"Goodwill\".\n\nAccounting Goodwill arising from businesses purchased before November 1970 has a special standing. Except under rare circumstances, it can remain an asset on the balance sheet as long as the business bought is retained. That means no amortization charges to gradually extinguish that asset need be made against earnings.\n\nThe case is different, however, with purchases made from November 1970 on. When these create Goodwill, it must be amortized over not more than 40 years through charges of equal amount in every year to the earnings account. Since 40 years is the maximum period allowed, 40 years is what managements (including us) usually elect. This annual charge to earnings is not allowed as a tax deduction and, thus, has an effect on after-tax income that is roughly double that of most other expenses.\n\nThats how accounting Goodwill works. To see how it differs from economic reality, lets look at an example close at hand. Well round some figures, and greatly oversimplify, to make the example easier to follow. Well also mention some implications for investors and managers.\n\nBlue Chip Stamps bought Sees early in 1972 for $25 million, at which time Sees had about $8 million of net tangible assets. (Throughout this discussion, accounts receivable will be classified as tangible assets, a definition proper for business analysis.) This level of tangible assets was adequate to conduct the business without use of debt, except for short periods seasonally. Sees was earning about $2 million after tax at the time, and such earnings seemed conservatively representative of future earning power in constant 1972 dollars.\n\nThus our first lesson: businesses logically are worth far more than net tangible assets when they can be expected to produce earnings on such assets considerably in excess of market rates of return. The capitalized value of this excess return is economic Goodwill.\n\nIn 1972 (and now) relatively few businesses could be expected to consistently earn the 25% after tax on net tangible assets that was earned by Sees doing it, furthermore, with conservative accounting and no financial leverage. It was not the fair market value of the inventories, receivables or fixed assets that produced the premium rates of return. Rather it was a combination of intangible assets, particularly a pervasive favorable reputation with consumers based upon countless pleasant experiences they have had with both product and personnel.\n\nSuch a reputation creates a consumer franchise that allows the value of the product to the purchaser, rather than its production cost, to be the major determinant of selling price. Consumer franchises are a prime source of economic Goodwill. Other sources include governmental franchises not subject to profit regulation, such as television stations, and an enduring position as the low cost producer in an industry.\n\nLets return to the accounting in the Sees example. Blue Chips purchase of Sees at $17 million over net tangible assets required that a Goodwill account of this amount be established as an asset on Blue Chips books and that $425,000 be charged to income annually for 40 years to amortize that asset. By 1983, after 11 years of such charges, the $17 million had been reduced to about $12.5 million. Berkshire, meanwhile, owned 60% of Blue Chip and, therefore, also 60% of Sees. This ownership meant that Berkshires balance sheet reflected 60% of Sees Goodwill, or about $7.5 million.\n\nIn 1983 Berkshire acquired the rest of Blue Chip in a merger that required purchase accounting as contrasted to the \"pooling\" treatment allowed for some mergers. Under purchase accounting, the \"fair value\" of the shares we gave to (or \"paid\") Blue Chip holders had to be spread over the net assets acquired from Blue Chip. This \"fair value\" was measured, as it almost always is when public companies use their shares to make acquisitions, by the market value of the shares given up.\n\nThe assets \"purchased\" consisted of 40% of everything owned by Blue Chip (as noted, Berkshire already owned the other 60%). What Berkshire \"paid\" was more than the net identifiable assets we received by $51.7 million, and was assigned to two pieces of Goodwill: $28.4 million to Sees and $23.3 million to Buffalo Evening News.\n\nAfter the merger, therefore, Berkshire was left with a Goodwill asset for Sees that had two components: the $7.5 million remaining from the 1971 purchase, and $28.4 million newly created by the 40% \"purchased\" in 1983. Our amortization charge now will be about $1.0 million for the next 28 years, and $. 7 million for the following 12 years, 2002 through 2013.\n\nIn other words, different purchase dates and prices have given us vastly different asset values and amortization charges for two pieces of the same asset. (We repeat our usual disclaimer: we have no better accounting system to suggest. The problems to be dealt with are mind boggling and require arbitrary rules.)\n\nBut what are the economic realities? One reality is that the amortization charges that have been deducted as costs in the earnings statement each year since acquisition of Sees were not true economic costs. We know that because Sees last year earned $13 million after taxes on about $20 million of net tangible assets a performance indicating the existence of economic Goodwill far larger than the total original cost of our accounting Goodwill. In other words, while accounting Goodwill regularly decreased from the moment of purchase, economic Goodwill increased in irregular but very substantial fashion.",

It is possible, of course, that Sees economic Goodwill will disappear. But it wont shrink in even decrements or anything remotely resembling them. What is more likely is that the Goodwill will\nincrease\nin current, if not in constant, dollars because of inflation.\n\nThat probability exists because true economic Goodwill tends to rise in nominal value proportionally with inflation. To illustrate how this works, lets contrast a Sees kind of business with a more mundane business. When we purchased Sees in 1972, it will be recalled, it was earning about $2 million on $8 million of net tangible assets. Let us assume that our hypothetical mundane business then had $2 million of earnings also, but needed $18 million in net tangible assets for normal operations. Earning only 11% on required tangible assets, that mundane business would possess little or no economic Goodwill.\n\nA business like that, therefore, might well have sold for the value of its net tangible assets, or for $18 million. In contrast, we paid $25 million for Sees, even though it had no more in earnings and less than half as much in \"honest-to-God\" assets. Could less really have been more, as our purchase price implied? The answer is \"yes\"\neven if both businesses were expected to have flat unit volume\nas long as you anticipated, as we did in 1972, a world of continuous inflation.\n\nTo understand why, imagine the effect that a doubling of the price level would subsequently have on the two businesses. Both would need to double their nominal earnings to $4 million to keep themselves even with inflation. This would seem to be no great trick: just sell the same number of units at double earlier prices and, assuming profit margins remain unchanged, profits also must double.\n\nBut, crucially, to bring that about, both businesses probably would have to double their nominal investment in net tangible assets, since that is the kind of economic requirement that inflation usually imposes on businesses, both good and bad. A doubling of dollar sales means correspondingly more dollars must be employed immediately in receivables and inventories. Dollars employed in fixed assets will respond more slowly to inflation, but probably just as surely. And all of this inflation-required investment will produce no improvement in rate of return. The motivation for this investment is the survival of the business, not the prosperity of the owner.\n\nRemember, however, that Sees had net tangible assets of only $8 million. So it would only have had to commit an additional $8 million to finance the capital needs imposed by inflation. The mundane business, meanwhile, had a burden over twice as large a need for $18 million of additional capital.\n\nAfter the dust had settled, the mundane business, now earning $4 million annually, might still be worth the value of its tangible assets, or $36 million. That means its owners would have gained only a dollar of nominal value for every new dollar invested. (This is the same dollar-for-dollar result they would have achieved if they had added money to a savings account.)\n\nSees, however, also earning $4 million, might be worth $50 million if valued (as it logically would be) on the same basis as it was at the time of our purchase. So it would have gained $25 million in nominal value while the owners were putting up only $8 million in additional capital over $3 of nominal value gained for each $1 invested.\n\nRemember, even so, that the owners of the Sees kind of business were forced by inflation to ante up $8 million in additional capital just to stay even in real profits. Any unleveraged business that requires some net tangible assets to operate (and almost all do) is hurt by inflation. Businesses needing little in the way of tangible assets simply are hurt the least.\n\nAnd that fact, of course, has been hard for many people to grasp. For years the traditional wisdom long on tradition, short on wisdom held that inflation protection was best provided by businesses laden with natural resources, plants and machinery, or other tangible assets (\"In Goods We Trust\"). It doesnt work that way. Asset-heavy businesses generally earn low rates of return rates that often barely provide enough capital to fund the inflationary needs of the existing business, with nothing left over for real growth, for distribution to owners, or for acquisition of new businesses.\n\nIn contrast, a disproportionate number of the great business fortunes built up during the inflationary years arose from ownership of operations that combined intangibles of lasting value with relatively minor requirements for tangible assets. In such cases earnings have bounded upward in nominal dollars, and these dollars have been largely available for the acquisition of additional businesses. This phenomenon has been particularly evident in the communications business. That business has required little in the way of tangible investment yet its franchises have endured. During inflation, Goodwill is the gift that keeps giving.\n\nBut that statement applies, naturally, only to true economic Goodwill. Spurious accounting Goodwill and there is plenty of it around is another matter. When an overexcited management purchases a business at a silly price, the same accounting niceties described earlier are observed. Because it cant go anywhere else, the silliness ends up in the Goodwill account. Considering the lack of managerial discipline that created the account, under such circumstances it might better be labeled \"No-Will\". Whatever the term, the 40-year ritual typically is observed and the adrenalin so capitalized remains on the books as an \"asset\" just as if the acquisition had been a sensible one.\n\n",

It is also the best guide to the current value of the operations economic Goodwill.\n\nIn evaluating the wisdom of business acquisitions, amortization charges should be ignored also. They should be deducted neither from earnings nor from the cost of the business. This means forever viewing purchased Goodwill at its full cost, before any amortization. Furthermore, cost should be defined as including the full intrinsic business value not just the recorded accounting value of all consideration given, irrespective of market prices of the securities involved at the time of merger and irrespective of whether pooling treatment was allowed. For example, what we truly paid in the Blue Chip merger for 40% of the Goodwill of Sees and the News was considerably more than the $51.7 million entered on our books. This disparity exists because the market value of the Berkshire shares given up in the merger was less than their intrinsic business value, which is the value that defines the true cost to us.\n\nOperations that appear to be winners based upon perspective (1) may pale when viewed from perspective (2). A good business is not always a good purchase although its a good place to look for one.\n\nWe will try to acquire businesses that have excellent operating economics measured by (1) and that provide reasonable returns measured by (2).
