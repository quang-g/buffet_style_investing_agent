    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called\n“GAAP”). The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from an\nimpairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realized\ncapital gains from the sale of investment securities and a $20.6 billion loss from a reduction in the amount of unrealized\ncapital gains that existed in our investment holdings.\nA new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report,\nneither Berkshire’s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us have\nconsistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as “wild and\ncapricious swings in our bottom line.”\nThe accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourth\nquarters, we reported GAAP losses of $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters, we\nreported profits of $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses that\nBerkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in all quarters. For the year, those earnings\nexceeded their 2016 high of $17.6 billion by 41%.\nWide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That’s because our huge equity\nportfolio – valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 – will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2\nbillion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourth\nquarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a “profit” or “loss” of more than\n$4 billion.\nOur advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying\nthat in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them to\ndeliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLong-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. For\nnearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire’s per-share book value. It’s\nnow time to abandon that practice.\nThe fact is that the annual change in Berkshire’s book value – which makes its farewell appearance on page\n2 – is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire has\ngradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major value\nresides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, while\nour equity holdings are valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be\nincluded in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third, it\nis likely that – over time – Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place at\nprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Each\ntransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causes\nthe book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nIn future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire’s market price. Markets can be\nextremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire’s stock price\nwill provide the best measure of business performance.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBefore moving on, I want to give you some good news – really good news – that is not reflected in our\nfinancial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in charge\nof all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue.\nBerkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents,\nand Berkshire blood flows through their veins.\nNow let’s take a look at what you own.",
    "contextual_summary": "Buffett explains why Berkshire’s 2018 GAAP earnings are distorted by a new rule forcing unrealized equity gains/losses through the income statement, producing large quarterly swings. He urges shareholders to focus on operating earnings instead. He also announces he will stop using per-share book value change as the headline metric, arguing it has become increasingly misleading relative to intrinsic value, especially with more operating businesses and potential share repurchases.",

    "content": "Focus on the Forest – Forget the Trees\nInvestors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses – our\neconomic “trees,” so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array of\nspecimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade from\nnow. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty.\nFortunately, it’s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire’s\nintrinsic business value. That’s because our forest contains five “groves” of major importance, each of which can be\nappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses and\nfinancial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth – our huge and diverse insurance operation – delivers great value\nto Berkshire in a less obvious manner, one I will explain later in this letter.\nBefore we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deployment\nof your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part, that possess favorable and durable economic\ncharacteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.\nSometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes we\nseek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Our two-pronged approach to\nhuge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and, at times, gives us an important advantage.\nIn recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for\nour money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43\nbillion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in which\nwe invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.\nDespite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire’s forest remains the\nmany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with less\nthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year. When we say “earned,” moreover, we are describing what\nremains after all income taxes, interest payments, managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based),\nrestructuring expenses, depreciation, amortization and home-office overhead.\nThat brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs.\nToo often, their presentations feature “adjusted EBITDA,” a measure that redefines “earnings” to exclude a variety of\nall-too-real costs.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nFor example, managements sometimes assert that their company’s stock-based compensation shouldn’t be\ncounted as an expense. (What else could it be – a gift from shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe\nlast year’s exact rearrangement won’t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business –\nBerkshire has gone down that road dozens of times, and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.\nAbraham Lincoln once posed the question: “If you call a dog’s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?” and\nthen answered his own query: “Four, because calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it one.” Abe would have felt lonely on\nWall Street.\nCharlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of $1.4 billion (detailed on page\nK-84) are not a true economic cost. We add back such amortization “costs” to GAAP earnings when we are evaluating\nboth private businesses and marketable stocks.\nIn contrast, Berkshire’s $8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact, we need\nto spend more than this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations. Beyond those\n“maintenance” capital expenditures, we spend large sums in pursuit of growth. Overall, Berkshire invested a record\n$14.5 billion last year in plant, equipment and other fixed assets, with 89% of that spent in America.",
    "contextual_summary": "Buffett asks investors to assess Berkshire like a forest: focus on five major 'groves' rather than countless individual 'trees'. He describes Berkshire’s two-pronged capital allocation—buying whole businesses when priced sensibly, but more often buying 5–10% stakes in public companies when they offer better value. He emphasizes using realistic earnings measures, pushing back on 'adjusted EBITDA' and arguing that true maintenance and growth capital needs matter more than accounting add-backs.",

    "content": "Berkshire’s runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities, typically involving a 5% to 10% ownership\nposition in a very large company. As noted earlier, our equity investments were worth nearly $173 billion at yearend,\nan amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its yearend valuation, federal income tax of about\n$14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain. In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.\nEventually, however, gains generate taxes at whatever rate prevails at the time of sale.\nOur investees paid us dividends of $3.8 billion last year, a sum that will increase in 2019. Far more important\nthan the dividends, though, are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies. Consider, as an\nindicator, these figures that cover only our five largest holdings.\nYearend Berkshire’s Share in $ millions of\nCompany Ownership Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 17.9% $ 237 $ 997\nApple 5.4% 745 2,502\nBank of America 9.5% 551 2,096\nCoca-Cola 9.4% 624 (21)\nWells Fargo 9.8% 809 1,263\nTotal $2,966 $6,837\n(1) Based on current annual rate.\n(2) Based on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.\nGAAP – which dictates the earnings we report – does not allow us to include the retained earnings of\ninvestees in our financial accounts.

We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee’s stock is underpriced, we rejoice\nwhen management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire’s ownership percentage.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nHere’s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire’s holdings of American Express have remained\nunchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because of\nrepurchases made by the company. Last year, Berkshire’s portion of the $6.9 billion earned by American Express was\n$1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company.

Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses – 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% of\nBerkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J – totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018.\nIn our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U. S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,\nand another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to be\nuntouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.\nWe have also promised to avoid any activities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.\nBerkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes of\ncommission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, our\nstock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.\nIn the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will\npermanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businesses\npossessing decent long-term prospects.\nThat disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable\nequities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 – I’m the\nyoung one – that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie’s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a\nhuge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)\nMy expectation of more stock purchases is not a market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will\nbehave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities. Our thinking, rather,\nis focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI believe Berkshire’s intrinsic value can be approximated by summing the values of our four asset-laden\ngroves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.\nYou may ask whether an allowance should not also be made for the major tax costs Berkshire would incur if\nwe were to sell certain of our wholly-owned businesses. Forget that thought: It would be foolish for us to sell any of\nour wonderful companies even if no tax would be payable on its sale. Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard to\nfind. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all.\nThe interest cost on all of our debt has been deducted as an expense in calculating the earnings at Berkshire’s\nnon-insurance businesses. Beyond that, much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed by funds generated\nfrom Berkshire’s fifth grove – a collection of exceptional insurance companies. We call those funds “float,” a source\nof financing that we expect to be cost-free – or maybe even better than that – over time. We will explain the\ncharacteristics of float later in this letter.\nFinally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire’s value is maximized by our having assembled the\nfive groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts of\ncapital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantage\nof tax efficiencies, and minimize overhead.\nAt Berkshire, the whole is greater – considerably greater – than the sum of the parts.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",
    "contextual_summary": "Buffett completes his 'five groves' framework by describing Berkshire’s joint-venture holdings and its large liquidity reserves. He reiterates a 'financial fortress' policy—keeping at least $20B in cash equivalents—and notes that high acquisition prices make large deals hard. He proposes a practical intrinsic value approach: value the asset-heavy groves, subtract eventual taxes on marketable securities, and recognize that combining all groves into one company increases value through flexibility, lower risk, and capital-allocation advantages.",

    "content": "Repurchases and Reporting\nEarlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that we\nbuy at a discount to Berkshire’s intrinsic value – which certainly will be our intention – repurchases will benefit both\nthose shareholders leaving the company and those who stay.\nTrue, the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That’s because careful buying by\nus will minimize any impact on Berkshire’s stock price. Nevertheless, there is some benefit to sellers in having an\nextra buyer in the market.\nFor continuing shareholders, the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner’s interest at,\nsay, 90¢ on the dollar, continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase by\nthe company. Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is valuedestructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs.\nWhen a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it’s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the\ninformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try to\ndo in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled or\ninadequately informed.\nSome sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investments\nthat they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There are\nunquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.\nIn addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it’s time for them or their families to become net\nconsumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group. Perhaps\nwe will become big spenders in our old age.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFor 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholders\nwho are staying, not those who are leaving. Consequently, Charlie and I have never focused on current-quarter results.\nBerkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reports\nor balance sheets. I, of course, regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and I\nlearn of Berkshire’s overall earnings and financial position only on a quarterly basis.\nFurthermore, Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Our\nlack of such an instrument means that the parent company has never had a quarterly “number” to hit. Shunning the\nuse of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers, reinforcing the culture we prize.\nOver the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,\ninduced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations. What starts as an “innocent” fudge in order to\nnot disappoint “the Street” – say, trade-loading at quarter-end, turning a blind eye to rising insurance losses, or drawing\ndown a “cookie-jar” reserve – can become the first step toward full-fledged fraud. Playing with the numbers “just this\nonce” may well be the CEO’s intent; it’s seldom the end result. And if it’s okay for the boss to cheat a little, it’s easy\nfor subordinates to rationalize similar behavior.\nAt Berkshire, our audience is neither analysts nor commentators: Charlie and I are working for our\nshareholder-partners. The numbers that flow up to us will be the ones we send on to you.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

He emphasizes Berkshire’s long-term culture: no obsession with quarterly targets, no company-wide budget, and minimal internal pressure to 'hit the number'. He argues that short-term target pressure can lead from small manipulations to serious fraud.",

    "content": "Non-Insurance Operations – From Lollipops to Locomotives\nLet’s now look further at Berkshire’s most valuable grove – our collection of non-insurance businesses –\nkeeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them.\nAdditional details about individual operations can be found on pages K-5 – K-22 and pages K-40 – K-51.\nViewed as a group, these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of $20.8 billion, a 24% increase over\n2017. Acquisitions we made in 2018 delivered only a trivial amount of that gain.\nI will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses was\nfar greater – 47% – thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning of\nthat year. Let’s look at why the impact was so dramatic.\nBegin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U. S. Government “owns” an interest in Berkshire’s\nearnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country’s Treasury Department holds a special class of our\nstock – call this holding the AA shares – that receives large “dividends” (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In\n2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very well\nwith its AA shares. Indeed, the Treasury’s “stock,” which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965, had evolved\ninto a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.\nLast year, however, 40% of the government’s “ownership” (14/35 ths) was returned to Berkshire – free of\ncharge – when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our “A” and “B” shareholders received a\nmajor boost in the earnings attributable to their shares.\nThis happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The same\ndynamic, moreover, enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.\nThose are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the tax\nbenefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicable\nto the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate has\nlong been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however,\nthe new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerably more valuable.\nWhich suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses. Our two towering redwoods\nin this grove are BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (90.9% owned). Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before tax\nlast year, up 6% from 2017. You can read more about these businesses on pages K-5 – K-10 and pages K-40 – K-45.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate pre-tax income in 2018\nof $6.4 billion, up from the $5.5 billion these companies earned in 2017.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, Mi Tek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.4\nbillion pre-tax last year, up from $2.1 billion in 2017.\nThe remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – had pre-tax income of\n$3.6 billion in 2018 vs. $3.3 billion in 2017.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Insurance, “Float,” and the Funding of Berkshire\nOur property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business – our fifth grove – has been the engine propelling\nBerkshire’s growth since 1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &\nMarine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured\nby net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severe\nworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\nThis collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual\npolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to\npremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it has grown, as the following\ntable shows:\nYear Float (in millions)*\n1970 $ 39\n1980 237\n1990 1,632\n2000 27,871\n2010 65,832\n2018 122,732\n* Includes float arising from life, annuity and health insurance businesses.\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual – at the outside no more\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or nearterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key\ncomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the\nuse of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry,\ndespite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on\ntangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\nNevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire’s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibility\nin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are always\nan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities. When other insurers are constrained, our choices expand.\nMoreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was $3.2 billion. For\nthe entire 16-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27 billion, of which $2 billion was recorded in 2018.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.\nAt Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.",

He shows float’s long-term growth and emphasizes Berkshire’s commitment to exceptional financial strength and liability structures that avoid sudden cash calls. He also stresses that float is only a blessing with disciplined underwriting, citing Berkshire’s strong long-term underwriting profitability.",

    "content": "* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn most cases, the funding of a business comes from two sources – debt and equity. At Berkshire, we have\ntwo additional arrows in the quiver to talk about, but let’s first address the conventional components.\nWe use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing that\nsignificant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right most of the time.\nAt rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russianroulette equation – usually win, occasionally die – may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a\ncompany’s upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rational\npeople don’t risk what they have and need for what they don’t have and don’t need.\nMost of the debt you see on our consolidated balance sheet – see page K-65 – resides at our railroad and\nenergy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions, the cash generation of these businesses\nremains bountiful. The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and not guaranteed by Berkshire.\nOur level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire’s $349 billion is unmatched in corporate America. By\nretaining all earnings for a very long time, and allowing compound interest to work its magic, we have amassed funds\nthat have enabled us to purchase and develop the valuable groves earlier described. Had we instead followed a 100%\npayout policy, we would still be working with the $22 million with which we began fiscal 1965.\nBeyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources of\ncorporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge net\nliability on our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That’s because they\nhave usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paid in most years for holding and\nusing other people’s money.\nAs I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes in\nassessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that\nwill dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The\nBig One” may come from a traditional source, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving,\nsay, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a megacatastrophe strikes, we will get our share of the losses and they will be big – very big. Unlike many other insurers,\nhowever, we will be looking to add business the next day.\nThe final funding source – which again Berkshire possesses to an unusual degree – is deferred income taxes.\nThese are liabilities that we will eventually pay but that are meanwhile interest-free.\nAs I indicated earlier, about $14.7 billion of our $50.5 billion of deferred taxes arises from the unrealized\ngains in our equity holdings. These liabilities are accrued in our financial statements at the current 21% corporate tax\nrate but will be paid at the rates prevailing when our investments are sold.

    "contextual_summary": "Buffett explains Berkshire’s conservative approach to financing: minimal parent-level risk, sparing use of debt (mostly within asset-heavy subsidiaries), and massive retained earnings that built a large equity base. He then highlights two additional funding sources: insurance float (often effectively cost-free when underwriting is profitable) and deferred taxes, which behave like interest-free financing. He warns that underwriting mistakes and mega-catastrophes—including unexpected sources like cyber attacks—are inevitable over time, and Berkshire is structured to absorb them and still expand when others are constrained.",

    "content": "GEICO and Tony Nicely\nThat title says it all: The company and the man are inseparable.\nTony joined GEICO in 1961 at the age of 18; I met him in the mid-1970 s. At that time, GEICO, after a fourdecade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. A\nrecently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO’s loss costs and consequently underpriced its\nproduct. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO’s books – there were no less than\n2.3 million of them – would expire and could then be repriced. The company’s net worth in the meantime was rapidly\napproaching zero.\nIn 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concluded\nthat he was the perfect man for the job, and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months, Berkshire\n⁄ ⁄\nbought about 1 of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly 1 without our spending a dime. That stunning\n3 2\naccretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares. All told, this halfinterest in GEICO cost Berkshire $47 million, about what you might pay today for a trophy apartment in New York.\nLet’s now fast-forward 17 years to 1993, when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point, GEICO’s\nreputation and profitability had been restored – but not its growth. Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9\nmillion auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U. S. auto insurers, GEICO\nthen ranked an undistinguished seventh.\nLate in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of the\ncompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!). Our\noffer was successful and brought Berkshire a wonderful, but underdeveloped, company and an equally wonderful\nCEO, who would move GEICO forward beyond my dreams.\nGEICO is now America’s Number Two auto insurer, with sales 1,200% greater than it recorded in 1995.\nUnderwriting profits have totaled $15.5 billion (pre-tax) since our purchase, and float available for investment has\ngrown from $2.5 billion to $22.1 billion.\nBy my estimate, Tony’s management of GEICO has increased Berkshire’s intrinsic value by more than $50\nbillion. On top of that, he is a model for everything a manager should be, helping his 40,000 associates to identify and\npolish abilities they didn’t realize they possessed.\nLast year, Tony decided to retire as CEO, and on June 30 th he turned that position over to Bill Roberts, his\nlong-time partner. I’ve known and watched Bill operate for several decades, and once again Tony made the right\nmove. Tony remains Chairman and will be helpful to GEICO for the rest of his life. He’s incapable of doing less.\nAll Berkshire shareholders owe Tony their thanks. I head the list.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",
    "contextual_summary": "Buffett tells the intertwined story of GEICO and CEO Tony Nicely: a near-bankruptcy caused by mispriced risk, a successful rescue under Jack Byrne, and Berkshire’s growing ownership aided by GEICO buybacks. He credits Tony’s tenure with transforming GEICO into the #2 U.S. auto insurer, producing large underwriting profits and expanding float. Buffett notes Tony’s retirement from the CEO role, his succession choice (Bill Roberts), and expresses gratitude for the value created for Berkshire shareholders.",

    "content": "The American Tailwind\nOn March 11 th, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business. The year was 1942, I was\n11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six. What I bought was three shares of Cities\nService preferred stock. I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.\nLet’s now travel back through the two 77-year periods that preceded my purchase. That leaves us starting in\n1788, a year prior to George Washington’s installation as our first president. Could anyone then have imagined what\ntheir new country would accomplish in only three 77-year lifetimes?\nDuring the two 77-year periods prior to 1942, the United States had grown from four million people – about\n⁄\n1 of 1% of the world’s population – into the most powerful country on earth. In that spring of 1942, though, it faced\na crisis: The U. S. and its allies were suffering heavy losses in a war that we had entered only three months earlier. Bad\nnews arrived daily.\nDespite the alarming headlines, almost all Americans believed on that March 11 th that the war would be\nwon. Nor was their optimism limited to that victory. Leaving aside congenital pessimists, Americans believed that\ntheir children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led.\nThe nation’s citizens understood, of course, that the road ahead would not be a smooth ride. It never had\nbeen. Early in its history our country was tested by a Civil War that killed 4% of all American males and led President\nLincoln to openly ponder whether “a nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure.” In the 1930 s, America\nsuffered through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.\nNevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that proved\nto be well-founded. In fact, the nation’s achievements can best be described as breathtaking.\nLet’s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and all\ndividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31,2019 (the\nlatest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment\nby a tax-free institution of that time – say, a pension fund or college endowment – would have grown to about $5.3\nbillion.\nLet me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid\nonly 1% of assets annually to various “helpers,” such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have\nbeen cut in half, to $2.65 billion. That’s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved\nby the S&P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nThose who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for many\nyears) might note that our country’s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.\nThat’s 40,000%! Suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and a\n⁄\nworthless currency. To “protect” yourself, you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy 31 ounces of\ngold with your $114.75.\nAnd what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,\nless than 1% of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business. The\nmagical metal was no match for the American mettle.\nOur country’s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner. Since 1942, we have\nhad seven Republican presidents and seven Democrats. In the years they served, the country contended at various times\nwith a long period of viral inflation, a 21% prime rate, several controversial and costly wars, the resignation of a\npresident, a pervasive collapse in home values, a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems. All\nengendered scary headlines; all are now history.\nChristopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral, lies buried within that London church. Near his tomb are\nposted these words of description (translated from Latin): “If you would seek my monument, look around you.” Those\nskeptical of America’s economic playbook should heed his message.\nIn 1788 – to go back to our starting point – there really wasn’t much here except for a small band of ambitious\npeople and an embryonic governing framework aimed at turning their dreams into reality. Today, the Federal Reserve\nestimates our household wealth at $108 trillion, an amount almost impossible to comprehend.\nRemember, earlier in this letter, how I described retained earnings as having been the key to Berkshire’s\nprosperity? So it has been with America. In the nation’s accounting, the comparable item is labeled “savings.” And\nsave we have. If our forefathers had instead consumed all they produced, there would have been no investment, no\nproductivity gains and no leap in living standards.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I happily acknowledge that much of Berkshire’s success has simply been a product of what I\nthink should be called The American Tailwind. It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boast\nthat they have “done it alone.” The tidy rows of simple white crosses at Normandy should shame those who make\nsuch claims.\nThere are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures. About that, we should rejoice:\nAmericans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive. At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant\nsums across borders.\nOver the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by The\nAmerican Tailwind. We are lucky – gloriously lucky – to have that force at our back.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",
    "contextual_summary": "Buffett reflects on 77 years since his first stock purchase and uses long-horizon math to illustrate the power of U.S. business compounding, especially via low-cost index investing. He highlights how even a 1% annual fee can halve long-term outcomes, and contrasts stock ownership with holding gold as a 'protection' asset. Despite wars, recessions, scandals, inflation, and deficits, he argues America’s prosperity—driven by reinvestment and innovation—has been extraordinary and remains a major tailwind for Berkshire.",
