    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2017 was $65.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 23%. Over the last 53 years (that is, since present management took over), pershare book value has grown from $19 to $211,750, a rate of 19.1% compounded annually.*\nThe format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: A\nlarge portion of our gain did not come from anything we accomplished at Berkshire.\nThe $65 billion gain is nonetheless real – rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire’s\noperations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U. S. Tax Code.\n(Details of Berkshire’s tax-related gain appear on page K-32 and pages K-89 – K-90.)\nAfter stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire’s operations. But,\nin still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule – a generally accepted accounting\nprinciple (GAAP) – that in future quarterly and annual reports will severely distort Berkshire’s net income figures and\nvery often mislead commentators and investors.\nThe new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be\nincluded in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capricious\nswings in our GAAP bottom-line. Berkshire owns $170 billion of marketable stocks (not including our shares of Kraft\nHeinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period.\nIncluding gyrations of that magnitude in reported net income will swamp the truly important numbers that describe our\noperating performance. For analytical purposes, Berkshire’s “bottom-line” will be useless.\nThe new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realized gains\n(or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases,\nwe have regularly warned you not to pay attention to these realized gains, because they – just like our unrealized gains\n• fluctuate randomly.\nThat’s largely because we sell securities when that seems the intelligent thing to do, not because we are trying\nto influence earnings in any way. As a result, we sometimes have reported substantial realized gains for a period when\nour portfolio, overall, performed poorly (or the converse).\n*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500 th of those\nshown for the A shares.\n\nWith the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying to\nrealized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of our\nnumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaper\nheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reports\nsometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.\nWe will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late on\nFriday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysis\nand give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday.\nNevertheless, I expect considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.\nAt Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is what\nCharlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I focus on – and we hope that you do, too. Our scorecard for 2017 follows.",

    "content": "Acquisitions\nThere are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-on\nacquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our many\nand varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, we\nwill review 2017 acquisition activity.\nIn our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths;\nable and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business;\nopportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price.\nThat last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far\nfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic\npurchasers.\nWhy the purchasing frenzy? In part, it’s because the CEO job self-selects for “can-do” types. If Wall Street\nanalysts or board members urge that brand of CEO to consider possible acquisitions, it’s a bit like telling your ripening\nteenager to be sure to have a normal sex life.\nOnce a CEO hungers for a deal, he or she will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinates\nwill be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporate\nsize. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a\nhaircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large “synergies” will be\nforecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.\nThe ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, even\na high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluate\nacquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low and that to assign a large portion\nof our debt to any individual business would generally be fallacious (leaving aside certain exceptions, such as debt\ndedicated to Clayton’s lending portfolio or to the fixed-asset commitments at our regulated utilities). We also never\nfactor in, nor do we often find, synergies.\nOur aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us\nbelieve it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need. We held this view 50 years\nago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also hold\nit today after a million or so “partners” have joined us at Berkshire.\n\nDespite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have\nopportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the\nprudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe were able to make one sensible stand-alone purchase last year, a 38.6% partnership interest in Pilot Flying\nJ (“PFJ”). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation’s leading travel-center\noperator.\nPFJ has been run from the get-go by the remarkable Haslam family. “Big Jim” Haslam began with a dream\nand a gas station 60 years ago. Now his son, Jimmy, manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughout\nNorth America. Berkshire has a contractual agreement to increase its partnership interest in PFJ to 80% in 2023;\nHaslam family members will then own the remaining 20%. Berkshire is delighted to be their partner.\nWhen driving on the Interstate, drop in. PFJ sells gasoline as well as diesel fuel, and the food is good. If it’s\nbeen a long day, remember, too, that our properties have 5,200 showers.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLet’s move now to bolt-on acquisitions. Some of these were small transactions that I will not detail. Here is\nan account, however, of a few larger purchases whose closings stretched between late 2016 and early 2018.\nŠ Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubled\nour presence in a field we entered only three years ago. With these additions – Oakwood Homes in Colorado and\nHarris Doyle in Birmingham – I expect our 2018 site built volume will exceed $1 billion.\nClayton’s emphasis, nonetheless, remains manufactured homes, both their construction and their financing.\nIn 2017 Clayton sold 19,168 units through its own retail operation and wholesaled another 26,706 units to independent\nretailers. All told, Clayton accounted for 49% of the manufactured-home market last year. That industry-leading share\n• about three times what our nearest competitor did – is a far cry from the 13% Clayton achieved in 2003, the year it\njoined Berkshire.\nBoth Clayton Homes and PFJ are based in Knoxville, where the Clayton and Haslam families have long been\nfriends. Kevin Clayton’s comments to the Haslams about the advantages of a Berkshire affiliation, and his admiring\ncomments about the Haslam family to me, helped cement the PFJ deal.\nŠ Near the end of 2016, Shaw Industries, our floor coverings business, acquired U. S. Floors (“USF”), a rapidly\ngrowing distributor of luxury vinyl tile. USF’s managers, Piet Dossche and Philippe Erramuzpe, came out of the gate\nfast, delivering a 40% increase in sales in 2017, during which their operation was integrated with Shaw’s. It’s clear\nthat we acquired both great human assets and business assets in making the USF purchase.\nVance Bell, Shaw’s CEO, originated, negotiated and completed this acquisition, which increased Shaw’s\nsales to $5.7 billion in 2017 and its employment to 22,000. With the purchase of USF, Shaw has substantially\nstrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.\nŠ I have told you several times about Home Services, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshire\nbacked into this business in 2000 when we acquired a majority interest in Mid American Energy (now named Berkshire\nHathaway Energy). Mid American’s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid little\nattention to Home Services.\n\nBut, year-by-year, the company added brokers and, by the end of 2016, Home Services was the second-largest\nbrokerage operation in the country – still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however,\nHome Services’ growth exploded. We acquired the industry’s third-largest operator, Long and Foster; number 12,\nHoulihan Lawrence; and Gloria Nilson.\nWith those purchases we added 12,300 agents, raising our total to 40,950. Home Services is now close to\nleading the country in home sales, having participated (including our three acquisitions pro-forma) in $127 billion of\n“sides” during 2017. To explain that term, there are two “sides” to every transaction; if we represent both buyer and\nseller, the dollar value of the transaction is counted twice.\nDespite its recent acquisitions, Home Services is on track to do only about 3% of the country’s homebrokerage business in 2018. That leaves 97% to go. Given sensible prices, we will keep adding brokers in this most\nfundamental of businesses.\nŠ Finally, Precision Castparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz Gmb H, a\nGerman maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components. Please allow me to skip a further\nexplanation. I don’t understand manufacturing operations as well as I do the activities of real estate brokers, home\nbuilders or truck stops.\nFortunately, I don’t need in this instance to bring knowledge to the table: Mark Donegan, CEO of Precision,\nis an extraordinary manufacturing executive, and any business in his domain is slated to do well. Betting on people\ncan sometimes be more certain than betting on physical assets.\nLet’s now move on to operations, beginning with property-casualty (“p/c”) insurance, a business I do\nunderstand and the engine that for 51 years has powered Berkshire’s growth.",

    "content": "Insurance\nBefore I discuss our 2017 insurance results, let me remind you of how and why we entered the field. We\nbegan by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With our\npurchase we received $6.7 million of tangible net worth that, by the nature of the insurance business, we were able to\ndeploy in marketable securities. It was easy to rearrange the portfolio into securities we would otherwise have owned at\nBerkshire itself. In effect, we were “trading dollars” for the net worth portion of the cost.\nThe $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usually\ndelivered an underwriting profit. Even more important, the insurance operation carried with it $19.4 million of “float”\n• money that belonged to others but was held by our two insurers.\nEver since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,\ninterest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course,\nare on our tab as well.)\nFloat materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfront\nwhereas losses occur over the life of the policy, usually a six-month or one-year period; (2) Though some losses, such\nas car repairs, are quickly paid, others – such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos – may take many years to\nsurface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, of\na person employed by one of our workers’ compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafter\nrequiring expensive lifetime care.\n\nFloat generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines of\nbusiness such as medical malpractice or product liability – business labeled “long-tail” in industry jargon – that\ngenerate far more float than, say, auto collision and homeowner policies, which require insurers to almost immediately\nmake payments to claimants for needed repairs.\nBerkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumbo\nreinsurance policies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of our\nemphasizing that sort of business, Berkshire’s growth in float has been extraordinary. We are now the country’s second\nlargest p/c company measured by premium volume and its leader, by far, in float.\nHere’s the record:\n(in $ millions)\nYear Premium Volume Float\n1970 $ 39 $ 39\n1980 185 237\n1990 582 1,632\n2000 19,343 27,871\n2010 30,749 65,832\n2017 60,597 114,500\nOur 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses that\nAIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world’s record and one we won’t come close to\nrepeating. Premium volume will therefore fall somewhat in 2018.\nFloat will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we eventually experience a decline, it will\nbe modest – at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrender\noptions, p/c float can’t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can’t experience massive “runs” in times of\nwidespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investment\ndecisions.\nCharlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers – or even\nthat of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked having\nTreasury Bills – loads of Treasury Bills – that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines\nor commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortably\nwithstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe downside of float is that it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. What looks predictable in insurance\ncan be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. In\nthe 1980’s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time,\nthreatened to destroy its storied operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)\nBerkshire’s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has\nlong prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in such\ninstances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paid then for holding the huge sums tallied in the\nearlier table.\nI have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light period\nthe industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significant\nhurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nMy guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure,\nhowever, could be far off the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ran\nlow. As well-known analyst V. J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-graded\nexam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer’s\nfinancial condition for a very long time.\nWe currently estimate Berkshire’s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion after\ntax). If both that estimate and my industry estimate of $100 billion are close to accurate, our share of the industry loss\nwas about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in future\nAmerican mega-cats.\nIt’s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire’s GAAP net worth\nby less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worth\nranging from 7% to more than 15%. The damage to them could have been far worse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a\npath through Florida only a bit to the east, insured losses might well have been an additional $100 billion.\nWe believe that the annual probability of a U. S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insured\nlosses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increases\nover time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.\nNo company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our share\nof such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insurance\nactivities. Concurrently, much – indeed, perhaps most – of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleled\nfinancial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire – and only Berkshire – when they, themselves,\nneed to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.\nPrior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3\nbillion pre-tax. I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years,\nbut also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pre-tax from\nunderwriting.\nA large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K at\nthe back of this report. The only point I will add here is that you have some extraordinary managers working for you\nat our various p/c operations. This is a business in which there are no trade secrets, patents, or locational advantages.\nWhat counts are brains and capital. The managers of our various insurance companies supply the brains and Berkshire\nprovides the capital.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFor many years, this letter has described the activities of Berkshire’s many other businesses. That discussion\nhas become both repetitious and partially duplicative of information regularly included in the 10-K that follows the\nletter. Consequently, this year I will give you a simple summary of our dozens of non-insurance businesses. Additional\ndetails can be found on pages K-5 – K-22 and pages K-40 – K-50.\nViewed as a group – and excluding investment income – our operations other than insurance delivered pretax income of $20 billion in 2017, an increase of $950 million over 2016. About 44% of the 2017 profit came from two\nsubsidiaries. BNSF, our railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (of which we own 90.2%). You can read more\nabout these businesses on pages K-5 – K-10 and pages K-40 – K-44.\nProceeding down Berkshire’s long list of subsidiaries, our next five non-insurance businesses, as ranked by\nearnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes, International Metalworking Companies, Lubrizol,\nMarmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2017 of $5.5 billion, little changed from the $5.4\nbillion these companies earned in 2016.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, Mi Tek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.1\nbillion last year, up from $1.7 billion in 2016.\n\nThe remaining businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – recorded little change in pre-tax\nincome, which was $3.7 billion in 2017 versus $3.5 billion in 2016.\nDepreciation charges for all of these non-insurance operations totaled $7.6 billion; capital expenditures were\n$11.5 billion. Berkshire is always looking for ways to expand its businesses and regularly incurs capital expenditures\nthat far exceed its depreciation charge. Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America’s\neconomic soil remains fertile.\nAmortization charges were an additional $1.3 billion. I believe that in large part this item is not a true\neconomic cost. Partially offsetting this good news is the fact that BNSF (like all other railroads) records depreciation\ncharges that fall well short of the sums regularly needed to keep the railroad in first-class shape.\nBerkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we\nwill need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At yearend Berkshire held\n$116.0 billion in cash and U. S. Treasury Bills (whose average maturity was 88 days), up from $86.4 billion at yearend\n2016. This extraordinary liquidity earns only a pittance and is far beyond the level Charlie and I wish Berkshire to\nhave.

Each, independently of me, manages more than $12 billion; I usually learn\nabout decisions they have made by looking at monthly portfolio summaries. Included in the $25 billion that the two\nmanage is more than $8 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pension investments\nare not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker\nsymbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of media\npundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be)\nour investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash register\nwill ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall – and over time – we should get decent\nresults. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.\nFrom our stock portfolio – call our holdings “minority interests” in a diversified group of publicly-owned\nbusinesses – Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That’s the number included in our GAAP figures,\nas well as in the “operating earnings” we reference in our quarterly and annual reports.\nThat dividend figure, however, far understates the “true” earnings emanating from our stock holdings. For\ndecades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our “Owner-Related Business Principles” (page 19) that we expect\nundistributed earnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings by way of subsequent capital gains.\nOur recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAP\nrule requiring us to constantly record unrealized gains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the\nearnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate into\ncommensurate capital gains for Berkshire.\nThe connection of value-building to retained earnings that I’ve just described will be impossible to detect in\nthe short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value.\nOver time, however, Ben Graham’s oft-quoted maxim proves true: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine;\nin the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire, itself, provides some vivid examples of how price randomness in the short term can obscure longterm growth in value. For the last 53 years, the company has built value by reinvesting its earnings and letting\ncompound interest work its magic. Year by year, we have moved forward. Yet Berkshire shares have suffered four\ntruly major dips. Here are the gory details:\nPeriod High Low Percentage Decrease\nMarch 1973-January 1975 93 38 (59.1%)\n10/2/87-10/27/87 4,250 2,675 (37.1%)\n6/19/98-3/10/2000 80,900 41,300 (48.9%)\n9/19/08-3/5/09 147,000 72,400 (50.7%)\nThis table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks.\nThere is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and your\npositions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines\nand breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.\n\nIn the next 53 years our shares (and others) will experience declines resembling those in the table. No one\ncan tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow.\nWhen major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped\nby debt. That’s the time to heed these lines from Kipling’s If:\n“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .\nIf you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . .\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you . . .\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.”\n“The Bet” is Over and Has Delivered an Unforeseen Investment Lesson\nLast year, at the 90% mark, I gave you a detailed report on a ten-year bet I had made on December 19,2007.\n(The full discussion from last year’s annual report is reprinted on pages 24 – 26.) Now I have the final tally – and, in\nseveral respects, it’s an eye-opener.\nI made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sum\nthat – if things turned out as I expected – would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) to\npublicize my conviction that my pick – a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund – would,\nover time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded and\nincentivized those “helpers” may be.\nAddressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually to\nadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money’s\nworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anything for their outlays?\nProtégé Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five “funds-of-funds” that it expected to overperform\nthe S&P 500. That was not a small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedge\nfunds.\nEssentially, Protégé, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. This\nassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.\nThe managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could – and did – rearrange\ntheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new “stars” while exiting their positions in hedge\nfunds whose managers had lost their touch.\nEvery actor on Protégé’s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fund\nmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally moves\nupwards. (In 100% of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500\nexceeded loss years.)\nThose performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\nfunds lost money for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich. That would occur because\n⁄\nfixed fees averaging a staggering 21 % of assets or so were paid every year by the fund-of-funds’ investors, with part\nof these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of the\nunderlying hedge funds.",

I, however, have received their annual audits from Protégé. The 2016 figures for funds A, B\nand C were revised slightly from those originally reported last year. Fund D was liquidated in 2017; its\naverage annual gain is calculated for the nine years of its operation.\nThe five funds-of-funds got off to a fast start, each beating the index fund in 2008. Then the roof fell in. In\nevery one of the nine years that followed, the funds-of-funds as a whole trailed the index fund.\nLet me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock-market behavior over the ten-year stretch.\nIf a poll of investment “experts” had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, their\nguesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500. Making money in that\nenvironment should have been easy. Indeed, Wall Street “helpers” earned staggering sums. While this group\nprospered, however, many of their investors experienced a lost decade.\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe bet illuminated another important investment lesson: Though markets are generally rational, they\noccasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does not require great intelligence, a degree in\neconomics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is an\nability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to look\nunimaginative for a sustained period – or even to look foolish – is also essential.\nOriginally, Protégé and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000\nface amount of zero-coupon U. S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called “strips”). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 –\na bit less than 64¢ on the dollar – with the $500,000 payable in ten years.\nAs the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were\npurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity. Protégé and I originally intended to do no more than\ntally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017.\n\nAfter our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012,\nour bonds – now with about five years to go before they matured – were selling for 95.7% of their face value. At that\nprice, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, . 88%.\nGiven that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb – a really dumb – investment compared to\nAmerican equities. Over time, the S&P 500 – which mirrors a huge cross-section of American business, appropriately\nweighted by market value – has earned far more than 10% annually on shareholders’ equity (net worth).\n⁄\nIn November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cash return from dividends on the S&P 500 was 21 %\nannually, about triple the yield on our U. S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow.\nBeyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use their\nretained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would,\nover time, substantially increase earnings-per-share. And – as has been the case since 1776 – whatever its problems of\nthe minute, the American economy was going to move forward.\nPresented late in 2012 with the extraordinary valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Protégé and\nI agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire “B” shares.\nThe result: Girls Inc. of Omaha found itself receiving $2,222,279 last month rather than the $1 million it had originally\nhoped for.\nBerkshire, it should be emphasized, has not performed brilliantly since the 2012 substitution. But brilliance\nwasn’t needed: After all, Berkshire’s gain only had to beat that annual . 88% bond bogey – hardly a Herculean\nachievement.\nThe only risk in the bonds-to-Berkshire switch was that yearend 2017 would coincide with an exceptionally\nweak stock market. Protégé and I felt this possibility (which always exists) was very low. Two factors dictated this\nconclusion: The reasonable price of Berkshire in late 2012, and the large asset build-up that was almost certain to occur\nat Berkshire during the five years that remained before the bet would be settled. Even so, to eliminate all risk to the\ncharities from the switch, I agreed to make up any shortfall if sales of the 11,200 Berkshire shares at yearend 2017\ndidn’t produce at least $1 million.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nInvesting is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption\nat a later date. “Risk” is the possibility that this objective won’t be attained.\nBy that standard, purportedly “risk-free” long-term bonds in 2012 were a far riskier investment than a longterm investment in common stocks. At that time, even a 1% annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 would\nhave decreased the purchasing-power of the government bond that Protégé and I sold.\nI want to quickly acknowledge that in any upcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far\nriskier – than short-term U. S. bonds. As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio\nof U. S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible\nmultiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.\nIt is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college\nendowments and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds\nto stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA final lesson from our bet: Stick with big, “easy” decisions and eschew activity. During the ten-year bet,\nthe 200-plus hedge-fund managers that were involved almost certainly made tens of thousands of buy and sell\ndecisions. Most of those managers undoubtedly thought hard about their decisions, each of which they believed would\nprove advantageous. In the process of investing, they studied 10-Ks, interviewed managements, read trade journals\nand conferred with Wall Street analysts.\n\nProtégé and I, meanwhile, leaning neither on research, insights nor brilliance, made only one investment\ndecision during the ten years. We simply decided to sell our bond investment at a price of more than 100 times earnings\n(95.7 sale price/. 88 yield), those being “earnings” that could not increase during the ensuing five years.\nWe made the sale in order to move our money into a single security – Berkshire – that, in turn, owned a\ndiversified group of solid businesses. Fueled by retained earnings, Berkshire’s growth in value was unlikely to be less\nthan 8% annually, even if we were to experience a so-so economy.\nAfter that kindergarten-like analysis, Protégé and I made the switch and relaxed, confident that, over time, 8%\nwas certain to beat . 88%.

    "content": "Major Berkshire Share Price Declines\n\nSome of the stocks in the table are the responsibility of either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who work with\nme in managing Berkshire’s investments. Each, independently of me, manages more than $12 billion; I usually learn\nabout decisions they have made by looking at monthly portfolio summaries. Included in the $25 billion that the two\nmanage is more than $8 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pension investments\nare not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker\nsymbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of media\npundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be)\nour investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash register\nwill ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall – and over time – we should get decent\nresults. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.\nFrom our stock portfolio – call our holdings “minority interests” in a diversified group of publicly-owned\nbusinesses – Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That’s the number included in our GAAP figures,\nas well as in the “operating earnings” we reference in our quarterly and annual reports.\nThat dividend figure, however, far understates the “true” earnings emanating from our stock holdings. For\ndecades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our “Owner-Related Business Principles” (page 19) that we expect\nundistributed earnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings by way of subsequent capital gains.\nOur recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAP\nrule requiring us to constantly record unrealized gains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the\nearnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate into\ncommensurate capital gains for Berkshire.\nThe connection of value-building to retained earnings that I’ve just described will be impossible to detect in\nthe short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value.\nOver time, however, Ben Graham’s oft-quoted maxim proves true: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine;\nin the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire, itself, provides some vivid examples of how price randomness in the short term can obscure longterm growth in value. For the last 53 years, the company has built value by reinvesting its earnings and letting\ncompound interest work its magic. Year by year, we have moved forward. Yet Berkshire shares have suffered four\ntruly major dips. Here are the gory details:\n\nPeriod High Low Percentage Decrease\nMarch 1973-January 1975 93 38 (59.1%)\n10/2/87-10/27/87 4,250 2,675 (37.1%)\n6/19/98-3/10/2000 80,900 41,300 (48.9%)\n9/19/08-3/5/09 147,000 72,400 (50.7%)\n\nThis table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks.\nThere is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and your\npositions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines\nand breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.",

    "content": "“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .\n\nIn the next 53 years our shares (and others) will experience declines resembling those in the table. No one\ncan tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow.\nWhen major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped\nby debt. That’s the time to heed these lines from Kipling’s If:\n\n“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .\nIf you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . .\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you . . .\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.”\n“The Bet” is Over and Has Delivered an Unforeseen Investment Lesson\nLast year, at the 90% mark, I gave you a detailed report on a ten-year bet I had made on December 19,2007.\n(The full discussion from last year’s annual report is reprinted on pages 24 – 26.) Now I have the final tally – and, in\nseveral respects, it’s an eye-opener.\nI made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sum\nthat – if things turned out as I expected – would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) to\npublicize my conviction that my pick – a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund – would,\nover time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded and\nincentivized those “helpers” may be.\nAddressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually to\nadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money’s\nworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anything for their outlays?\nProtégé Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five “funds-of-funds” that it expected to overperform\nthe S&P 500. That was not a small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedge\nfunds.\nEssentially, Protégé, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. This\nassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.\nThe managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could – and did – rearrange\ntheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new “stars” while exiting their positions in hedge\nfunds whose managers had lost their touch.\nEvery actor on Protégé’s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fund\nmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally moves\nupwards. (In 100% of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500\nexceeded loss years.)\nThose performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\nfunds lost money for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich. That would occur because\n⁄\nfixed fees averaging a staggering 21 % of assets or so were paid every year by the fund-of-funds’ investors, with part\nof these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of the\nunderlying hedge funds.",

    "content": "The Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting falls on May 5 th and will again be webcast by Yahoo!, whose web address is\nhttps://finance. yahoo. com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 8: 45 a. m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo! will\ninterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Both the\ninterviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.\nOur partnership with Yahoo! began in 2016 and shareholders have responded enthusiastically. Last year,\nreal-time viewership increased 72% to about 3.1 million and replays of short segments totaled 17.1 million.\nFor those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the Century Link will open at 7: 00 a. m. on Saturday\nto facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8: 30. The question-and-answer period will start\nat 9: 15 and run until 3: 30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3: 45 we will begin the formal shareholder\nmeeting, which usually runs from 15 to 45 minutes. Shopping will end at 4: 30.\nOn Friday, May 4 th, our Berkshire exhibitors at Century Link will be open from noon until 5 p. m. We added\nthat extra shopping time in 2015, and serious shoppers love it. Last year about 12,000 people came through the doors\nin the five hours we were open on Friday.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. (Your Chairman discourages freebies.) Say hello to the many\nBerkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that\nsalutes all of our companies.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.\nAfter you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our sixth annual “Berkshire 5 K,” an 8 a. m. race starting at the\nCentury Link. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with your\nmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers,\ndirectors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; even with Brooks running shoes, our times would be\nembarrassing.) Participation in the 5 K grows every year. Help us set another record.\nA GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from\naround the country. At last year’s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 43% from 2016.\nSo stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).\nThis special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount\nis not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of your\nexisting insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the savings on other Berkshire\nproducts.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry more than 40 books and DVDs, among\nthem a couple of new titles. Berkshire shareholders are a bookseller’s dream: When Poor Charlie’s Almanack (yes,\nour Charlie) made its debut some years ago, we sold 3,500 copies at the meeting. The book weighed 4.85 pounds. Do\n⁄\nthe math: Our shareholders left the building that day carrying about 81 tons of Charlie’s wisdom.\n\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that most airlines\nsubstantially increase prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying\n⁄\nto Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21 hours, and it may be that Kansas City can\nsave you significant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make\nyour purchases between Tuesday, May 1 st and Monday, May 7 th inclusive, and must also present your meeting\ncredential. Last year, the one-week volume for the store was a staggering $44.6 million. Bricks and mortar are alive\nand well at NFM.\nThe period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that\nnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an\nexception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend,” NFM will be open from 10 a. m. to\n9 p. m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a. m. to 8 p. m. on Sunday. From 5: 30 p. m. to 8 p. m. on Saturday, NFM is\nhosting a picnic to which you are all invited.\nNFM will again extend its shareholder’s discount offerings to our Kansas City and Dallas stores. From May\n1 st through May 7 th, shareholders who present meeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such\nas brokerage statements) to those NFM stores will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omaha\nstore.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\n6 p. m. to 9 p. m. on Friday, May 4 th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6 th, from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m.\nOn Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p. m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save (or so my daughter\ntells me when we visit the store).\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30 th through Saturday, May 12 th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing you\nown our stock.\nOn Sunday afternoon, on the upper level above Borsheims, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg,\ntwo of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders. If they suggest wagering on the game,\nchange the subject. Ajit, Charlie, Bill Gates and I will likely drop by as well.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met\nAriel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented the United States\nin the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p. m. Bill\nGates did pretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.) I\nwill participate on an advisory basis only.\nGorat’s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6 th, serving from 12 p. m. until\n10 p. m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 2 nd (but not before). Show you are a sophisticated\ndiner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.\nWe will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, asking\nCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail\naddresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed at\nloomisbrk@gmail. com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at Berkshire Questions@cnbc. com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of the\nNew York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes. com.",

    "content": "The Annual Meeting\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\nand important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you\nkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two\nquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned\nif your question is asked.)\nAn accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\ninsurance specialist will be Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insurance\noperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Since\nwhat we will be conducting is a shareholders’ meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions\nthat add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many questioners as\npossible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than when you came and\nfor you to have a good time while in Omaha.\nAll told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for\n18 from the audience. After the 54 th, all questions come from the audience. Charlie and I have often tackled more than\n60 by 3: 30.\nThe questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8: 15 a. m.\non the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will\nhost, so to speak, a drawing.\nWhile I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, should\nalso have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to\nissue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday (a\nday that also eases traffic and parking problems).\nWe do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,\ntreating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of\nlimited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the company day-to-day – and\nas I write this letter – that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars\nwho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of our\nmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most of\nour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their\npaycheck.\nIf managers (or directors) own Berkshire shares – and many do – it’s from open-market purchases they\nhave made or because they received shares when they sold their businesses to us. None, however, gets the upside of\nownership without risking the downside. Our directors and managers stand in your shoes.\nWe continue to have a wonderful group at headquarters. This team efficiently deals with a multitude of\nSEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 32,700-page Federal income tax return, oversees the filing of 3,935\nstate tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the\ncountry’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on and\non.\n\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt with\nthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also\nhandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered\nin Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help at the annual meeting in whatever\nway they are needed. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI’ve saved the best for last. Early in 2018, Berkshire’s board elected Ajit Jain and Greg Abel as directors\nof Berkshire and also designated each as Vice Chairman. Ajit is now responsible for insurance operations, and Greg\noversees the rest of our businesses. Charlie and I will focus on investments and capital allocation.\nYou and I are lucky to have Ajit and Greg working for us. Each has been with Berkshire for decades, and\nBerkshire’s blood flows through their veins. The character of each man matches his talents. And that says it all.\nCome to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – on May 5 th and meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look\nforward to your visit.\nFebruary 24,2018 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
