Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.\nIn 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.\nThree years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in\nbuying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move,\nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake.\nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a\ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose\nmoney I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that\nCharlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.\nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about\never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add\nto it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses\nat wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\nBen Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding\nI subsequently followed his instructions.\nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and,\nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he\ncontinued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with\nus, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.\nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as\nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.\nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me\ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part\nolder brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the\nreins, and when I blundered he never – never –reminded me of my mistake.\nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those\nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire\nhas become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction\ncrew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.",

I am charged with writing a\nletter every year that will be useful to this diverse and ever-changing group of owners, many of\nwhom wish to learn more about their investment.\nCharlie Munger, for decades my partner in managing Berkshire, viewed this obligation\nidentically and would expect me to communicate with you this year in the regular manner. He and\nI were of one mind regarding our responsibilities to Berkshire shareholders.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWriters find it useful to picture the reader they seek, and often they are hoping to attract a\nmass audience. At Berkshire, we have a more limited target: investors who trust Berkshire with\ntheir savings without any expectation of resale (resembling in attitude people who save in order to\nbuy a farm or rental property rather than people who prefer using their excess funds to purchase\nlottery tickets or “hot” stocks).\nOver the years, Berkshire has attracted an unusual number of such “lifetime” shareholders\nand their heirs. We cherish their presence and believe they are entitled to hear every year both the\ngood and bad news, delivered directly from their CEO and not from an investor-relations officer\nor communications consultant forever serving up optimism and syrupy mush.\nIn visualizing the owners that Berkshire seeks, I am lucky to have the perfect mental model,\nmy sister, Bertie. Let me introduce her.\nFor openers, Bertie is smart, wise and likes to challenge my thinking. We have never,\nhowever, had a shouting match or anything close to a ruptured relationship. We never will.\nFurthermore, Bertie, and her three daughters as well, have a large portion of their savings\nin Berkshire shares. Their ownership spans decades, and every year Bertie will read what I have\nto say. My job is to anticipate her questions and give her honest answers.\n\nBertie, like most of you, understands many accounting terms, but she is not ready for a\nCPA exam. She follows business news – reading four newspapers daily – but doesn’t consider\nherself an economic expert. She is sensible – very sensible – instinctively knowing that pundits\nshould always be ignored. After all, if she could reliably predict tomorrow’s winners, would she\nfreely share her valuable insights and thereby increase competitive buying? That would be like\nfinding gold and then handing a map to the neighbors showing its location.\nBertie understands the power – for good or bad – of incentives, the weaknesses of humans,\nthe “tells” that can be recognized when observing human behavior. She knows who is “selling”\nand who can be trusted. In short, she is nobody’s fool.\nSo, what would interest Bertie this year?",

    "content": "Operating Results, Fact and Fiction\nLet’s begin with the numbers. The official annual report begins on K-1 and extends for 124\npages. It is filled with a vast amount of information – some important, some trivial.\nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page\nK-72. There, they will find the proverbial “bottom line” labeled “Net earnings (loss).” The\nnumbers read $90 billion for 2021, ($23 billion) for 2022 and $96 billion for 2023.\nWhat in the world is going on?\nYou seek guidance and are told that the procedures for calculating these “earnings” are\npromulgated by a sober and credentialed Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\nmandated by a dedicated and hard-working Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and\naudited by the world-class professionals at Deloitte & Touche (“D&T”). On page K-67, D&T pulls\nno punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material respects\n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . .\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2023 . . . . .”\nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted\nthroughout the world via the internet and media. All parties believe they have done their job – and,\nlegally, they have.\nWe, however, are left uncomfortable. At Berkshire, our view is that “earnings” should be a\nsensible concept that Bertie will find somewhat useful – but only as a starting point – in\nevaluating a business. Accordingly, Berkshire also reports to Bertie and you what we call\n“operating earnings.” Here is the story they tell: $27.6 billion for 2021; $30.9 billion for 2022 and\n$37.4 billion for 2023.\n\nThe primary difference between the mandated figures and the ones Berkshire prefers is that\nwe exclude unrealized capital gains or losses that at times can exceed $5 billion a day. Ironically,\nour preference was pretty much the rule until 2018, when the “improvement” was mandated.\nGalileo’s experience, several centuries ago, should have taught us not to mess with mandates from\non high. But, at Berkshire, we can be stubborn.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMake no mistake about the significance of capital gains: I expect them to be a very\nimportant component of Berkshire’s value accretion during the decades ahead. Why else would\nwe commit huge dollar amounts of your money (and Bertie’s) to marketable equities just as I have\nbeen doing with my own funds throughout my investing lifetime?\nI can’t remember a period since March 11,1942 – the date of my first stock purchase – that\nI have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U. S.-based equities. And so far, so good.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 100 on that fateful day in 1942 when I “pulled the\ntrigger.” I was down about $5 by the time school was out. Soon, things turned around and now that\nindex hovers around 38,000. America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have\nneeded to do is sit quietly, listening to no one.\nIt is more than silly, however, to make judgments about Berkshire’s investment value based\non “earnings” that incorporate the capricious day-by-day and, yes, even year-by-year movements\nof the stock market. As Ben Graham taught me, “In the short run the market acts as a voting\nmachine; in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.”",

    "content": "What We Do\nOur goal at Berkshire is simple: We want to own either all or a portion of businesses that\nenjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring. Within capitalism, some businesses will\nflourish for a very long time while others will prove to be sinkholes. It’s harder than you would\nthink to predict which will be the winners and losers. And those who tell you they know the answer\nare usually either self-delusional or snake-oil salesmen.\nAt Berkshire, we particularly favor the rare enterprise that can deploy additional capital at\nhigh returns in the future. Owning only one of these companies – and simply sitting tight – can\ndeliver wealth almost beyond measure. Even heirs to such a holding can – ugh! – sometimes live\na lifetime of leisure.\nWe also hope these favored businesses are run by able and trustworthy managers, though\nthat is a more difficult judgment to make, however, and Berkshire has had its share\nof disappointments.\n\nIn 1863, Hugh Mc Culloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, sent a letter to all\nnational banks. His instructions included this warning: “Never deal with a rascal under the\nexpectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.” Many bankers who thought they could\n“manage” the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. Mc Culloch’s advice – and I have as\nwell. People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true\nnow as it was in 1863.\nThis combination of the two necessities I’ve described for acquiring businesses has for\nlong been our goal in purchases and, for a while, we had an abundance of candidates to evaluate.\nIf I missed one – and I missed plenty – another always came along.\nThose days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases\nwas also a factor.\nBerkshire now has – by far – the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American\nbusiness. Record operating income and a strong stock market led to a yearend figure of $561\nbillion. The total GAAP net worth for the other 499 S&P companies – a who’s who of American\nbusiness – was $8.9 trillion in 2022. (The 2023 number for the S&P has not yet been tallied but is\nunlikely to materially exceed $9.5 trillion.)\nBy this measure, Berkshire now occupies nearly 6% of the universe in which it operates.\nDoubling our huge base is simply not possible within, say, a five-year period, particularly because\nwe are highly averse to issuing shares (an act that immediately juices net worth).\nThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the\nneedle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can\nvalue; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U. S., there\nare essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All\nin all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\nNevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive\nside, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various\nbusinesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large\nAmerican companies. By both luck and pluck, a few huge winners have emerged from a great\nmany dozens of decisions. And we now have a small cadre of long-time managers who never muse\nabout going elsewhere and who regard 65 as just another birthday.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire benefits from an unusual constancy and clarity of purpose. While we emphasize\ntreating our employees, communities and suppliers well – who wouldn’t wish to do so? – our\nallegiance will always be to our country and our shareholders. We never forget that, though your\nmoney is comingled with ours, it does not belong to us.\n\nWith that focus, and with our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better\nthan the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially\nless risk of permanent loss of capital. Anything beyond “slightly better,” though, is wishful\nthinking. This modest aspiration wasn’t the case when Bertie went all-in on Berkshire – but it\nis now.",

Indeed, markets can – and\nwill – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days\nin 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to\nSeptember 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant\nworldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t\nhappen often – but they will happen.\nBerkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and\ncertainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock\nmarket is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither\nmore emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets\nnow exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides\nin many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\nOne fact of financial life should never be forgotten. Wall Street – to use the term in its\nfigurative sense – would like its customers to make money, but what truly causes its denizens’\njuices to flow is feverish activity. At such times, whatever foolishness can be marketed will be\nvigorously marketed – not by everyone but always by someone.\nOccasionally, the scene turns ugly. The politicians then become enraged; the most flagrant\nperpetrators of misdeeds slip away, rich and unpunished; and your friend next door becomes\nbewildered, poorer and sometimes vengeful. Money, he learns, has trumped morality.\nOne investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss\nof capital.

When economic upsets occur, as they will,\nBerkshire’s goal will be to function as an asset to the country – just as it was in a very minor way\nin 2008-9 – and to help extinguish the financial fire rather than to be among the many companies\nthat, inadvertently or otherwise, ignited the conflagration.\n\nOur goal is realistic. Berkshire’s strength comes from its Niagara of diverse earnings\ndelivered after interest costs, taxes and substantial charges for depreciation and amortization\n(“EBITDA” is a banned measurement at Berkshire). We also operate with minimal requirements\nfor cash, even if the country encounters a prolonged period of global economic weakness, fear and\nnear-paralysis.\nBerkshire does not currently pay dividends, and its share repurchases are 100%\ndiscretionary. Annual debt maturities are never material.\nYour company also holds a cash and U. S. Treasury bill position far in excess of what\nconventional wisdom deems necessary. During the 2008 panic, Berkshire generated cash from\noperations and did not rely in any manner on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets. We\ndid not predict the time of an economic paralysis but we were always prepared for one.\nExtreme fiscal conservatism is a corporate pledge we make to those who have joined us in\nownership of Berkshire. In most years – indeed in most decades – our caution will likely prove to\nbe unneeded behavior – akin to an insurance policy on a fortress-like building thought to be\nfireproof. But Berkshire does not want to inflict permanent financial damage – quotational\nshrinkage for extended periods can’t be avoided – on Bertie or any of the individuals who have\ntrusted us with their savings.\nBerkshire is built to last.",

These are not huge commitments like our Apple\nposition. Each only accounts for 4-5% of Berkshire’s GAAP net worth. But they are meaningful\nassets and also illustrate our thought processes.\nAmerican Express began operations in 1850, and Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta\ndrug store in 1886. (Berkshire is not big on newcomers.) Both companies tried expanding into\nunrelated areas over the years and both found little success in these attempts. In the past – but\ndefinitely not now – both were even mismanaged.\nBut each was hugely successful in its base business, reshaped here and there as conditions\ncalled for. And, crucially, their products “traveled.” Both Coke and AMEX became recognizable\nnames worldwide as did their core products, and the consumption of liquids and the need for\nunquestioned financial trust are timeless essentials of our world.\n\nDuring 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own\nRip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again\nrewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of\nAMEX earnings in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase.\nBoth AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16%\nin the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the\nyear. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell\nyou: “No way.”\nThough Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect\nownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made\nat Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire\nowns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases\nshould be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done\nat a premium.\nThe lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with\nit.

    "content": "Non-controlled Businesses That Leave Us Comfortable\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThis year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain\nindefinitely. Like Coke and AMEX, these commitments are not huge relative to our resources.\nThey are worthwhile, however, and we were able to increase both positions during 2023.\nAt yearend, Berkshire owned 27.8% of Occidental Petroleum’s common shares and also\nowned warrants that, for more than five years, give us the option to materially increase our\nownership at a fixed price. Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option,\nBerkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental. We particularly like its vast oil\nand gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though\nthe economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very\nmuch in our country’s interest.\nNot so long ago, the U. S. was woefully dependent on foreign oil, and carbon capture had\nno meaningful constituency. Indeed, in 1975, U. S. production was eight million barrels of\noil-equivalent per day (“BOEPD”), a level far short of the country’s needs. From the favorable\nenergy position that facilitated the U. S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to\nbecome heavily dependent on foreign – potentially unstable – suppliers. Further declines in oil\nproduction were predicted along with future increases in usage.\n\nFor a long time, the pessimism appeared to be correct, with production falling to five\nmillion BOEPD by 2007. Meanwhile, the U. S. government created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n(“SPR”) in 1975 to alleviate – though not come close to eliminating – this erosion of American\nself-sufficiency.\nAnd then – Hallelujah! – shale economics became feasible in 2011, and our energy\ndependency ended. Now, U. S. production is more than 13 million BOEPD, and OPEC no longer\nhas the upper hand. Occidental itself has annual U. S. oil production that each year comes close to\nmatching the entire inventory of the SPR. Our country would be very – very – nervous today if\ndomestic production had remained at five million BOEPD, and it found itself hugely dependent\non non-U. S. sources. At that level, the SPR would have been emptied within months if foreign oil\nbecame unavailable.\nUnder Vicki Hollub’s leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country\nand its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But\nVicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that’s an uncommon talent, valuable to her\nshareholders and to her country.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAdditionally, Berkshire continues to hold its passive and long-term interest in five very\nlarge Japanese companies, each of which operates in a highly-diversified manner somewhat similar\nto the way Berkshire itself is run. We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel\nand I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five. (A minor point: Japanese companies\ncalculate outstanding shares in a manner different from the practice in the U. S.) Berkshire has also\npledged to each company that it will not purchase shares that will take our holdings beyond 9.9%.\nOur cost for the five totals ¥1.6 trillion, and the yearend market value of the five was ¥2.9 trillion.\nHowever, the yen has weakened in recent years and our yearend unrealized gain in dollars was\n61% or $8 billion.\nNeither Greg nor I believe we can forecast market prices of major currencies. We also don’t\nbelieve we can hire anyone with this ability. Therefore, Berkshire has financed most of its Japanese\nposition with the proceeds from ¥1.3 trillion of bonds. This debt has been very well-received in\nJapan, and I believe Berkshire has more yen-denominated debt outstanding than any other\nAmerican company. The weakened yen has produced a yearend gain for Berkshire of $1.9 billion,\na sum that, pursuant to GAAP rules, has periodically been recognized in income over the\n2020-23 period.\nIn certain important ways, all five companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and\nSumitomo – follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily\npracticed in the U. S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the\nnumber of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about\ntheir own compensation than is typical in the United States. Note as well that each of the five is\napplying only about 1⁄\nof its earnings to dividends. The large sums the five retain are used both to\nbuild their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five\ncompanies are reluctant to issue shares.\nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to\nopportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected\ncompanies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs\nhave the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be\ninstantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.\nOur Japanese purchases began on July 4,2019. Given Berkshire’s present size, building\npositions through open-market purchases takes a lot of patience and an extended period of\n“friendly” prices. The process is like turning a battleship. That is an important disadvantage which\nwe did not face in our early days at Berkshire.",

    "content": "The Scorecard in 2023\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $11⁄\nbillion annually. Ouch! That sort of\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\nintend to do.\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\n\nWage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\nrailroad responsibilities.\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\nBerkshire. You can count on that.",

    "content": "The Scorecard in 2023\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\ncontinental United States.\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactoryreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\n\nAt Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\nadopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930 s and there are many\npublic-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will\ndecide which model they prefer.\nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns\nand, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.",

Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”)\nprovides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years\nand despite our nearly 5,000-fold increase in volume – from $17 million to $83 billion – we have\nmuch room to grow.\nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid. The most important lesson is that our\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\nSurprises in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\ndetection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates\nof future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card.\n\nI’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\nnewcomers to page 18.

Their names and faces are\nunknown to most of the press and the public. Berkshire’s lineup of managers, however, is to P/C\ninsurance what Cooperstown’s honorees are to baseball.\nBertie, you can feel good about the fact that you own a piece of an incredible P/C operation\nthat now operates worldwide with unmatched financial resources, reputation and talent.

    "content": "What is it with Omaha?\nCome to Berkshire’s annual gathering on May 4,2024. On stage you will see the three\nmanagers who now bear the prime responsibilities for steering your company. What, you may\nwonder, do the three have in common? They certainly don’t look alike. Let’s dig deeper.\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire – and in all respects is\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow – was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey).\nIn the 1990 s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During\nthat period, I never met him.\nA decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his\nfamily in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I’ve lived since 1958). Both Ajit and his\nwife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved\nto New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about\ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived\nabout a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent\nour early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We\ndidn’t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15\nof America’s 45 presidents. People refer to President Biden as #46, but that numbering counts\nGrover Cleveland as both #22 and #24 because his terms were not consecutive. America is a very\nyoung country.)\n\nMoving to the corporate level, Berkshire itself relocated in 1970 from its 81 years of\nresidence in New England to settle in Omaha, leaving its troubles behind and blossoming in its\nnew home.\nAs a final punctuation point to the “Omaha Effect,” Bertie – yes that Bertie – spent her\nearly formative years in a middle-class neighborhood in Omaha and, many decades later, emerged\nas one of the country’s great investors.\nYou may be thinking that she put all of her money in Berkshire and then simply sat on it.\nBut that’s not true. After starting a family in 1956, Bertie was active financially for 20 years:\nholding bonds, putting 1⁄\nof her funds in a publicly-held mutual fund and trading stocks with some\nfrequency. Her potential remained unnoticed.\nThen, in 1980, when 46, and independent of any urgings from her brother, Bertie decided\nto make her move. Retaining only the mutual fund and Berkshire, she made no new trades during\nthe next 43 years. During that period, she became very rich, even after making large philanthropic\ngifts (think nine figures).\nMillions of American investors could have followed her reasoning which involved only\nthe common sense she had somehow absorbed as a child in Omaha. And, taking no chances, Bertie\nreturns to Omaha every May to be re-energized.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSo what is going on? Is it Omaha’s water? Is it Omaha’s air? Is it some strange planetary\nphenomenon akin to that which has produced Jamaica’s sprinters, Kenya’s marathon runners, or\nRussia’s chess experts? Must we wait until AI someday yields the answer to this puzzle?\nKeep an open mind. Come to Omaha in May, inhale the air, drink the water and say “hi”\nto Bertie and her good-looking daughters. Who knows? There is no downside, and, in any event,\nyou will have a good time and meet a huge crowd of friendly people.\nTo top things off, we will have available the new 4 th edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack.\nPick up a copy. Charlie’s wisdom will improve your life as it has mine.\nFebruary 24,2024 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
