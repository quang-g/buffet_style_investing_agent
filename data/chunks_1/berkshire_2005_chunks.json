    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 2005 was $5.6 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 41 years (that is, since present management\ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $59,377, a rate of 21.5% compounded annually.*\nBerkshire had a decent year in 2005. We initiated five acquisitions (two of which have yet to\nclose) and most of our operating subsidiaries prospered. Even our insurance business in its entirety did\nwell, though Hurricane Katrina inflicted record losses on both Berkshire and the industry. We estimate our\nloss from Katrina at $2.5 billion – and her ugly sisters, Rita and Wilma, cost us an additional $. 9 billion.\nCredit GEICO – and its brilliant CEO, Tony Nicely – for our stellar insurance results in a disasterridden year. One statistic stands out: In just two years, GEICO improved its productivity by 32%.\nRemarkably, employment fell by 4% even as policy count grew by 26% – and more gains are in store.\nWhen we drive unit costs down in such a dramatic manner, we can offer ever-greater value to our\ncustomers. The payoff: Last year, GEICO gained market-share, earned commendable profits and\nstrengthened its brand. If you have a new son or grandson in 2006, name him Tony.",

    "content": "\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMy goal in writing this report is to give you the information you need to estimate Berkshire’s\nintrinsic value. I say “estimate” because calculations of intrinsic value, though all-important, are\nnecessarily imprecise and often seriously wrong. The more uncertain the future of a business, the more\npossibility there is that the calculation will be wildly off-base. (For an explanation of intrinsic value, see\npages 77 – 78.) Here Berkshire has some advantages: a wide variety of relatively-stable earnings streams,\ncombined with great liquidity and minimum debt. These factors mean that Berkshire’s intrinsic value can\nbe more precisely calculated than can the intrinsic value of most companies.\nYet if precision is aided by Berkshire’s financial characteristics, the job of calculating intrinsic\nvalue has been made more complex by the mere presence of so many earnings streams. Back in 1965,\nwhen we owned only a small textile operation, the task of calculating intrinsic value was a snap. Now we\nown 68 distinct businesses with widely disparate operating and financial characteristics. This array of\nunrelated enterprises, coupled with our massive investment holdings, makes it impossible for you to simply\nexamine our consolidated financial statements and arrive at an informed estimate of intrinsic value.\nWe have attempted to ease this problem by clustering our businesses into four logical groups, each\nof which we discuss later in this report. In these discussions, we will provide the key figures for both the\ngroup and its important components. Of course, the value of Berkshire may be either greater or less than\nthe sum of these four parts. The outcome depends on whether our many units function better or worse by\nbeing part of a larger enterprise and whether capital allocation improves or deteriorates when it is under the\ndirection of a holding company. In other words, does Berkshire ownership bring anything to the party, or\nwould our shareholders be better off if they directly owned shares in each of our 68 businesses? These are\nimportant questions but ones that you will have to answer for yourself.\n",

The first set is the amount of investments (including cash\nand cash-equivalents) we own on a per-share basis. In making this calculation, we exclude investments\nheld in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings:\n*All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares, the successor to the only stock that\nthe company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30 th that of\nthe A.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nYear Per-Share Investments*\n1965 ..................................................................... $ 4\n1975 ..................................................................... 159\n1985 ..................................................................... 2,407\n1995 ..................................................................... 21,817\n2005 ..................................................................... $74,129\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2005.................... 28.0%\nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2005.................... 13.0%\n*Net of minority interests\nIn addition to these marketable securities, which with minor exceptions are held in our insurance\ncompanies, we own a wide variety of non-insurance businesses. Below, we show the pre-tax earnings\n(excluding goodwill amortization) of these businesses, again on a per-share basis:\nYear Per-Share Earnings*\n1965 ..................................................................... $ 4\n1975 ..................................................................... 4\n1985 ..................................................................... 52\n1995 ..................................................................... 175\n2005 ..................................................................... $2,441\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2005.................... 17.2%\nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2005.................... 30.2%\n*Pre-tax and net of minority interests\nWhen growth rates are under discussion, it will pay you to be suspicious as to why the beginning\nand terminal years have been selected. If either year was aberrational, any calculation of growth will be\ndistorted. In particular, a base year in which earnings were poor can produce a breathtaking, but\nmeaningless, growth rate. In the table above, however, the base year of 1965 was abnormally good;\nBerkshire earned more money in that year than it did in all but one of the previous ten.\nAs you can see from the two tables, the comparative growth rates of Berkshire’s two elements of\nvalue have changed in the last decade, a result reflecting our ever-increasing emphasis on business\nacquisitions. Nevertheless, Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I want to\nincrease the figures in both tables. In this ambition, we hope – metaphorically – to avoid the fate of the\nelderly couple who had been romantically challenged for some time. As they finished dinner on their 50 th\nanniversary, however, the wife – stimulated by soft music, wine and candlelight – felt a long-absent tickle\nand demurely suggested to her husband that they go upstairs and make love. He agonized for a moment\nand then replied, “I can do one or the other, but not both.”",

    "content": "\nAcquisitions\nOver the years, our current businesses, in aggregate, should deliver modest growth in operating\nearnings. But they will not in themselves produce truly satisfactory gains. We will need major acquisitions\nto get that job done.\nIn this quest, 2005 was encouraging. We agreed to five purchases: two that were completed last\nyear, one that closed after yearend and two others that we expect to close soon. None of the deals involve\nthe issuance of Berkshire shares. That’s a crucial, but often ignored, point: When a management proudly\nacquires another company for stock, the shareholders of the acquirer are concurrently selling part of their\ninterest in everything they own. I’ve made this kind of deal a few times myself – and, on balance, my\nactions have cost you money.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nHere are last year’s purchases:\n• On June 30 we bought Medical Protective Company (“Med Pro”), a 106-year-old medical\nmalpractice insurer based in Fort Wayne. Malpractice insurance is tough to underwrite and has\nproved to be a graveyard for many insurers. Med Pro nevertheless should do well. It will have the\nattitudinal advantage that all Berkshire insurers share, wherein underwriting discipline trumps all\nother goals. Additionally, as part of Berkshire, Med Pro has financial strength far exceeding that of\nits competitors, a quality assuring doctors that long-to-settle claims will not end up back on their\ndoorstep because their insurer failed. Finally, the company has a smart and energetic CEO, Tim\nKenesey, who instinctively thinks like a Berkshire manager.\n• Forest River, our second acquisition, closed on August 31. A couple of months earlier, on June\n21, I received a two-page fax telling me – point by point – why Forest River met the acquisition\ncriteria we set forth on page 25 of this report. I had not before heard of the company, a\nrecreational vehicle manufacturer with $1.6 billion of sales, nor of Pete Liegl, its owner and\nmanager. But the fax made sense, and I immediately asked for more figures. These came the next\nmorning, and that afternoon I made Pete an offer. On June 28, we shook hands on a deal.\nPete is a remarkable entrepreneur. Some years back, he sold his business, then far smaller than\ntoday, to an LBO operator who promptly began telling him how to run the place. Before long,\nPete left, and the business soon sunk into bankruptcy. Pete then repurchased it. You can be sure\nthat I won’t be telling Pete how to manage his operation.\nForest River has 60 plants, 5,400 employees and has consistently gained share in the RV business,\nwhile also expanding into other areas such as boats. Pete is 61 – and definitely in an acceleration\nmode. Read the piece from RV Business that accompanies this report, and you’ll see why Pete and\nBerkshire are made for each other.\n• On November 12,2005, an article ran in The Wall Street Journal dealing with Berkshire’s unusual\nacquisition and managerial practices. In it Pete declared, “It was easier to sell my business than to\nrenew my driver’s license.”\nIn New York, Cathy Baron Tamraz read the article, and it struck a chord. On November 21, she\nsent me a letter that began, “As president of Business Wire, I’d like to introduce you to my\ncompany, as I believe it fits the profile of Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary companies as detailed in\na recent Wall Street Journal article.”\nBy the time I finished Cathy’s two-page letter, I felt Business Wire and Berkshire were a fit. I\nparticularly liked her penultimate paragraph: “We run a tight ship and keep unnecessary spending\nunder wraps. No secretaries or management layers here. Yet we’ll invest big dollars to gain a\ntechnological advantage and move the business forward.”\nI promptly gave Cathy a call, and before long Berkshire had reached agreement with Business\nWire’s controlling shareholder, Lorry Lokey, who founded the company in 1961 (and who had\njust made Cathy CEO). I love success stories like Lorry’s. Today 78, he has built a company that\ndisseminates information in 150 countries for 25,000 clients. His story, like those of many\nentrepreneurs who have selected Berkshire as a home for their life’s work, is an example of what\ncan happen when a good idea, a talented individual and hard work converge.\n• In December we agreed to buy 81% of Applied Underwriters, a company that offers a combination\nof payroll services and workers’ compensation insurance to small businesses. A majority of\nApplied’s customers are located in California.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nIn 1998, though, when the company had 12 employees, it acquired an Omaha-based operation\nwith 24 employees that offered a somewhat-similar service. Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies, who\nhave built Applied’s remarkable business, concluded that Omaha had many advantages as an\noperational base – a brilliant insight, I might add – and today 400 of the company’s 479\nemployees are located here.\nLess than a year ago, Applied entered into a large reinsurance contract with Ajit Jain, the\nextraordinary manager of National Indemnity’s reinsurance division. Ajit was impressed by Sid\nand Steve, and they liked Berkshire’s method of operation. So we decided to join forces. We are\npleased that Sid and Steve retain 19% of Applied. They started on a shoestring only 12 years ago,\nand it will be fun to see what they can accomplish with Berkshire’s backing.\n• Last spring, Mid American Energy, our 80.5% owned subsidiary, agreed to buy Pacifi Corp, a\nmajor electric utility serving six Western states. An acquisition of this sort requires many\nregulatory approvals, but we’ve now obtained these and expect to close this transaction soon.\nBerkshire will then buy $3.4 billion of Mid American’s common stock, which Mid American will\nsupplement with $1.7 billion of borrowing to complete the purchase. You can’t expect to earn\noutsized profits in regulated utilities, but the industry offers owners the opportunity to deploy large\nsums at fair returns – and therefore, it makes good sense for Berkshire. A few years back, I said\nthat we hoped to make some very large purchases in the utility field. Note the plural – we’ll be\nlooking for more.\nIn addition to buying these new operations, we continue to make “bolt-on” acquisitions. Some\naren’t so small: Shaw, our carpet operation, spent about $550 million last year on two purchases that\nfurthered its vertical integration and should improve its profit margin in the future. XTRA and Clayton\nHomes also made value-enhancing acquisitions.\nUnlike many business buyers, Berkshire has no “exit strategy.” We buy to keep. We do, though,\nhave an entrance strategy, looking for businesses in this country or abroad that meet our six criteria and are\navailable at a price that will produce a reasonable return. If you have a business that fits, give me a call.\nLike a hopeful teenage girl, I’ll be waiting by the phone.",

    "content": "\nInsurance\nLet’s now talk about our four sectors and start with insurance, our core business. What counts\nhere is the amount of “float” and its cost over time.\nFor new readers, let me explain. “Float” is money that doesn’t belong to us but that we\ntemporarily hold. Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are paid upfront though the service we\nprovide – insurance protection – is delivered over a period that usually covers a year and; (2) loss events\nthat occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims, because it sometimes takes many\nyears for losses to be reported (asbestos losses would be an example), negotiated and settled. The $20\nmillion of float that came with our 1967 entry into insurance has now increased – both by way of internal\ngrowth and acquisitions – to $49 billion.\nFloat is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price. Its cost is determined by underwriting\nresults, meaning how the expenses and losses we will ultimately pay compare with the premiums we have\nreceived. When an insurer earns an underwriting profit – as has been the case at Berkshire in about half of\nthe 39 years we have been in the insurance business – float is better than free. In such years, we are\nactually paid for holding other people’s money. For most insurers, however, life has been far more\ndifficult: In aggregate, the property-casualty industry almost invariably operates at an underwriting loss.\nWhen that loss is large, float becomes expensive, sometimes devastatingly so.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nIn 2004 our float cost us less than nothing, and I told you that we had a chance – absent a megacatastrophe – of no-cost float in 2005. But we had the mega-cat, and as a specialist in that coverage,\nBerkshire suffered hurricane losses of $3.4 billion. Nevertheless, our float was costless in 2005 because of\nthe superb results we had in our other insurance activities, particularly at GEICO.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAuto policies in force grew by 12.1% at GEICO, a gain increasing its market share of U. S. private\npassenger auto business from about 5.6% to about 6.1%. Auto insurance is a big business: Each sharepoint equates to $1.6 billion in sales.\nWhile our brand strength is not quantifiable, I believe it also grew significantly. When Berkshire\nacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its annual advertising expenditures were $31 million. Last year we\nwere up to $502 million. And I can’t wait to spend more.\nOur advertising works because we have a great story to tell: More people can save money by\ninsuring with us than is the case with any other national carrier offering policies to all comers. (Some\nspecialized auto insurers do particularly well for applicants fitting into their niches; also, because our\nnational competitors use rating systems that differ from ours, they will sometimes beat our price.) Last\nyear, we achieved by far the highest conversion rate – the percentage of internet and phone quotes turned\ninto sales – in our history. This is powerful evidence that our prices are more attractive relative to the\ncompetition than ever before. Test us by going to GEICO. com or by calling 800-847-7536. Be sure to\nindicate you are a shareholder because that fact will often qualify you for a discount.\nI told you last year about GEICO’s entry into New Jersey in August, 2004. Drivers in that state\nlove us. Our retention rate there for new policyholders is running higher than in any other state, and by\nsometime in 2007, GEICO is likely to become the third largest auto insurer in New Jersey. There, as\nelsewhere, our low costs allow low prices that lead to steady gains in profitable business.\nThat simple formula immediately impressed me 55 years ago when I first discovered GEICO.\nIndeed, at age 21, I wrote an article about the company – it’s reproduced on page 24 – when its market\nvalue was $7 million. As you can see, I called GEICO “The Security I Like Best.” And that’s what I still\ncall it.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe have major reinsurance operations at General Re and National Indemnity. The former is run\nby Joe Brandon and Tad Montross, the latter by Ajit Jain. Both units performed well in 2005 considering\nthe extraordinary hurricane losses that battered the industry.\nIt’s an open question whether atmospheric, oceanic or other causal factors have dramatically\nchanged the frequency or intensity of hurricanes. Recent experience is worrisome. We know, for instance,\nthat in the 100 years before 2004, about 59 hurricanes of Category 3 strength, or greater, hit the\nSoutheastern and Gulf Coast states, and that only three of these were Category 5 s. We further know that in\n2004 there were three Category 3 storms that hammered those areas and that these were followed by four\nmore in 2005, one of them, Katrina, the most destructive hurricane in industry history. Moreover, there\nwere three Category 5 s near the coast last year that fortunately weakened before landfall.\nWas this onslaught of more frequent and more intense storms merely an anomaly? Or was it\ncaused by changes in climate, water temperature or other variables we don’t fully understand? And could\nthese factors be developing in a manner that will soon produce disasters dwarfing Katrina?\nJoe, Ajit and I don’t know the answer to these all-important questions. What we do know is that\nour ignorance means we must follow the course prescribed by Pascal in his famous wager about the\nexistence of God. As you may recall, he concluded that since he didn’t know the answer, his personal\ngain/loss ratio dictated an affirmative conclusion.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nSo guided, we’ve concluded that we should now write mega-cat policies only at prices far higher\nthan prevailed last year – and then only with an aggregate exposure that would not cause us distress if shifts\nin some important variable produce far more costly storms in the near future. To a lesser degree, we felt\nthis way after 2004 – and cut back our writings when prices didn’t move. Now our caution has intensified.\nIf prices seem appropriate, however, we continue to have both the ability and the appetite to be the largest\nwriter of mega-cat coverage in the world.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur smaller insurers, with Med Pro added to the fold, delivered truly outstanding results last year.\nHowever, what you see in the table below does not do full justice to their performance. That’s because we\nincreased the loss reserves of Med Pro by about $125 million immediately after our purchase.\nNo one knows with any precision what amount will be required to pay the claims we inherited.\nMedical malpractice insurance is a “long-tail” line, meaning that claims often take many years to settle. In\naddition, there are other losses that have occurred, but that we won’t even hear about for some time. One\nthing, though, we have learned – the hard way – after many years in the business: Surprises in insurance are\nfar from symmetrical. You are lucky if you get one that is pleasant for every ten that go the other way.\nToo often, however, insurers react to looming loss problems with optimism. They behave like the fellow in\na switchblade fight who, after his opponent has taken a mighty swipe at his throat, exclaimed, “You never\ntouched me.” His adversary’s reply: “Just wait until you try to shake your head.”\nExcluding the reserves we added for prior periods, Med Pro wrote at an underwriting profit. And\nour other primary companies, in aggregate, had an underwriting profit of $324 million on $1,270 million of\nvolume. This is an extraordinary result, and our thanks go to Rod Eldred of Berkshire Hathaway\nHomestate Companies, John Kizer of Central States Indemnity, Tom Nerney of U. S. Liability, Don Towle\nof Kansas Bankers Surety and Don Wurster of National Indemnity.\n",

The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose\n3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U. K.; (2)\nMid American Energy, which serves 706,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; and (3) Kern River and\nNorthern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.8% of the natural gas consumed in the U. S. When our Pacifi Corp\nacquisition closes, we will add 1.6 million electric customers in six Western states, with Oregon and Utah\nproviding us the most business. This transaction will increase Mid American’s revenues by $3.3 billion and\nits assets by $14.1 billion.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nThe Public Utility Holding Company Act (“PUHCA”) was repealed on August 8,2005, a\nmilestone that allowed Berkshire to convert its Mid American preferred stock into voting common shares on\nFebruary 9,2006. This conversion ended a convoluted corporate arrangement that PUHCA had forced\nupon us. Now we have 83.4% of both the common stock and the votes at Mid American, which allows us\nto consolidate the company’s income for financial accounting and tax purposes. Our true economic\ninterest, however, is the aforementioned 80.5%, since there are options outstanding that are sure to be\nexercised within a few years and that upon exercise will dilute our ownership.\nThough our voting power has increased dramatically, the dynamics of our four-party ownership\nhave not changed at all. We view Mid American as a partnership among Berkshire, Walter Scott, and two\nterrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel. It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we will\nmake major moves only when we are unanimous in thinking them wise. Five years of working with Dave,\nGreg and Walter have underscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners.\nYou will notice that this year we have provided you with two balance sheets, one representing our\nactual figures per GAAP on December 31,2005 (which does not consolidate Mid American) and one that\nreflects the subsequent conversion of our preferred. All future financial reports of Berkshire will include\nMid American’s figures.\nSomewhat incongruously, Mid American owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the\nU. S. And it’s a gem. The parent company’s name is Home Services of America, but our 19,200 agents\noperate through 18 locally-branded firms. Aided by three small acquisitions, we participated in $64 billion\nof transactions last year, up 6.5% from 2004.\n\nCurrently, the white-hot market in residential real estate of recent years is cooling down, and that\nshould lead to additional acquisition possibilities for us. Both we and Ron Peltier, the company’s CEO,\nexpect Home Services to be far larger a decade from now.\n",

    "content": "\nFinance and Financial Products\nThe star of our finance sector is Clayton Homes, masterfully run by Kevin Clayton. He does not\nowe his brilliant record to a rising tide: The manufactured-housing business has been disappointing since\nBerkshire purchased Clayton in 2003. Industry sales have stagnated at 40-year lows, and the recent uptick\nfrom Katrina-related demand will almost certainly be short-lived. In recent years, many industry\nparticipants have suffered losses, and only Clayton has earned significant money.\nIn this brutal environment Clayton has bought a large amount of manufactured-housing loans from\nmajor banks that found them unprofitable and difficult to service. Clayton’s operating expertise and\nBerkshire’s financial resources have made this an excellent business for us and one in which we are\npreeminent. We presently service $17 billion of loans, compared to $5.4 billon at the time of our purchase.\nMoreover, Clayton now owns $9.6 billion of its servicing portfolio, a position built up almost entirely since\nBerkshire entered the picture.\nTo finance this portfolio, Clayton borrows money from Berkshire, which in turn borrows the same\namount publicly. For the use of its credit, Berkshire charges Clayton a one percentage-point markup on its\nborrowing cost. In 2005, the cost to Clayton for this arrangement was $83 million. That amount is\nincluded in “Other” income in the table on the facing page, and Clayton’s earnings of $416 million are after\ndeducting this payment.\nOn the manufacturing side, Clayton has also been active. To its original base of twenty plants, it\nfirst added twelve more in 2004 by way of the bankruptcy purchase of Oakwood, which just a few years\nearlier was one of the largest companies in the business. Then in 2005 Clayton purchased Karsten, a fourplant operation that greatly strengthens Clayton’s position on the West Coast.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLong ago, Mark Twain said: “A man who tries to carry a cat home by its tail will learn a lesson\nthat can be learned in no other way.” If Twain were around now, he might try winding up a derivatives\nbusiness. After a few days, he would opt for cats.\nWe lost $104 million pre-tax last year in our continuing attempt to exit Gen Re’s derivative\noperation. Our aggregate losses since we began this endeavor total $404 million.\nOriginally we had 23,218 contracts outstanding. By the start of 2005 we were down to 2,890.\nYou might expect that our losses would have been stemmed by this point, but the blood has kept flowing.\nReducing our inventory to 741 contracts last year cost us the $104 million mentioned above.\nRemember that the rationale for establishing this unit in 1990 was Gen Re’s wish to meet the\nneeds of insurance clients. Yet one of the contracts we liquidated in 2005 had a term of 100 years! It’s\ndifficult to imagine what “need” such a contract could fulfill except, perhaps, the need of a compensationconscious trader to have a long-dated contract on his books. Long contracts, or alternatively those with\nmultiple variables, are the most difficult to mark to market (the standard procedure used in accounting for\nderivatives) and provide the most opportunity for “imagination” when traders are estimating their value.\nSmall wonder that traders promote them.\nA business in which huge amounts of compensation flow from assumed numbers is obviously\nfraught with danger. When two traders execute a transaction that has several, sometimes esoteric, variables\nand a far-off settlement date, their respective firms must subsequently value these contracts whenever they\ncalculate their earnings. A given contract may be valued at one price by Firm A and at another by Firm B.\nYou can bet that the valuation differences – and I’m personally familiar with several that were huge – tend\nto be tilted in a direction favoring higher earnings at each firm. It’s a strange world in which two parties\ncan carry out a paper transaction that each can promptly report as profitable.\nI dwell on our experience in derivatives each year for two reasons. One is personal and\nunpleasant. The hard fact is that I have cost you a lot of money by not moving immediately to close down\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nGen Re’s trading operation. Both Charlie and I knew at the time of the Gen Re purchase that it was a\nproblem and told its management that we wanted to exit the business. It was my responsibility to make\nsure that happened. Rather than address the situation head on, however, I wasted several years while we\nattempted to sell the operation. That was a doomed endeavor because no realistic solution could have\nextricated us from the maze of liabilities that was going to exist for decades. Our obligations were\nparticularly worrisome because their potential to explode could not be measured. Moreover, if severe\ntrouble occurred, we knew it was likely to correlate with problems elsewhere in financial markets.\nSo I failed in my attempt to exit painlessly, and in the meantime more trades were put on the\nbooks. Fault me for dithering. (Charlie calls it thumb-sucking.) When a problem exists, whether in\npersonnel or in business operations, the time to act is now.\nThe second reason I regularly describe our problems in this area lies in the hope that our\nexperiences may prove instructive for managers, auditors and regulators. In a sense, we are a canary in this\nbusiness coal mine and should sing a song of warning as we expire. The number and value of derivative\ncontracts outstanding in the world continues to mushroom and is now a multiple of what existed in 1998,\nthe last time that financial chaos erupted.\nOur experience should be particularly sobering because we were a better-than-average candidate\nto exit gracefully. Gen Re was a relatively minor operator in the derivatives field. It has had the good\nfortune to unwind its supposedly liquid positions in a benign market, all the while free of financial or other\npressures that might have forced it to conduct the liquidation in a less-than-efficient manner. Our\naccounting in the past was conventional and actually thought to be conservative. Additionally, we know of\nno bad behavior by anyone involved.\nIt could be a different story for others in the future. Imagine, if you will, one or more firms\n(troubles often spread) with positions that are many multiples of ours attempting to liquidate in chaotic\nmarkets and under extreme, and well-publicized, pressures. This is a scenario to which much attention\nshould be given now rather than after the fact. The time to have considered – and improved – the reliability\nof New Orleans’ levees was before Katrina.\nWhen we finally wind up Gen Re Securities, my feelings about its departure will be akin to those\nexpressed in a country song, “My wife ran away with my best friend, and I sure miss him a lot.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n",

Let’s look, though, at a summary\nbalance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group.\n\nBalance Sheet 12/31/05 (in $ millions)\n\nAssets Liabilities and Equity\nCash and equivalents.............................. $ 1,004 Notes payable............................ $ 1,469\nAccounts and notes receivable............... 3,287 Other current liabilities.............. 5,371\nInventory................................................ 4,143 Total current liabilities.............. 6,840\nOther current assets................................ 342\nTotal current assets................................. 8,776\nGoodwill and other intangibles............... 9,260 Deferred taxes............................ 338\nFixed assets............................................. 7,148 Term debt and other liabilities... 2,188\nOther assets............................................. 1,021 Equity........................................ 16,839\n$26,205 $26,205\n\nEarnings Statement (in $ millions)\n2005 2004 2003\nRevenues.................................................................................... $46,896 $44,142 $32,106\nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $699 in 2005,\n$676 in 2004 and $605 in 2003).......................................... 44,190 41,604 29,885\nInterest expense (net).................................................................. 83 57 64\nPre-tax earnings.......................................................................... 2,623 2,481 2,157\nIncome taxes............................................................................... 977 941 813\nNet income................................................................................. $ 1,646 $ 1,540 $ 1,344\nThis eclectic collection, which sells products ranging from Dilly Bars to fractional interests in\nBoeing 737 s, earned a very respectable 22.2% on average tangible net worth last year. It’s noteworthy also\nthat these operations used only minor financial leverage in achieving that return. Clearly, we own some\nterrific businesses. We purchased many of them, however, at substantial premiums to net worth – a point\nreflected in the goodwill item shown on the balance sheet – and that fact reduces the earnings on our\naverage carrying value to 10.1%.\nHere are the pre-tax earnings for the larger categories or units.\n\nPre-Tax Earnings\n(in $ millions)\n2005 2004\nBuilding Products.................................................................................................... $ 751 $ 643\nShaw Industries....................................................................................................... 485 466\nApparel & Footwear................................................................................................ 348 325\nRetailing of Jewelry, Home Furnishings and Candy............................................... 257 215\nFlight Services......................................................................................................... 120 191\nMc Lane.................................................................................................................... 217 228\nOther businesses...................................................................................................... 445 413\n$2,623 $2,481\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n• In both our building-products companies and at Shaw, we continue to be hit by rising costs for raw\nmaterials and energy. Most of these operations are significant users of oil (or more specifically,\npetrochemicals) and natural gas. And prices for these commodities have soared.\nWe, likewise, have raised prices on many products, but there are often lags before increases become effective. Nevertheless, both our building-products operations and Shaw delivered respectable results in 2005, a fact attributable to their strong business franchises and able managements.\n• In apparel, our largest unit, Fruit of the Loom, again increased earnings and market-share. You\nknow, of course, of our leadership position in men’s and boys’ underwear, in which we account\nfor about 48.7% of the sales recorded by mass-marketers (Wal-Mart, Target, etc.). That’s up from\n44.2% in 2002, when we acquired the company. Operating from a smaller base, we have made\nstill greater gains in intimate apparel for women and girls that is sold by the mass-marketers,\nclimbing from 13.7% of their sales in 2002 to 24.7% in 2005. A gain like that in a major category\ndoesn’t come easy. Thank John Holland, Fruit’s extraordinary CEO, for making this happen.\n• I told you last year that Ben Bridge (jewelry) and R. C. Willey (home furnishings) had same-store\nsales gains far above the average of their industries. You might think that blow-out figures in one\nyear would make comparisons difficult in the following year. But Ed and Jon Bridge at their\noperation and Scott Hymas at R. C. Willey were more than up to this challenge. Ben Bridge had a\n6.6% same-store gain in 2005, and R. C. Willey came in at 9.9%.\nOur never-on-Sunday approach at R. C. Willey continues to overwhelm seven-day competitors as\nwe roll out stores in new markets. The Boise store, about which I was such a skeptic a few years\nback, had a 21% gain in 2005, coming off a 10% gain in 2004. Our new Reno store, opened in\nNovember, broke out of the gate fast with sales that exceeded Boise’s early pace, and we will\nbegin business in Sacramento in June. If this store succeeds as I expect it to, Californians will see\nmany more R. C. Willey stores in the years to come.\n• In flight services, earnings improved at Flight Safety as corporate aviation continued its rebound.\nTo support growth, we invest heavily in new simulators. Our most recent expansion, bringing us\nto 42 training centers, is a major facility at Farnborough, England that opened in September.\nWhen it is fully built out in 2007, we will have invested more than $100 million in the building\nand its 15 simulators. Bruce Whitman, Flight Safety’s able CEO, makes sure that no competitor\ncomes close to offering the breadth and depth of services that we do.\nOperating results at Net Jets were a different story. I said last year that this business would earn\nmoney in 2005 – and I was dead wrong.\nOur European operation, it should be noted, showed both excellent growth and a reduced loss.\nCustomer contracts there increased by 37%. We are the only fractional-ownership operation of\nany size in Europe, and our now-pervasive presence there is a key factor in making Net Jets the\nworldwide leader in this industry.\nDespite a large increase in customers, however, our U. S. operation dipped far into the red. Its\nefficiency fell, and costs soared. We believe that our three largest competitors suffered similar\nproblems, but each is owned by aircraft manufacturers that may think differently than we do about\nthe necessity of making adequate profits. The combined value of the fleets managed by these\nthree competitors, in any case, continues to be less valuable than the fleet that we operate.\nRich Santulli, one of the most dynamic managers I’ve ever met, will solve our revenue/expense\nproblem. He won’t do it, however, in a manner that impairs the quality of the Net Jets experience.\nBoth he and I are committed to a level of service, security and safety that can’t be matched by\nothers.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n• Our retailing category includes See’s Candies, a company we bought early in 1972 (a date making\nit our oldest non-insurance business). At that time, Charlie and I immediately decided to put\nChuck Huggins, then 46, in charge. Though we were new at the game of selecting managers,\nCharlie and I hit a home run with this appointment. Chuck’s love for the customer and the brand\npermeated the organization, which in his 34-year tenure produced a more-than-tenfold increase in\nprofits. This gain was achieved in an industry growing at best slowly and perhaps not at all.\n(Volume figures in this industry are hard to pin down.)\nAt yearend, Chuck turned the reins at See’s over to Brad Kinstler, who previously had served\nBerkshire well while running Cypress Insurance and Fechheimer’s. It’s unusual for us to move\nmanagers around, but Brad’s record made him an obvious choice for the See’s job. I hope Chuck\nand his wife, Donna, are at the annual meeting. If they are, shareholders can join Charlie and me\nin giving America’s number one candy maker a richly-deserved round of applause.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nEvery day, in countless ways, the competitive position of each of our businesses grows either\nweaker or stronger. If we are delighting customers, eliminating unnecessary costs and improving our\nproducts and services, we gain strength. But if we treat customers with indifference or tolerate bloat, our\nbusinesses will wither. On a daily basis, the effects of our actions are imperceptible; cumulatively, though,\ntheir consequences are enormous.\nWhen our long-term competitive position improves as a result of these almost unnoticeable\nactions, we describe the phenomenon as “widening the moat.” And doing that is essential if we are to have\nthe kind of business we want a decade or two from now. We always, of course, hope to earn more money\nin the short-term. But when short-term and long-term conflict, widening the moat must take precedence. If\na management makes bad decisions in order to hit short-term earnings targets, and consequently gets\nbehind the eight-ball in terms of costs, customer satisfaction or brand strength, no amount of subsequent\nbrilliance will overcome the damage that has been inflicted. Take a look at the dilemmas of managers in\nthe auto and airline industries today as they struggle with the huge problems handed them by their\npredecessors. Charlie is fond of quoting Ben Franklin’s “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of\ncure.” But sometimes no amount of cure will overcome the mistakes of the past.\nOur managers focus on moat-widening – and are brilliant at it. Quite simply, they are passionate\nabout their businesses. Usually, they were running those long before we came along; our only function\nsince has been to stay out of the way. If you see these heroes – and our four heroines as well – at the\nannual meeting, thank them for the job they do for you.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe attitude of our managers vividly contrasts with that of the young man who married a tycoon’s\nonly child, a decidedly homely and dull lass. Relieved, the father called in his new son-in-law after the\nwedding and began to discuss the future:\n“Son, you’re the boy I always wanted and never had. Here’s a stock certificate for 50% of the\ncompany. You’re my equal partner from now on.”\n“Thanks, dad.”\n“Now, what would you like to run? How about sales?”\n“I’m afraid I couldn’t sell water to a man crawling in the Sahara.”\n“Well then, how about heading human relations?”\n“I really don’t care for people.”\n“No problem, we have lots of other spots in the business. What would you like to do?”\n“Actually, nothing appeals to me. Why don’t you just buy me out?”\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n",

    "content": "\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe P&G-Gillette merger, closing in the fourth quarter of 2005, required Berkshire to record a\n$5.0 billion pre-tax capital gain. This bookkeeping entry, dictated by GAAP, is meaningless from an\neconomic standpoint, and you should ignore it when you are evaluating Berkshire’s 2005 earnings. We\ndidn’t intend to sell our Gillette shares before the merger; we don’t intend to sell our P&G shares now; and\nwe incurred no tax when the merger took place.\nIt’s hard to overemphasize the importance of who is CEO of a company. Before Jim Kilts arrived\nat Gillette in 2001, the company was struggling, having particularly suffered from capital-allocation\nblunders. In the major example, Gillette’s acquisition of Duracell cost Gillette shareholders billions of\ndollars, a loss never made visible by conventional accounting. Quite simply, what Gillette received in\nbusiness value in this acquisition was not equivalent to what it gave up. (Amazingly, this most\nfundamental of yardsticks is almost always ignored by both managements and their investment bankers\nwhen acquisitions are under discussion.)\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nUpon taking office at Gillette, Jim quickly instilled fiscal discipline, tightened operations and\nenergized marketing, moves that dramatically increased the intrinsic value of the company. Gillette’s\nmerger with P&G then expanded the potential of both companies. For his accomplishments, Jim was paid\nvery well – but he earned every penny. (This is no academic evaluation: As a 9.7% owner of Gillette,\nBerkshire in effect paid that proportion of his compensation.) Indeed, it’s difficult to overpay the truly\nextraordinary CEO of a giant enterprise. But this species is rare.\nToo often, executive compensation in the U. S. is ridiculously out of line with performance. That\nwon’t change, moreover, because the deck is stacked against investors when it comes to the CEO’s pay.\nThe upshot is that a mediocre-or-worse CEO – aided by his handpicked VP of human relations and a\nconsultant from the ever-accommodating firm of Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo – all too often receives gobs\nof money from an ill-designed compensation arrangement.\nTake, for instance, ten year, fixed-price options (and who wouldn’t?). If Fred Futile, CEO of\nStagnant, Inc., receives a bundle of these – let’s say enough to give him an option on 1% of the company –\nhis self-interest is clear: He should skip dividends entirely and instead use all of the company’s earnings to\nrepurchase stock.\nLet’s assume that under Fred’s leadership Stagnant lives up to its name. In each of the ten years\nafter the option grant, it earns $1 billion on $10 billion of net worth, which initially comes to $10 per share\non the 100 million shares then outstanding. Fred eschews dividends and regularly uses all earnings to\nrepurchase shares. If the stock constantly sells at ten times earnings per share, it will have appreciated\n158% by the end of the option period. That’s because repurchases would reduce the number of shares to\n38.7 million by that time, and earnings per share would thereby increase to $25.80. Simply by withholding\nearnings from owners, Fred gets very rich, making a cool $158 million, despite the business itself\nimproving not at all. Astonishingly, Fred could have made more than $100 million if Stagnant’s earnings\nhad declined by 20% during the ten-year period.\nFred can also get a splendid result for himself by paying no dividends and deploying the earnings\nhe withholds from shareholders into a variety of disappointing projects and acquisitions. Even if these\ninitiatives deliver a paltry 5% return, Fred will still make a bundle. Specifically – with Stagnant’s p/e ratio\nremaining unchanged at ten – Fred’s option will deliver him $63 million. Meanwhile, his shareholders will\nwonder what happened to the “alignment of interests” that was supposed to occur when Fred was issued\noptions.\nA “normal” dividend policy, of course – one-third of earnings paid out, for example – produces\nless extreme results but still can provide lush rewards for managers who achieve nothing.\nCEOs understand this math and know that every dime paid out in dividends reduces the value of\nall outstanding options. I’ve never, however, seen this manager-owner conflict referenced in proxy\nmaterials that request approval of a fixed-priced option plan. Though CEOs invariably preach internally\nthat capital comes at a cost, they somehow forget to tell shareholders that fixed-price options give them\ncapital that is free.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way: It’s child’s play for a board to design options that give effect to the\nautomatic build-up in value that occurs when earnings are retained. But – surprise, surprise – options of\nthat kind are almost never issued. Indeed, the very thought of options with strike prices that are adjusted\nfor retained earnings seems foreign to compensation “experts,” who are nevertheless encyclopedic about\nevery management-friendly plan that exists. (“Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.”)\nGetting fired can produce a particularly bountiful payday for a CEO. Indeed, he can “earn” more\nin that single day, while cleaning out his desk, than an American worker earns in a lifetime of cleaning\ntoilets. Forget the old maxim about nothing succeeding like success: Today, in the executive suite, the alltoo-prevalent rule is that nothing succeeds like failure.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nHuge severance payments, lavish perks and outsized payments for ho-hum performance often\noccur because comp committees have become slaves to comparative data. The drill is simple: Three or so\ndirectors – not chosen by chance – are bombarded for a few hours before a board meeting with pay\nstatistics that perpetually ratchet upwards. Additionally, the committee is told about new perks that other\nmanagers are receiving. In this manner, outlandish “goodies” are showered upon CEOs simply because of\na corporate version of the argument we all used when children: “But, Mom, all the other kids have one.”\nWhen comp committees follow this “logic,” yesterday’s most egregious excess becomes today’s baseline.\nComp committees should adopt the attitude of Hank Greenberg, the Detroit slugger and a boyhood\nhero of mine. Hank’s son, Steve, at one time was a player’s agent. Representing an outfielder in\nnegotiations with a major league club, Steve sounded out his dad about the size of the signing bonus he\nshould ask for. Hank, a true pay-for-performance guy, got straight to the point, “What did he hit last year?”\nWhen Steve answered “. 246,” Hank’s comeback was immediate: “Ask for a uniform.”\n(Let me pause for a brief confession: In criticizing comp committee behavior, I don’t speak as a\ntrue insider. Though I have served as a director of twenty public companies, only one CEO has put me on\nhis comp committee. Hmmmm . . .)",

When we have a long-term position in stocks or bonds, year-to-year changes in\nvalue are reflected in our balance sheet but, as long as the asset is not sold, are rarely reflected in earnings.\nFor example, our Coca-Cola holdings went from $1 billion in value early on to $13.4 billion at yearend\n1998 and have since declined to $8.1 billion – with none of these moves affecting our earnings statement.\nLong-term currency positions, however, are daily marked to market and therefore have an effect on\nearnings in every reporting period. From the date we first entered into currency contracts, we are $2.0\nbillion in the black.\nWe reduced our direct position in currencies somewhat during 2005. We partially offset this\nchange, however, by purchasing equities whose prices are denominated in a variety of foreign currencies\nand that earn a large part of their profits internationally. Charlie and I prefer this method of acquiring nondollar exposure. That’s largely because of changes in interest rates: As U. S. rates have risen relative to\nthose of the rest of the world, holding most foreign currencies now involves a significant negative “carry.”\nThe carry aspect of our direct currency position indeed cost us money in 2005 and is likely to do so again in\n2006. In contrast, the ownership of foreign equities is likely, over time, to create a positive carry – perhaps\na substantial one.\nThe underlying factors affecting the U. S. current account deficit continue to worsen, and no letup\nis in sight. Not only did our trade deficit – the largest and most familiar item in the current account – hit an\nall-time high in 2005, but we also can expect a second item – the balance of investment income – to soon\nturn negative. As foreigners increase their ownership of U. S. assets (or of claims against us) relative to\nU. S. investments abroad, these investors will begin earning more on their holdings than we do on ours.\nFinally, the third component of the current account, unilateral transfers, is always negative.\nThe U. S., it should be emphasized, is extraordinarily rich and will get richer. As a result, the huge\nimbalances in its current account may continue for a long time without their having noticeable deleterious\neffects on the U. S. economy or on markets. I doubt, however, that the situation will forever remain benign.\nEither Americans address the problem soon in a way we select, or at some point the problem will likely\naddress us in an unpleasant way of its own.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n",

    "content": "\nHow to Minimize Investment Returns\nIt’s been an easy matter for Berkshire and other owners of American equities to prosper over the\nyears. Between December 31,1899 and December 31,1999, to give a really long-term example, the Dow\nrose from 66 to 11,497. (Guess what annual growth rate is required to produce this result; the surprising\nanswer is at the end of this section.) This huge rise came about for a simple reason: Over the century\nAmerican businesses did extraordinarily well and investors rode the wave of their prosperity. Businesses\ncontinue to do well. But now shareholders, through a series of self-inflicted wounds, are in a major way\ncutting the returns they will realize from their investments.\nThe explanation of how this is happening begins with a fundamental truth: With unimportant\nexceptions, such as bankruptcies in which some of a company’s losses are borne by creditors, the most that\nowners in aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their businesses in aggregate earn.\nTrue, by buying and selling that is clever or lucky, investor A may take more than his share of the pie at the\nexpense of investor B. And, yes, all investors feel richer when stocks soar. But an owner can exit only by\nhaving someone take his place. If one investor sells high, another must buy high. For owners as a whole,\nthere is simply no magic – no shower of money from outer space – that will enable them to extract wealth\nfrom their companies beyond that created by the companies themselves.\nIndeed, owners must earn less than their businesses earn because of “frictional” costs. And that’s\nmy point: These costs are now being incurred in amounts that will cause shareholders to earn far less than\nthey historically have.\nTo understand how this toll has ballooned, imagine for a moment that all American corporations\nare, and always will be, owned by a single family. We’ll call them the Gotrocks. After paying taxes on\ndividends, this family – generation after generation – becomes richer by the aggregate amount earned by its\ncompanies. Today that amount is about $700 billion annually. Naturally, the family spends some of these\ndollars. But the portion it saves steadily compounds for its benefit. In the Gotrocks household everyone\ngrows wealthier at the same pace, and all is harmonious.\nBut let’s now assume that a few fast-talking Helpers approach the family and persuade each of its\nmembers to try to outsmart his relatives by buying certain of their holdings and selling them certain others.\nThe Helpers – for a fee, of course – obligingly agree to handle these transactions. The Gotrocks still own\nall of corporate America; the trades just rearrange who owns what. So the family’s annual gain in wealth\ndiminishes, equaling the earnings of American business minus commissions paid. The more that family\nmembers trade, the smaller their share of the pie and the larger the slice received by the Helpers. This fact\nis not lost upon these broker-Helpers: Activity is their friend and, in a wide variety of ways, they urge it on.\nAfter a while, most of the family members realize that they are not doing so well at this new “beatmy-brother” game. Enter another set of Helpers. These newcomers explain to each member of the\nGotrocks clan that by himself he’ll never outsmart the rest of the family. The suggested cure: “Hire a\nmanager – yes, us – and get the job done professionally.” These manager-Helpers continue to use the\nbroker-Helpers to execute trades; the managers may even increase their activity so as to permit the brokers\nto prosper still more. Overall, a bigger slice of the pie now goes to the two classes of Helpers.\nThe family’s disappointment grows. Each of its members is now employing professionals. Yet\noverall, the group’s finances have taken a turn for the worse. The solution? More help, of course.\nIt arrives in the form of financial planners and institutional consultants, who weigh in to advise the\nGotrocks on selecting manager-Helpers. The befuddled family welcomes this assistance. By now its\nmembers know they can pick neither the right stocks nor the right stock-pickers. Why, one might ask,\nshould they expect success in picking the right consultant? But this question does not occur to the\nGotrocks, and the consultant-Helpers certainly don’t suggest it to them.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nThe Gotrocks, now supporting three classes of expensive Helpers, find that their results get worse,\nand they sink into despair. But just as hope seems lost, a fourth group – we’ll call them the hyper-Helpers\n• appears. These friendly folk explain to the Gotrocks that their unsatisfactory results are occurring\nbecause the existing Helpers – brokers, managers, consultants – are not sufficiently motivated and are\nsimply going through the motions. “What,” the new Helpers ask, “can you expect from such a bunch of\nzombies?”\nThe new arrivals offer a breathtakingly simple solution: Pay more money. Brimming with selfconfidence, the hyper-Helpers assert that huge contingent payments – in addition to stiff fixed fees – are\nwhat each family member must fork over in order to really outmaneuver his relatives.\nThe more observant members of the family see that some of the hyper-Helpers are really just\nmanager-Helpers wearing new uniforms, bearing sewn-on sexy names like HEDGE FUND or PRIVATE\nEQUITY. The new Helpers, however, assure the Gotrocks that this change of clothing is all-important,\nbestowing on its wearers magical powers similar to those acquired by mild-mannered Clark Kent when he\nchanged into his Superman costume. Calmed by this explanation, the family decides to pay up.\nAnd that’s where we are today: A record portion of the earnings that would go in their entirety to\nowners – if they all just stayed in their rocking chairs – is now going to a swelling army of Helpers.\nParticularly expensive is the recent pandemic of profit arrangements under which Helpers receive large\nportions of the winnings when they are smart or lucky, and leave family members with all of the losses –\nand large fixed fees to boot – when the Helpers are dumb or unlucky (or occasionally crooked).\nA sufficient number of arrangements like this – heads, the Helper takes much of the winnings;\ntails, the Gotrocks lose and pay dearly for the privilege of doing so – may make it more accurate to call the\nfamily the Hadrocks. Today, in fact, the family’s frictional costs of all sorts may well amount to 20% of\nthe earnings of American business. In other words, the burden of paying Helpers may cause American\nequity investors, overall, to earn only 80% or so of what they would earn if they just sat still and listened to\nno one.\nLong ago, Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius. But Sir\nIsaac’s talents didn’t extend to investing: He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble, explaining later, “I can\ncalculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.” If he had not been traumatized by this\nloss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion: For investors as a whole,\nreturns decrease as motion increases.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nHere’s the answer to the question posed at the beginning of this section: To get very specific, the\nDow increased from 65.73 to 11,497.12 in the 20 th century, and that amounts to a gain of 5.3%\ncompounded annually. (Investors would also have received dividends, of course.) To achieve an equal rate\nof gain in the 21 st century, the Dow will have to rise by December 31,2099 to – brace yourself – precisely\n2,011,011.23. But I’m willing to settle for 2,000,000; six years into this century, the Dow has gained not at\nall.",

    "content": "\nDebt and Risk\nAs we consolidate Mid American, our new balance sheet may suggest that Berkshire has expanded\nits tolerance for borrowing. But that’s not so. Except for token amounts, we shun debt, turning to it for\nonly three purposes:\n1) We occasionally use repos as a part of certain short-term investing strategies that incorporate\nownership of U. S. government (or agency) securities. Purchases of this kind are highly\nopportunistic and involve only the most liquid of securities. A few years ago, we entered into\nseveral interesting transactions that have since been unwound or are running off. The offsetting\ndebt has likewise been cut substantially and before long may be gone.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\n2) We borrow money against portfolios of interest-bearing receivables whose risk characteristics we\nunderstand. We did this in 2001 when we guaranteed $5.6 billion of bank debt to take over, in\npartnership with Leucadia, a bankrupt Finova (which held a broad range of receivables). All of\nthat debt has been repaid. More recently, we have borrowed to finance a widely-diversified,\npredictably-performing portfolio of manufactured-home receivables managed by Clayton.\nAlternatively, we could “securitize” – that is, sell – these receivables, but retain the servicing of\nthem. If we followed this procedure, which is common in the industry, we would not show the\ndebt that we do on our balance sheet, and we would also accelerate the earnings we report. In the\nend, however, we would earn less money. Were market variables to change so as to favor\nsecuritization (an unlikely event), we could sell part of our portfolio and eliminate the related debt.\nUntil then, we prefer better profits to better cosmetics.\n3) At Mid American, we have substantial debt, but it is that company’s obligation only. Though it\nwill appear on our consolidated balance sheet, Berkshire does not guarantee it.\nEven so, this debt is unquestionably secure because it is serviced by Mid American’s diversified\nstream of highly-stable utility earnings. If there were to be some bolt from the blue that hurt one\nof Mid American’s utility properties, earnings from the others would still be more than ample to\ncover all debt requirements. Moreover, Mid American retains all of its earnings, an equitybuilding practice that is rare in the utility field.\nFrom a risk standpoint, it is far safer to have earnings from ten diverse and uncorrelated utility\noperations that cover interest charges by, say, a 2: 1 ratio than it is to have far greater coverage\nprovided by a single utility. A catastrophic event can render a single utility insolvent – witness\nwhat Katrina did to the local electric utility in New Orleans – no matter how conservative its debt\npolicy. A geographical disaster – say, an earthquake in a Western state – can’t have the same\neffect on Mid American. And even a worrier like Charlie can’t think of an event that would\nsystemically decrease utility earnings in any major way. Because of Mid American’s everwidening diversity of regulated earnings, it will always utilize major amounts of debt.\nAnd that’s about it. We are not interested in incurring any significant debt at Berkshire for\nacquisitions or operating purposes. Conventional business wisdom, of course, would argue that we are\nbeing too conservative and that there are added profits that could be safely earned if we injected moderate\nleverage into our balance sheet.\nMaybe so. But many of Berkshire’s hundreds of thousands of investors have a large portion of\ntheir net worth in our stock (among them, it should be emphasized, a large number of our board and key\nmanagers) and a disaster for the company would be a disaster for them. Moreover, there are people who\nhave been permanently injured to whom we owe insurance payments that stretch out for fifty years or\nmore. To these and other constituencies we have promised total security, whatever comes: financial panics,\nstock-exchange closures (an extended one occurred in 1914) or even domestic nuclear, chemical or\nbiological attacks.\nWe are quite willing to accept huge risks. Indeed, more than any other insurer, we write high-limit\npolicies that are tied to single catastrophic events. We also own a large investment portfolio whose market\nvalue could fall dramatically and quickly under certain conditions (as happened on October 19,1987).\nWhatever occurs, though, Berkshire will have the net worth, the earnings streams and the liquidity to\nhandle the problem with ease.\nAny other approach is dangerous. Over the years, a number of very smart people have learned the\nhard way that a long string of impressive numbers multiplied by a single zero always equals zero. That is\nnot an equation whose effects I would like to experience personally, and I would like even less to be\nresponsible for imposing its penalties upon others.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n",

You also want to know what happens if I\nshould die tonight.\nThat second question is easy to answer. Most of our many businesses have strong market\npositions, significant momentum, and terrific managers. The special Berkshire culture is deeply ingrained\nthroughout our subsidiaries, and these operations won’t miss a beat when I die.\nMoreover, we have three managers at Berkshire who are reasonably young and fully capable of\nbeing CEO. Any of the three would be much better at certain management aspects of my job than I. On\nthe minus side, none has my crossover experience that allows me to be comfortable making decisions in\neither the business arena or in investments. That problem will be solved by having another person in the\norganization handle marketable securities. That’s an interesting job at Berkshire, and the new CEO will\nhave no problem in hiring a talented individual to do it. Indeed, that’s what we have done at GEICO for 26\nyears, and our results have been terrific.\nBerkshire’s board has fully discussed each of the three CEO candidates and has unanimously\nagreed on the person who should succeed me if a replacement were needed today. The directors stay\nupdated on this subject and could alter their view as circumstances change – new managerial stars may\nemerge and present ones will age. The important point is that the directors know now – and will always\nknow in the future – exactly what they will do when the need arises.\nThe other question that must be addressed is whether the Board will be prepared to make a change\nif that need should arise not from my death but rather from my decay, particularly if this decay is\naccompanied by my delusionally thinking that I am reaching new peaks of managerial brilliance. That\nproblem would not be unique to me. Charlie and I have faced this situation from time to time at\nBerkshire’s subsidiaries. Humans age at greatly varying rates – but sooner or later their talents and vigor\ndecline. Some managers remain effective well into their 80 s – Charlie is a wonder at 82 – and others\nnoticeably fade in their 60 s. When their abilities ebb, so usually do their powers of self-assessment.\nSomeone else often needs to blow the whistle.\nWhen that time comes for me, our board will have to step up to the job. From a financial\nstandpoint, its members are unusually motivated to do so. I know of no other board in the country in which\nthe financial interests of directors are so completely aligned with those of shareholders. Few boards even\ncome close. On a personal level, however, it is extraordinarily difficult for most people to tell someone,\nparticularly a friend, that he or she is no longer capable.\nIf I become a candidate for that message, however, our board will be doing me a favor by\ndelivering it. Every share of Berkshire that I own is destined to go to philanthropies, and I want society to\nreap the maximum good from these gifts and bequests. It would be a tragedy if the philanthropic potential\nof my holdings was diminished because my associates shirked their responsibility to (tenderly, I hope)\nshow me the door. But don’t worry about this. We have an outstanding group of directors, and they will\nalways do what’s right for shareholders.\nAnd while we are on the subject, I feel terrific.",

    "content": "\nThe Annual Meeting\nOur meeting this year will be on Saturday, May 6. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest\nCenter at 7 a. m., and the latest Berkshire movie will be shown at 8: 30. At 9: 30 we will go directly to the\nquestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3: 00. Then,\nafter a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3: 15. This schedule worked well last\nyear, because it let those who wanted to attend the formal session to do so, while freeing others to shop.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nYou certainly did your share in this respect last year. The 194,300 square foot hall adjoining the\nmeeting area was filled with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries, and the 21,000 people who came to the\nmeeting allowed every location to rack up sales records. Kelly Broz (neé Muchemore), the Flo Ziegfeld of\nBerkshire, orchestrates both this magnificent shopping extravaganza and the meeting itself. The exhibitors\nlove her, and so do I. Kelly got married in October, and I gave her away. She asked me how I wanted to\nbe listed in the wedding program. I replied “envious of the groom,” and that’s the way it went to press.\nThis year we will showcase two Clayton homes (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns\nManville insulation, Mi Tek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture). You will find that these\nhomes, priced at $79,000 and $89,000, deliver excellent value. In fact, three shareholders came so firmly\nto that conclusion last year that they bought the $119,000 model we then showcased. Flanking the Clayton\nhomes on the exhibition floor will be RVs from Forest River.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as\nthat given certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save\nyou money. For at least 50% of you, I believe we can. And while you’re at it, sign up for the new GEICO\ncredit card. It’s the one I now use.\nOn Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from Net Jets®\navailable for your inspection. Stop by the Net Jets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.\nCome to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane.\nThe Bookworm boutique at the Qwest broke all records last year selling Berkshire-related books.\nAn amazing 3,500 of these were Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the collected wisdom of my partner. This\nmeans that a copy was sold every 9 seconds. And for good reason: You will never find a book with more\nuseful ideas. Word-of-mouth recommendations have caused Charlie’s first printing of 20,500 copies to sell\nout, and we will therefore have a revised and expanded edition on sale at our meeting. Among the other 22\ntitles and DVDs available last year at the Bookworm, 4,597 copies were sold for $84,746. Our\nshareholders are a bookseller’s dream.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain\nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol\nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific,\nwe will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM nine years\nago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $27.4 million in 2005 (up 9% from\na year earlier). I get goose bumps just thinking about this volume.\nTo obtain the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 4 and Monday,\nMay 8 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to\nthe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but\nthat, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their\ncooperation. NFM is open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on\nSunday. On Saturday this year, from 5: 30 p. m. to 8 p. m., we are having a special affair for shareholders\nonly. I’ll be there, eating barbeque, drinking Coke, and counting sales.\nBorsheim’s again will have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p. m. to 10 p. m. on Friday, May 5. The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m. on\nSunday, May 7. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p. m.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheim’s throughout the weekend. For your convenience,\ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, May 1 through Saturday, May 13. During\nthat period, just identify yourself as a shareholder through your meeting credentials or a brokerage\nstatement.\nBorsheim’s operates on a gross margin that, even before the shareholders’ discount, is fully twenty\npercentage points below that of its major rivals. Last year, our shareholder-period business increased 9%\nfrom 2004, which came on top of a 73% gain the year before. The store sold 5,000 Berkshire Monopoly\ngames – and then ran out. We’ve learned: Plenty will be in stock this year.\nIn a tent outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick Wolff, twice U. S. chess champion, will take on all comers\nin groups of six – blindfolded. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the\nworld’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. They plan to keep\ntheir eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, even when playing for a national championship.\nGorat’s – my favorite steakhouse – will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on\nSunday, May 7, and will be serving from 4 p. m. until 10 p. m. Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on\nthat day, you must have a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before).\nIn this school year, about 35 university classes will come to Omaha for sessions with me. I take\nalmost all – in aggregate, perhaps 2,000 students – to lunch at Gorat’s. And they love it. To learn why,\ncome join us on Sunday.\nWe will again have a special reception from 4: 00 to 5: 30 on Saturday afternoon for shareholders\nwho have come from outside of North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around\nthe globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we\nenjoyed meeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries. Any shareholder who comes from\nother than the U. S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this function.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I are extraordinarily lucky. We were born in America; had terrific parents who saw\nthat we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a\n“business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to other people who\ncontribute as much or more to our society’s well-being. Moreover, we have long had jobs that we love, in\nwhich we are helped every day in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. No wonder we tapdance to work. But nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at\nBerkshire’s annual meeting. So join us on May 6 th at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.\nWe’ll see you there.\nFebruary 28,2006 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
