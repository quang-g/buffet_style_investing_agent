    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nFebruary 26,1982\n\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOperating earnings of $39.7 million in 1981 amounted to\n15.2% of beginning equity capital (valuing securities at cost)\ncompared to 17.8% in 1980. Our new plan that allows stockholders\nto designate corporate charitable contributions (detailed later)\nreduced earnings by about $900,000 in 1981. This program, which\nwe expect to continue subject to annual evaluation of our\ncorporate tax position, had not been initiated in 1980.\n\nNon-Controlled Ownership Earnings\n\nIn the 1980 annual report we discussed extensively the\nconcept of non-controlled ownership earnings, i. e., Berkshires\nshare of the undistributed earnings of companies we dont control\nor significantly influence but in which we, nevertheless, have\nimportant investments. (We will be glad to make available to new\nor prospective shareholders copies of that discussion or others\nfrom earlier reports to which we refer in this report.) No\nportion of those undistributed earnings is included in the\noperating earnings of Berkshire.\n\nHowever, our belief is that, in aggregate, those\nundistributed and, therefore, unrecorded earnings will be\ntranslated into tangible value for Berkshire shareholders just as\nsurely as if subsidiaries we control had earned, retained - and\nreported - similar earnings.\n\nWe know that this translation of non-controlled ownership\nearnings into corresponding realized and unrealized capital gains\nfor Berkshire will be extremely irregular as to time of\noccurrence. While market values track business values quite well\nover long periods, in any given year the relationship can gyrate\ncapriciously. Market recognition of retained earnings also will\nbe unevenly realized among companies. It will be disappointingly\nlow or negative in cases where earnings are employed nonproductively, and far greater than dollar-for-dollar of retained\nearnings in cases of companies that achieve high returns with\ntheir augmented capital. Overall, if a group of non-controlled\ncompanies is selected with reasonable skill, the group result\nshould be quite satisfactory.\n\nIn aggregate, our non-controlled business interests have\nmore favorable underlying economic characteristics than our\ncontrolled businesses. Thats understandable; the area of choice\nhas been far wider. Small portions of exceptionally good\nbusinesses are usually available in the securities markets at\nreasonable prices. But such businesses are available for\npurchase in their entirety only rarely, and then almost always at\nhigh prices.\n\n",

    "content": "General Acquisition Behavior\n\nAs our history indicates, we are comfortable both with total\nownership of businesses and with marketable securities\nrepresenting small portions of businesses. We continually look\nfor ways to employ large sums in each area. (But we try to avoid\nsmall commitments - If somethings not worth doing at all, its\nnot worth doing well.) Indeed, the liquidity requirements of our\ninsurance and trading stamp businesses mandate major investments\nin marketable securities.\n\nOur acquisition decisions will be aimed at maximizing real\neconomic benefits, not at maximizing either managerial domain or\nreported numbers for accounting purposes. (In the long run,\nmanagements stressing accounting appearance over economic\nsubstance usually achieve little of either.)\n\nRegardless of the impact upon immediately reportable\nearnings, we would rather buy 10% of Wonderful Business T at X\nper share than 100% of T at 2 X per share. Most corporate\nmanagers prefer just the reverse, and have no shortage of stated\nrationales for their behavior.\n\nHowever, we suspect three motivations - usually unspoken -\nto be, singly or in combination, the important ones in most highpremium takeovers:\n\n(1) Leaders, business or otherwise, seldom are deficient in\nanimal spirits and often relish increased activity and\nchallenge. At Berkshire, the corporate pulse never\nbeats faster than when an acquisition is in prospect.\n\n(2) Most organizations, business or otherwise, measure\nthemselves, are measured by others, and compensate their\nmanagers far more by the yardstick of size than by any\nother yardstick. (Ask a\nFortune 500\nmanager where his\ncorporation stands on that famous list and, invariably,\nthe number responded will be from the list ranked by\nsize of sales; he may well not even know where his\ncorporation places on the list\nFortune\njust as\nfaithfully compiles ranking the same 500 corporations by\nprofitability.)\n\n(3) Many managements apparently were overexposed in\nimpressionable childhood years to the story in which the\nimprisoned handsome prince is released from a toads\nbody by a kiss from a beautiful princess. Consequently,\nthey are certain their managerial kiss will do wonders\nfor the profitability of Company T(arget).\n\nSuch optimism is essential. Absent that rosy view,\nwhy else should the shareholders of Company A(cquisitor)\nwant to own an interest in T at the 2 X takeover cost\nrather than at the X market price they would pay if they\nmade direct purchases on their own?\n\nIn other words, investors can always buy toads at the\ngoing price for toads. If investors instead bankroll\nprincesses who wish to pay double for the right to kiss\nthe toad, those kisses had better pack some real\ndynamite. Weve observed many kisses but very few\nmiracles. Nevertheless, many managerial princesses\nremain serenely confident about the future potency of\ntheir kisses - even after their corporate backyards are\nknee-deep in unresponsive toads.\n\nIn fairness, we should acknowledge that some acquisition\nrecords have been dazzling. Two major categories stand out.\n\nThe first involves companies that, through design or\naccident, have purchased only businesses that are particularly\nwell adapted to an inflationary environment. Such favored\nbusiness must have two characteristics: (1) an ability to\nincrease prices rather easily (even when product demand is flat\nand capacity is not fully utilized) without fear of significant\nloss of either market share or unit volume, and (2) an ability to\naccommodate large dollar volume increases in business (often\nproduced more by inflation than by real growth) with only minor\nadditional investment of capital. Managers of ordinary ability,\nfocusing solely on acquisition possibilities meeting these tests,\nhave achieved excellent results in recent decades. However, very\nfew enterprises possess both characteristics, and competition to\nbuy those that do has now become fierce to the point of being\nself-defeating.\n\nThe second category involves the managerial superstars - men\nwho can recognize that rare prince who is disguised as a toad,\nand who have managerial abilities that enable them to peel away\nthe disguise. We salute such managers as Ben Heineman at\nNorthwest Industries, Henry Singleton at Teledyne, Erwin Zaban at\nNational Service Industries, and especially Tom Murphy at Capital\nCities Communications (a real managerial twofer, whose\nacquisition efforts have been properly focused in Category 1 and\nwhose operating talents also make him a leader of Category 2).\nFrom both direct and vicarious experience, we recognize the\ndifficulty and rarity of these executives achievements. (So do\nthey; these champs have made very few deals in recent years, and\noften have found repurchase of their own shares to be the most\nsensible employment of corporate capital.)\n\nYour Chairman, unfortunately, does not qualify for Category\n2. And, despite a reasonably good understanding of the economic\nfactors compelling concentration in Category 1, our actual\nacquisition activity in that category has been sporadic and\ninadequate. Our preaching was better than our performance. (We\nneglected the Noah principle: predicting rain doesnt count,\nbuilding arks does.)\n\nWe have tried occasionally to buy toads at bargain prices\nwith results that have been chronicled in past reports. Clearly\nour kisses fell flat. We have done well with a couple of princes\n- but they were princes when purchased. At least our kisses\ndidnt turn them into toads. And, finally, we have occasionally\nbeen quite successful in purchasing fractional interests in\neasily-identifiable princes at toad-like prices.\n\n",

    "content": "Berkshire Acquisition Objectives\n\nWe will continue to seek the acquisition of businesses in\ntheir entirety at prices that will make sense, even should the\nfuture of the acquired enterprise develop much along the lines of\nits past. We may very well pay a fairly fancy price for a\nCategory 1 business if we are reasonably confident of what we are\ngetting. But we will not normally pay a lot in any purchase for\nwhat we are supposed to bring to the party - for we find that we\nordinarily dont bring a lot.\n\nDuring 1981 we came quite close to a major purchase\ninvolving both a business and a manager we liked very much.\nHowever, the price finally demanded, considering alternative uses\nfor the funds involved, would have left our owners worse off than\nbefore the purchase. The empire would have been larger, but the\ncitizenry would have been poorer.\n\nAlthough we had no success in 1981, from time to time in the\nfuture we will be able to purchase 100% of businesses meeting our\nstandards. Additionally, we expect an occasional offering of a\nmajor non-voting partnership as discussed under the Pinkertons\nheading on page 47 of this report. We welcome suggestions\nregarding such companies where we, as a substantial junior\npartner, can achieve good economic results while furthering the\nlong-term objectives of present owners and managers.\n\nCurrently, we find values most easily obtained through the\nopen-market purchase of fractional positions in companies with\nexcellent business franchises and competent, honest managements.\nWe never expect to run these companies, but we do expect to\nprofit from them.\n\nWe expect that undistributed earnings from such companies\nwill produce full value (subject to tax when realized) for\nBerkshire and its shareholders. If they dont, we have made\nmistakes as to either: (1) the management we have elected to\njoin; (2) the future economics of the business; or (3) the price\nwe have paid.\n\nWe have made plenty of such mistakes - both in the purchase\nof non-controlling and controlling interests in businesses.\nCategory (2) miscalculations are the most common. Of course, it\nis necessary to dig deep into our history to find illustrations\nof such mistakes - sometimes as deep as two or three months back.\nFor example, last year your Chairman volunteered his expert\nopinion on the rosy future of the aluminum business. Several\nminor adjustments to that opinion - now aggregating approximately\n180 degrees - have since been required.\n\nFor personal as well as more objective reasons, however, we\ngenerally have been able to correct such mistakes far more\nquickly in the case of non-controlled businesses (marketable\nsecurities) than in the case of controlled subsidiaries. Lack of\ncontrol, in effect, often has turned out to be an economic plus.\n\nAs we mentioned last year, the magnitude of our non-recorded\nownership earnings has grown to the point where their total is\ngreater than our reported operating earnings. We expect this\nsituation will continue. In just four ownership positions in\nthis category - GEICO Corporation, General Foods Corporation, R.\nJ. Reynolds Industries, Inc. and The Washington Post Company -\nour share of undistributed and therefore unrecorded earnings\nprobably will total well over $35 million in 1982. The\naccounting rules that entirely ignore these undistributed\nearnings diminish the utility of our annual return on equity\ncalculation, or any other single year measure of economic\nperformance.\n\n",

If we are correct in\nthe premise stressed in the preceding section of this report, our\nunreported ownership earnings will find their way, irregularly\nbut inevitably, into our net worth. To date, this has been the\ncase.\n\nAn even purer calculation of performance would involve a\nvaluation of bonds and non-insurance held equities at market.\nHowever, GAAP accounting does not prescribe this procedure, and\nthe added purity would change results only very slightly. Should\nany valuation difference widen to significant proportions, as it\nhas at most major insurance companies, we will report its effect\nto you.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, during the present managements term of\nseventeen years, book value has increased from $19.46 per share\nto $526.02 per share, or 21.1% compounded annually. This rate of\nreturn number is highly likely to drift downward in future years.\nWe hope, however, that it can be maintained significantly above\nthe rate of return achieved by the average large American\ncorporation.\n\nOver half of the large gain in Berkshires net worth during\n1981 - it totaled $124 million, or about 31% - resulted from the\nmarket performance of a single investment, GEICO Corporation. In\naggregate, our market gain from securities during the year\nconsiderably outstripped the gain in underlying business values.\nSuch market variations will not always be on the pleasant side.\n\nIn past reports we have explained how inflation has caused\nour apparently satisfactory long-term corporate performance to be\nillusory as a measure of true investment results for our owners.\nWe applaud the efforts of Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker and\nnote the currently more moderate increases in various price\nindices. Nevertheless, our views regarding long-term\ninflationary trends are as negative as ever. Like virginity, a\nstable price level seems capable of maintenance, but not of\nrestoration.\n\nDespite the overriding importance of inflation in the\ninvestment equation, we will not punish you further with another\nfull recital of our views; inflation itself will be punishment\nenough. (Copies of previous discussions are available for\nmasochists.) But, because of the unrelenting destruction of\ncurrency values, our corporate efforts will continue to do a much\nbetter job of filling your wallet than of filling your stomach.\n\n",

    "content": "Equity Value-Added\n\nAn additional factor should further subdue any residual\nenthusiasm you may retain regarding our long-term rate of return.\nThe economic case justifying equity investment is that, in\naggregate, additional earnings above passive investment returns -\ninterest on fixed-income securities - will be derived through the\nemployment of managerial and entrepreneurial skills in\nconjunction with that equity capital. Furthermore, the case says\nthat since the equity capital position is associated with greater\nrisk than passive forms of investment, it is entitled to higher\nreturns. A value-added bonus from equity capital seems natural\nand certain.\n\nBut is it? Several decades back, a return on equity of as\nlittle as 10% enabled a corporation to be classified as a good\nbusiness - i. e., one in which a dollar reinvested in the business\nlogically could be expected to be valued by the market at more\nthan one hundred cents. For, with long-term taxable bonds\nyielding 5% and long-term tax-exempt bonds 3%, a business\noperation that could utilize equity capital at 10% clearly was\nworth some premium to investors over the equity capital employed.\nThat was true even though a combination of taxes on dividends and\non capital gains would reduce the 10% earned by the corporation\nto perhaps 6%-8% in the hands of the individual investor.\n\nInvestment markets recognized this truth. During that\nearlier period, American business earned an average of 11% or so\non equity capital employed and stocks, in aggregate, sold at\nvaluations far above that equity capital (book value), averaging\nover 150 cents on the dollar. Most businesses were good\nbusinesses because they earned far more than their keep (the\nreturn on long-term passive money). The value-added produced by\nequity investment, in aggregate, was substantial.\n\nThat day is gone. But the lessons learned during its\nexistence are difficult to discard. While investors and managers\nmust place their feet in the future, their memories and nervous\nsystems often remain plugged into the past. It is much easier\nfor investors to utilize historic p/e ratios or for managers to\nutilize historic business valuation yardsticks than it is for\neither group to rethink their premises daily. When change is\nslow, constant rethinking is actually undesirable; it achieves\nlittle and slows response time. But when change is great,\nyesterdays assumptions can be retained only at great cost. And\nthe pace of economic change has become breathtaking.\n\nDuring the past year, long-term taxable bond yields exceeded\n16% and long-term tax-exempts 14%. The total return achieved\nfrom such tax-exempts, of course, goes directly into the pocket\nof the individual owner. Meanwhile, American business is\nproducing earnings of only about 14% on equity. And this 14%\nwill be substantially reduced by taxation before it can be banked\nby the individual owner. The extent of such shrinkage depends\nupon the dividend policy of the corporation and the tax rates\napplicable to the investor.\n\nThus,\nwith interest rates on passive investments at late\n1981 levels,\na typical American business is no longer worth one\nhundred cents on the dollar to owners who are individuals. (If\nthe business is owned by pension funds or other tax-exempt\ninvestors, the arithmetic, although still unenticing, changes\nsubstantially for the better.) Assume an investor in a 50% tax\nbracket; if our typical company pays out all earnings, the income\nreturn to the investor will be equivalent to that from a 7% taxexempt bond. And, if conditions persist - if all earnings are\npaid out and return on equity stays at 14% - the 7% tax-exempt\nequivalent to the higher-bracket individual investor is just as\nfrozen as is the coupon on a tax-exempt bond. Such a perpetual\n7% tax-exempt bond might be worth fifty cents on the dollar as\nthis is written.\n\nIf, on the other hand, all earnings of our typical American\nbusiness are retained and return on equity again remains\nconstant, earnings will grow at 14% per year. If the p/e ratio\nremains constant, the price of our typical stock will also grow\nat 14% per year. But that 14% is not yet in the pocket of the\nshareholder. Putting it there will require the payment of a\ncapital gains tax, presently assessed at a maximum rate of 20%.\nThis net return, of course, works out to a poorer rate of return\nthan the currently available passive after-tax rate.\n\nUnless passive rates fall, companies achieving 14% per year\ngains in earnings per share while paying no cash dividend are an\neconomic failure for their individual shareholders. The returns\nfrom passive capital outstrip the returns from active capital.\nThis is an unpleasant fact for both investors and corporate\nmanagers and, therefore, one they may wish to ignore. But facts\ndo not cease to exist, either because they are unpleasant or\nbecause they are ignored.\n\n",

    "content": "Equity Value-Added\n\nMost American businesses pay out a significant portion of\ntheir earnings and thus fall between the two examples. And most\nAmerican businesses are currently bad businesses economically -\nproducing less for their individual investors after-tax than the\ntax-exempt passive rate of return on money. Of course, some\nhigh-return businesses still remain attractive, even under\npresent conditions. But American equity capital, in aggregate,\nproduces no value-added for individual investors.\n\nIt should be stressed that this depressing situation does\nnot occur because corporations are jumping, economically, less\nhigh than previously. In fact, they are jumping somewhat higher:\nreturn on equity has improved a few points in the past decade.\nBut the crossbar of passive return has been elevated much faster.\nUnhappily, most companies can do little but hope that the bar\nwill be lowered significantly; there are few industries in which\nthe prospects seem bright for substantial gains in return on\nequity.\n\nInflationary experience and expectations will be major (but\nnot the only) factors affecting the height of the crossbar in\nfuture years. If the causes of long-term inflation can be\ntempered, passive returns are likely to fall and the intrinsic\nposition of American equity capital should significantly improve.\nMany businesses that now must be classified as economically bad\nwould be restored to the good category under such\ncircumstances.\n\nA further, particularly ironic, punishment is inflicted by\nan inflationary environment upon the owners of the bad\nbusiness. To continue operating in its present mode, such a lowreturn business usually must retain much of its earnings - no\nmatter what penalty such a policy produces for shareholders.\n\nReason, of course, would prescribe just the opposite policy.\nAn individual, stuck with a 5% bond with many years to run before\nmaturity, does not take the coupons from that bond and pay one\nhundred cents on the dollar for more 5% bonds while similar bonds\nare available at, say, forty cents on the dollar. Instead, he\ntakes those coupons from his low-return bond and - if inclined to\nreinvest - looks for the highest return with safety currently\navailable. Good money is not thrown after bad.\n\nWhat makes sense for the bondholder makes sense for the\nshareholder. Logically, a company with historic\nand prospective\n\nhigh returns on equity should retain much or all of its earnings\nso that shareholders can earn premium returns on enhanced\ncapital. Conversely, low returns on corporate equity would\nsuggest a very high dividend payout so that owners could direct\ncapital toward more attractive areas. (The Scriptures concur. In\nthe parable of the talents, the two high-earning servants are\nrewarded with 100% retention of earnings and encouraged to expand\ntheir operations. However, the non-earning third servant is not\nonly chastised - wicked and slothful - but also is required to\nredirect all of his capital to the top performer.\nMatthew 25:\n14-30)\n\nBut inflation takes us through the looking glass into the\nupside-down world of\nAlice in Wonderland.\nWhen prices\ncontinuously rise, the bad business must retain every nickel\nthat it can. Not because it is attractive as a repository for\nequity capital, but precisely because it is so unattractive, the\nlow-return business must follow a high retention policy. If it\nwishes to continue operating in the future as it has in the past\n- and most entities, including businesses, do - it simply has no\nchoice.\n\nFor inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm. That\ntapeworm preemptively consumes its requisite daily diet of\ninvestment dollars regardless of the health of the host organism.\nWhatever the level of reported profits (even if nil), more\ndollars for receivables, inventory and fixed assets are\ncontinuously required by the business in order to merely match\nthe unit volume of the previous year. The less prosperous the\nenterprise, the greater the proportion of available sustenance\nclaimed by the tapeworm.\n\nUnder present conditions, a business earning 8% or 10% on\nequity often has no leftovers for expansion, debt reduction or\nreal dividends. The tapeworm of inflation simply cleans the\nplate. (The low-return companys inability to pay dividends,\nunderstandably, is often disguised. Corporate America\nincreasingly is turning to dividend reinvestment plans, sometimes\neven embodying a discount arrangement that all but forces\nshareholders to reinvest. Other companies sell newly issued\nshares to Peter in order to pay dividends to Paul. Beware of\ndividends that can be paid out only if someone promises to\nreplace the capital distributed.)\n\nBerkshire continues to retain its earnings for offensive,\nnot defensive or obligatory, reasons. But in no way are we\nimmune from the pressures that escalating passive returns exert\non equity capital. We continue to clear the crossbar of aftertax passive return - but barely. Our historic 21% return - not\nat all assured for the future - still provides, after the current\ncapital gain tax rate (which we expect to rise considerably in\nfuture years), a modest margin over current after-tax rates on\npassive money. It would be a bit humiliating to have our\ncorporate value-added turn negative. But it can happen here as\nit has elsewhere, either from events outside anyones control or\nfrom poor relative adaptation on our part.\n\n",

(Berkshire shareholders may have reached\na similar conclusion after rereading our past annual reports\nfeaturing your Chairmans prescient analysis of textile\nprospects.)\n\nThere is no danger, however, in forecasting that 1982 will\nbe the worst year in recent history for insurance underwriting.\nThat result already has been guaranteed by present pricing\nbehavior, coupled with the term nature of the insurance contract.\n\nWhile many auto policies are priced and sold at six-month\nintervals - and many property policies are sold for a three-year\nterm - a weighted average of the duration of all propertycasualty insurance policies probably runs a little under twelve\nmonths. And prices for the insurance coverage, of course, are\nfrozen for the life of the contract. Thus, this years sales\ncontracts (premium written in the parlance of the industry)\ndetermine about one-half of next years level of revenue\n(premiums earned). The remaining half will be determined by\nsales contracts written next year that will be about 50% earned\nin that year. The profitability consequences are automatic: if\nyou make a mistake in pricing, you have to live with it for an\nuncomfortable period of time.\n\nNote in the table below the year-over-year gain in industrywide premiums written and the impact that it has on the current\nand following years level of underwriting profitability. The\nresult is exactly as you would expect in an inflationary world.\nWhen the volume gain is well up in double digits, it bodes well\nfor profitability trends in the current and following year. When\nthe industry volume gain is small, underwriting experience very\nshortly will get worse, no matter how unsatisfactory the current\nlevel.\n\nThe Bests data in the table reflect the experience of\npractically the entire industry, including stock, mutual and\nreciprocal companies. The combined ratio indicates total\noperating and loss costs as compared to premiums; a ratio below\n100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above 100 indicates\na loss.\n\n",

    "content": "Insurance Industry Conditions\n\n\n\nAs Pogo would say, The future isnt what it used to be.\nCurrent pricing practices promise devastating results,\nparticularly if the respite from major natural disasters that the\nindustry has enjoyed in recent years should end.\nFor\nunderwriting experience has been getting worse in spite of good\nluck, not because of bad luck.\nIn recent years hurricanes have\nstayed at sea and motorists have reduced their driving. They\nwont always be so obliging.\n\nAnd, of course the twin inflations, monetary and social\n(the tendency of courts and juries to stretch the coverage of\npolicies beyond what insurers, relying upon contract terminology\nand precedent, had expected), are unstoppable. Costs of\nrepairing both property and people - and the extent to which\nthese repairs are deemed to be the responsibility of the insurer\n- will advance relentlessly.\n\nAbsent any bad luck (catastrophes, increased driving, etc.),\nan immediate industry volume gain of at least 10% per year\nprobably is necessary to\nstabilize\nthe record level of\nunderwriting losses that will automatically prevail in mid-1982.\n(Most underwriters expect incurred losses in aggregate to rise at\nleast 10% annually; each, of course, counts on getting less than\nhis share.) Every percentage point of annual premium growth below\nthe 10% equilibrium figure quickens the pace of deterioration.\nQuarterly data in 1981 underscore the conclusion that a terrible\nunderwriting picture is worsening at an accelerating rate.\n\nIn the 1980 annual report we discussed the investment\npolicies that have destroyed the integrity of many insurers\nbalance sheets, forcing them to abandon underwriting discipline\nand write business at any price in order to avoid negative cash\nflow. It was clear that insurers with large holdings of bonds\nvalued, for accounting purposes, at nonsensically high prices\nwould have little choice but to keep the money revolving by\nselling large numbers of policies at nonsensically low prices.\nSuch insurers necessarily fear a major decrease in volume more\nthan they fear a major underwriting loss.\n\nBut, unfortunately, all insurers are affected; its\ndifficult to price much differently than your most threatened\ncompetitor. This pressure continues unabated and adds a new\nmotivation to the others that drive many insurance managers to\npush for business; worship of size over profitability, and the\nfear that market share surrendered never can be regained.\n\nWhatever the reasons, we believe it is true that virtually\nno major property-casualty insurer - despite protests by the\nentire industry that rates are inadequate and great selectivity\nshould be exercised - has been willing to turn down business to\nthe point where cash flow has turned significantly negative.\nAbsent such a willingness, prices will remain under severe\npressure.\n\nCommentators continue to talk of the underwriting cycle,\nusually implying a regularity of rhythm and a relatively constant\nmidpoint of profitability Our own view is different. We believe\nthat very large, although obviously varying, underwriting losses\nwill be the norm for the industry, and that the best underwriting\nyears in the future decade may appear substandard against the\naverage year of the past decade.\n\nWe have no magic formula to insulate our controlled\ninsurance companies against this deteriorating future. Our\nmanagers, particularly Phil Liesche, Bill Lyons, Roland Miller,\nFloyd Taylor and Milt Thornton, have done a magnificent job of\nswimming against the tide. We have sacrificed much volume, but\nhave maintained a substantial underwriting superiority in\nrelation to industry-wide results. The outlook at Berkshire is\nfor continued low volume. Our financial position offers us\nmaximum flexibility, a very rare condition in the propertycasualty insurance industry. And, at some point, should fear\never prevail throughout the industry, our financial strength\ncould become an operational asset of immense value.\n\nWe believe that GEICO Corporation, our major non-controlled\nbusiness operating in this field, is, by virtue of its extreme\nand improving operating efficiency, in a considerably more\nprotected position than almost any other major insurer. GEICO is\na brilliantly run implementation of a very important business\nidea.\n\n",

    "content": "Shareholder Designated Contributions\n\nOur new program enabling shareholders to designate the\nrecipients of corporate charitable contributions was greeted with\nextraordinary enthusiasm. A copy of the letter sent October 14,1981 describing this program appears on pages 51-53. Of 932,206\nshares eligible for participation (shares where the name of the\nactual owner appeared on our stockholder record), 95.6%\nresponded. Even excluding Buffet-related shares, the response\ntopped 90%.\n\nIn addition, more than 3% of our shareholders voluntarily\nwrote letters or notes, all but one approving of the program.\nBoth the level of participation and of commentary surpass any\nshareholder response we have witnessed, even when such response\nhas been intensively solicited by corporate staff and highly paid\nprofessional proxy organizations. In contrast, your\nextraordinary level of response occurred without even the nudge\nof a company-provided return envelope. This self-propelled\nbehavior speaks well for the program, and speaks well for our\nshareholders.\n\nApparently the owners of our corporation like both\npossessing and exercising the ability to determine where gifts of\ntheir funds shall be made. The father-knows-best school of\ncorporate governance will be surprised to find that none of our\nshareholders sent in a designation sheet with instructions that\nthe officers of Berkshire - in their superior wisdom, of course -\nmake the decision on charitable funds applicable to his shares.\nNor did anyone suggest that his share of our charitable funds be\nused to match contributions made by our corporate directors to\ncharities of the directors choice (a popular, proliferating and\nnon-publicized policy at many large corporations).\n\nAll told, $1,783,655 of shareholder-designed contributions\nwere distributed to about 675 charities. In addition, Berkshire\nand subsidiaries continue to make certain contributions pursuant\nto local level decisions made by our operating managers.\n\nThere will be some years, perhaps two or three out of ten,\nwhen contributions by Berkshire will produce substandard tax\ndeductions - or none at all. In those years we will not effect\nour shareholder designated charitable program. In all other\nyears we expect to inform you about October 10 th of the amount\nper share that you may designate. A reply form will accompany\nthe notice, and you will be given about three weeks to respond\nwith your designation.\nTo qualify, your shares must be\nregistered in your own name or the name of an owning trust,\ncorporation, partnership or estate, if applicable, on our\nstockholder list of September 30 th, or the Friday preceding if\nsuch date falls on a Saturday or Sunday.\n\nOur only disappointment with this program in 1981 was that\nsome of our shareholders, through no fault of their own, missed\nthe opportunity to participate. The Treasury Department ruling\nallowing us to proceed without tax uncertainty was received early\nin October. The ruling did not cover participation by\nshareholders whose stock was registered in the name of nominees,\nsuch as brokers, and additionally required that the owners of all\ndesignating shares make certain assurances to Berkshire. These\nassurances could not be given us in effective form by nominee\nholders.\n\n",

It was particularly important\nthat this information be communicated promptly to stockholders\nwhose holdings were in nominee name, since they would not be\neligible unless they took action to re-register their shares\nbefore the record date.\n\nUnfortunately, communication to such non-record shareholders\ncould take place only through the nominees. We therefore\nstrongly urged those nominees, mostly brokerage houses, to\npromptly transmit our letter to the real owners. We explained\nthat their failure to do so could deprive such owners of an\nimportant benefit.\n\nThe results from our urgings would not strengthen the case\nfor private ownership of the U. S. Postal Service. Many of our\nshareholders never heard from their brokers (as some shareholders\ntold us after reading news accounts of the program). Others were\nforwarded our letter too late for action.\n\nOne of the largest brokerage houses claiming to hold stock\nfor sixty of its clients (about 4% of our shareholder\npopulation), apparently transmitted our letter about three weeks\nafter receipt - too late for any of the sixty to participate.\n(Such lassitude did not pervade all departments of that firm; it\nbilled Berkshire for mailing services within six days of that\nbelated and ineffectual action.)\n\nWe recite such horror stories for two reasons: (1) if you\nwish to participate in future designated contribution programs,\nbe sure to have your stock registered in your name well before\nSeptember 30 th; and (2) even if you dont care to participate and\nprefer to leave your stock in nominee form, it would be wise to\nhave at least one share registered in your own name. By so\ndoing, you can be sure that you will be notified of any important\ncorporate news at the same time as all other shareholders.\n\nThe designated-contributions idea, along with many other\nideas that have turned out well for us, was conceived by Charlie\nMunger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire and Chairman of Blue Chip.\nIrrespective of titles, Charlie and I work as partners in\nmanaging all controlled companies. To almost a sinful degree, we\nenjoy our work as managing partners. And we enjoy having you as\nour financial partners.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
