    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nThis letter comes to you as part of Berkshire’s annual report. As a public company, we\nare required to periodically tell you many specific facts and figures.\n“Report,” however, implies a greater responsibility. In addition to the mandated data, we\nbelieve we owe you additional commentary about what you own and how we think. Our goal is\nto communicate with you in a manner that we would wish you to use if our positions were\nreversed – that is, if you were Berkshire’s CEO while I and my family were passive investors,\ntrusting you with our savings.\nThis approach leads us to an annual recitation of both good and bad developments at the\nmany businesses you indirectly own through your Berkshire shares. When discussing problems\nat specific subsidiaries, we do, however, try to follow the advice Tom Murphy gave to me 60\nyears ago: “praise by name, criticize by category.”\nMistakes – Yes, We Make Them at Berkshire\nSometimes I’ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of a business I’ve\npurchased for Berkshire – each a case of capital allocation gone wrong. That happens with both\njudgments about marketable equities – we view these as partial ownership of businesses – and\nthe 100% acquisitions of companies.\nAt other times, I’ve made mistakes when assessing the abilities or fidelity of the\nmanagers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity disappointments can hurt beyond their financial\nimpact, a pain that can approach that of a failed marriage.\nA decent batting average in personnel decisions is all that can be hoped for. The cardinal\nsin is delaying the correction of mistakes or what Charlie Munger called “thumb-sucking.”\nProblems, he would tell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however\nuncomfortable that may be.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nDuring the 2019-23 period, I have used the words “mistake” or “error” 16 times in my\nletters to you. Many other huge companies have never used either word over that span. Amazon,\nI should acknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021 letter. Elsewhere, it\nhas generally been happy talk and pictures.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nI have also been a director of large public companies at which “mistake” or “wrong” were\nforbidden words at board meetings or analyst calls. That taboo, implying managerial perfection,\nalways made me nervous (though, at times, there could be legal issues that make limited\ndiscussion advisable. We live in a very litigious society.)\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the\nannual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a “report” is what a Berkshire CEO annually\nowes to owners. And he also understands that if you start fooling your shareholders, you will\nsoon believe your own baloney and be fooling yourself as well.\n",

    "content": "Pete Liegl – One of a Kind\nLet me pause to tell you the remarkable story of Pete Liegl, a man unknown to most\nBerkshire shareholders but one who contributed many billions to their aggregate wealth. Pete\ndied in November, still working at 80.\nI first heard of Forest River – the Indiana company Pete founded and managed – on\nJune 21,2005. On that day I received a letter from an intermediary detailing relevant data about\nthe company, a recreational vehicle (“RV”) manufacturer. The writer said that Pete, the 100%\nowner of Forest River, specifically wanted to sell to Berkshire. He also told me the price that Pete\nexpected to receive. I liked this no-nonsense approach.\nI did some checking with RV dealers, liked what I learned and arranged a June 28 th\nmeeting in Omaha. Pete brought along his wife, Sharon, and daughter, Lisa. When we met, Pete\nassured me that he wanted to keep running the business but would feel more comfortable if he\ncould assure financial security for his family.\nPete next mentioned that he owned some real estate that was leased to Forest River and\nhad not been covered in the June 21 letter. Within a few minutes, we arrived at a price for those\nassets as I expressed no need for appraisal by Berkshire but would simply accept his valuation.\nThen we arrived at the other point that needed clarity. I asked Pete what his compensation\nshould be, adding that whatever he said, I would accept. (This, I should add, is not an approach I\nrecommend for general use.)\nPete paused as his wife, daughter and I leaned forward. Then he surprised us: “Well, I\nlooked at Berkshire’s proxy statement and I wouldn’t want to make more than my boss, so pay\nme $100,000 per year.” After I picked myself off the floor, Pete added: “But we will earn X (he\nnamed a number) this year, and I would like an annual bonus of 10% of any earnings above what\nthe company is now delivering.” I replied: “OK Pete, but if Forest River makes any significant\nacquisitions we will make an appropriate adjustment for the additional capital thus employed.” I\ndidn’t define “appropriate” or “significant,” but those vague terms never caused a problem.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nThe four of us then went to dinner at Omaha’s Happy Hollow Club and lived happily\never after. During the next 19 years, Pete shot the lights out. No competitor came close to his\nperformance.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nEvery company doesn’t have an easy-to-understand business and there are very few\nowners or managers like Pete. And, of course, I expect to make my share of mistakes about the\nbusinesses Berkshire buys and sometimes err in evaluating the sort of person with whom I’m\ndealing.\nBut I’ve also had many pleasant surprises in both the potential of the business as well as\nthe ability and fidelity of the manager. And our experience is that a single winning decision can\nmake a breathtaking difference over time. (Think GEICO as a business decision, Ajit Jain as a\nmanagerial decision and my luck in finding Charlie Munger as a one-of-a-kind partner, personal\nadvisor and steadfast friend.) Mistakes fade away; winners can forever blossom.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOne further point in our CEO selections: I never look at where a candidate has gone to\nschool. Never!\nOf course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are\nplenty such as Pete who may have benefitted by attending a less prestigious institution or even\nby not bothering to finish school. Look at my friend, Bill Gates, who decided that it was far more\nimportant to get underway in an exploding industry that would change the world than it was to\nstick around for a parchment that he could hang on the wall. (Read his new book, Source Code.)\nNot long ago, I met – by phone – Jessica Toonkel, whose step-grandfather, Ben Rosner,\nlong ago ran a business for Charlie and me. Ben was a retailing genius and, in preparing for this\nreport, I checked with Jessica to confirm Ben’s schooling, which I remembered as limited.\nJessica’s reply: “Ben never went past 6 th grade.”\nI was lucky enough to get an education at three fine universities. And I avidly believe in\nlifelong learning. I’ve observed, however, that a very large portion of business talent is innate\nwith nature swamping nurture.\nPete Liegl was a natural.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\n",

We were aided by a predictable large gain in\ninvestment income as Treasury Bill yields improved and we substantially increased our holdings\nof these highly-liquid short-term securities.\nOur insurance business also delivered a major increase in earnings, led by the\nperformance of GEICO. In five years, Todd Combs has reshaped GEICO in a major way,\nincreasing efficiency and bringing underwriting practices up to date. GEICO was a long-held\ngem that needed major repolishing, and Todd has worked tirelessly in getting the job done.\nThough not yet complete, the 2024 improvement was spectacular.\nIn general, property-casualty (“P/C”) insurance pricing strengthened during 2024,\nreflecting a major increase in damage from convective storms. Climate change may have been\nannouncing its arrival. However, no “monster” event occurred during 2024. Someday, any day, a\ntruly staggering insurance loss will occur – and there is no guarantee that there will be only one\nper annum.\nThe P/C business is so central to Berkshire that it warrants a further discussion that\nappears later in this letter.\nBerkshire’s railroad and utility operations, our two largest businesses outside of\ninsurance, improved their aggregate earnings. Both, however, have much left to accomplish.\nLate in the year we increased our ownership of the utility operation from about 92% to\n100% at a cost of roughly $3.9 billion, of which $2.9 billion was paid in cash with a balance in\nBerkshire “B” shares.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAll told, we recorded operating earnings of $47.4 billion in 2024. We regularly – endlessly,\nsome readers may groan – emphasize this measure rather than the GAAP-mandated earnings that\nare reported on page K-68.\nOur measure excludes capital gains or losses on the stocks and bonds we own, whether\nrealized or unrealized. Over time, we think it highly likely that gains will prevail – why else\nwould we buy these securities? – though the year-by-year numbers will swing wildly and\nunpredictably. Our horizon for such commitments is almost always far longer than a single year.\nIn many, our thinking involves decades. These long-termers are the purchases that sometimes\nmake the cash register ring like church bells.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\n",

    "content": "Surprise, Surprise! An Important American Record is Smashed\nSixty years ago, present management took control of Berkshire. That move was a\nmistake – my mistake – and one that plagued us for two decades. Charlie, I should emphasize,\nspotted my obvious error immediately: Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its\nbusiness – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.\nThe U. S. Treasury, of all places, had already received silent warnings of Berkshire’s\ndestiny. In 1965, the company did not pay a dime of income tax, an embarrassment that had\ngenerally prevailed at the company for a decade. That sort of economic behavior may be\nunderstandable for glamorous startups, but it’s a blinking yellow light when it happens at a\nvenerable pillar of American industry. Berkshire was headed for the ash can.\nFast forward 60 years and imagine the surprise at the Treasury when that same\ncompany – still operating under the name of Berkshire Hathaway – paid far more in corporate\nincome tax than the U. S. government had ever received from any company – even the American\ntech titans that commanded market values in the trillions.\nTo be precise, Berkshire last year made four payments to the IRS that totaled $26.8\nbillion. That’s about 5% of what all of corporate America paid. (In addition, we paid sizable\namounts for income taxes to foreign governments and to 44 states.)\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nNote one crucial factor allowing this record-shattering payment: Berkshire shareholders\nduring the same 1965-2024 period received only one cash dividend. On January 3,1967, we\ndisbursed our sole payment – $101,755 or 10¢ per A share. (I can’t remember why I suggested\nthis action to Berkshire’s board of directors. Now it seems like a bad dream.)\nFor sixty years, Berkshire shareholders endorsed continuous reinvestment and that\nenabled the company to build its taxable income. Cash income-tax payments to the U. S.\nTreasury, miniscule in the first decade, now aggregate more than $101 billion . . . and counting.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nHuge numbers can be hard to visualize. Let me recast the $26.8 billion that we paid last\nyear.\nIf Berkshire had sent the Treasury a $1 million check every 20 minutes throughout all of\n2024 – visualize 366 days and nights because 2024 was a leap year – we still would have owed\nthe federal government a significant sum at yearend. Indeed, it would be well into January before\nthe Treasury would tell us that we could take a short breather, get some sleep, and prepare for our\n2025 tax payments.\n",

    "content": "Where Your Money Is\nBerkshire’s equity activity is ambidextrous. In one hand we own control of many\nbusinesses, holding at least 80% of the investee’s shares. Generally, we own 100%.\nThese 189 subsidiaries have similarities to marketable common stocks but are far from\nidentical. The collection is worth many hundreds of billions and includes a few rare gems,\nmany good-but-far-from-fabulous businesses and some laggards that have been disappointments.\nWe own nothing that is a major drag, but we have a number that I should not have purchased.\nIn the other hand, we own a small percentage of a dozen or so very large and highly\nprofitable businesses with household names such as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and\nMoody’s. Many of these companies earn very high returns on the net tangible equity required for\ntheir operations. At yearend, our partial-ownership holdings were valued at $272 billion.\nUnderstandably, really outstanding businesses are very seldom offered in their entirety, but small\nfractions of these gems can be purchased Monday through Friday on Wall Street and, very\noccasionally, they sell at bargain prices.\nWe are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon\nwhere we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very\ninfrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities. Greg has vividly shown his ability to\nact at such times as did Charlie.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nWith marketable equities, it is easier to change course when I make a mistake.\nBerkshire’s present size, it should be underscored, diminishes this valuable option. We can’t\ncome and go on a dime. Sometimes a year or more is required to establish or divest an\ninvestment. Additionally, with ownership of minority positions we can’t change management if\nthat action is needed or control what is done with capital flows if we are unhappy with the\ndecisions being made.\nWith controlled companies, we can dictate these decisions, but we have far less flexibility\nin the disposition of mistakes. In reality, Berkshire almost never sells controlled businesses\nunless we face what we believe to be unending problems. An offset is that some business owners\nseek out Berkshire because of our steadfast behavior. Occasionally, that can be a decided plus for\nus.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nDespite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at\nBerkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change.\nWhile our ownership in marketable equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to\n$272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far\ngreater than the value of the marketable portfolio.\nBerkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority\nof their money in equities – mostly American equities although many of these will have\ninternational operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent\nassets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned.\nPaper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this\nreckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U. S. has come\nclose to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.\nBusinesses, as well as individuals with desired talents, however, will usually find a way\nto cope with monetary instability as long as their goods or services are desired by the country’s\ncitizenry. So, too, with personal skills. Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful\nvoice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities\nthroughout my life. In effect, I have depended on the success of American businesses and I will\ncontinue to do so.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOne way or another, the sensible – better yet imaginative – deployment of savings by\ncitizens is required to propel an ever-growing societal output of desired goods and services. This\nsystem is called capitalism. It has its faults and abuses – in certain respects more egregious now\nthan ever – but it also can work wonders unmatched by other economic systems.\nAmerica is Exhibit A. Our country’s progress over its mere 235 years of existence could\nnot have been imagined by even the most optimistic colonists in 1789, when the Constitution\nwas adopted and the country’s energies were unleashed.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nTrue, our country in its infancy sometimes borrowed abroad to supplement our own\nsavings. But, concurrently, we needed many Americans to consistently save and then needed\nthose savers or other Americans to wisely deploy the capital thus made available. If America had\nconsumed all that it produced, the country would have been spinning its wheels.\nThe American process has not always been pretty – our country has forever had many\nscoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with\ntheir savings. But even with such malfeasance – which remains in full force today – and also\nmuch deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or\ndisruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output\nbeyond the dreams of any colonist.\nFrom a base of only four million people – and despite a brutal internal war early on,\npitting one American against another – America changed the world in the blink of a celestial eye.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn a very minor way, Berkshire shareholders have participated in the American miracle by\nforegoing dividends, thereby electing to reinvest rather than consume. Originally, this\nreinvestment was tiny, almost meaningless, but over time, it mushroomed, reflecting the mixture\nof a sustained culture of savings, combined with the magic of long-term compounding.\nBerkshire’s activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished.\nCompanies die for many reasons but, unlike the fate of humans, old age itself is not lethal.\nBerkshire today is far more youthful than it was in 1965.\nHowever, as Charlie and I have always acknowledged, Berkshire would not have\nachieved its results in any locale except America whereas America would have been every bit the\nsuccess it has been if Berkshire had never existed.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSo thank you, Uncle Sam. Someday your nieces and nephews at Berkshire hope to send\nyou even larger payments than we did in 2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for\nno fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we\nneed you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on\nyour part.\n",

    "content": "Property-Casualty Insurance\nP/C insurance continues to be Berkshire’s core business. The industry follows a financial\nmodel that is rare – very rare – among giant businesses.\nCustomarily, companies incur costs for labor, materials, inventories, plant and equipment,\netc. before – or concurrently with – the sale of their products or services. Consequently, their\nCEOs have a good fix on knowing the cost of their product before they sell it. If the selling price\nis less than its cost, managers soon learn they have a problem. Hemorrhaging cash is hard to\nignore.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nWhen writing P/C insurance, we receive payment upfront and much later learn what our\nproduct has cost us – sometimes a moment of truth that is delayed as much as 30 or more years.\n(We are still making substantial payments on asbestos exposures that occurred 50 or more years\nago.)\nThis mode of operations has the desirable effect of giving P/C insurers cash before\nthey incur most expenses but carries with it the risk that the company can be losing\nmoney – sometimes mountains of money – before the CEO and directors realize what is\nhappening.\nCertain lines of insurance minimize this mismatch, such as crop insurance or hail damage\nin which losses are quickly reported, evaluated and paid. Other lines, however, can lead to\nexecutive and shareholder bliss as the company is going broke. Think coverages such as medical\nmalpractice or product liability. In “long-tail” lines, a P/C insurer may report large but fictitious\nprofits to its owners and regulators for many years – even decades. The accounting can be\nparticularly dangerous if the CEO is an optimist or a crook. These possibilities are not fanciful:\nHistory reveals a large number of each species.\nIn recent decades, this “money-up-front, loss-payments-later” model has allowed\nBerkshire to invest large sums (“float”) while generally delivering what we believe to be a small\nunderwriting profit. We make estimates for “surprises” and, so far, these estimates have been\nsufficient.\nWe are not deterred by the dramatic and growing loss payments sustained by our\nactivities. (As I write this, think wildfires.) It’s our job to price to absorb these and unemotionally\ntake our lumps when surprises develop. It’s also our job to contest “runaway” verdicts, spurious\nlitigation and outright fraudulent behavior.\nUnder Ajit, our insurance operation has blossomed from an obscure Omaha-based\ncompany into a world leader, renowned for both its taste for risk and its Gibraltar-like financial\nstrength. Moreover, Greg, our directors and I all have a very large investment in Berkshire in\nrelation to any compensation we receive. We do not use options or other one-sided forms of\ncompensation; if you lose money, so do we. This approach encourages caution but does not\nensure foresight.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nP/C insurance growth is dependent on increased economic risk. No risk – no need for\ninsurance.\nThink back only 135 years when the world had no autos, trucks or airplanes. Now there\nare 300 million vehicles in the U. S. alone, a massive fleet causing huge damage daily. Property\ndamage arising from hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires is massive, growing and increasingly\nunpredictable in their patterns and eventual costs.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nIt would be foolish – make that madness – to write ten-year policies for these coverages,\nbut we believe one-year assumption of such risks is generally manageable. If we change our\nminds, we will change the contracts we offer. During my lifetime, auto insurers have generally\nabandoned one-year policies and switched to the six-month variety. This change reduced float\nbut allowed more intelligent underwriting.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nNo private insurer has the willingness to take on the amount of risk that Berkshire can\nprovide. At times, this advantage can be important. But we also need to shrink when prices are\ninadequate. We must never write inadequately-priced policies in order to stay in the game. That\npolicy is corporate suicide.\nProperly pricing P/C insurance is part art, part science and is definitely not a business for\noptimists. Mike Goldberg, the Berkshire executive who recruited Ajit, said it best: “We want our\nunderwriters to daily come to work nervous, but not paralyzed.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAll things considered, we like the P/C insurance business. Berkshire can financially and\npsychologically handle extreme losses without blinking. We are also not dependent on reinsurers\nand that gives us a material and enduring cost advantage. Finally, we have outstanding managers\n(no optimists) and are particularly well-situated to utilize the substantial sums P/C insurance\ndelivers for investment.\nOver the past two decades, our insurance business has generated $32 billion of after-tax\nprofits from underwriting, about 3.3 cents per dollar of sales after income tax. Meanwhile, our\nfloat has grown from $46 billion to $171 billion. The float is likely to grow a bit over time and,\nwith intelligent underwriting (and some luck), has a reasonable prospect of being costless.\n",

    "content": "Berkshire Increases its Japanese Investments\nA small but important exception to our U. S.-based focus is our growing investment in\nJapan.\nIt’s been almost six years since Berkshire began purchasing shares in five Japanese\ncompanies that very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. The\nfive are (alphabetically) ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. Each of these\nlarge enterprises, in turn, owns interests in a vast array of businesses, many based in Japan but\nothers that operate throughout the world.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nBerkshire made its first purchases involving the five in July 2019. We simply looked at\ntheir financial records and were amazed at the low prices of their stocks. As the years have\npassed, our admiration for these companies has consistently grown. Greg has met many times\nwith them, and I regularly follow their progress. Both of us like their capital deployment, their\nmanagements and their attitude in respect to their investors.\nEach of the five companies increase dividends when appropriate, they repurchase their\nshares when it is sensible to do so, and their top managers are far less aggressive in their\ncompensation programs than their U. S. counterparts.\nOur holdings of the five are for the very long term, and we are committed to supporting\ntheir boards of directors. From the start, we also agreed to keep Berkshire’s holdings below 10%\nof each company’s shares. But, as we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to\nmoderately relax the ceiling. Over time, you will likely see Berkshire’s ownership of all five\nincrease somewhat.\nAt yearend, Berkshire’s aggregate cost (in dollars) was $13.8 billion and the market value\nof our holdings totaled $23.5 billion.\nMeanwhile, Berkshire has consistently – but not pursuant to any formula – increased its\nyen-denominated borrowings. All are at fixed rates, no “floaters.” Greg and I have no view on\nfuture foreign exchange rates and therefore seek a position approximating currency-neutrality.\nWe are required, however, under GAAP rules to regularly recognize in our earnings a calculation\nof any gains or losses in the yen we have borrowed and, at yearend, had included $2.3 billion of\nafter-tax gains due to dollar strength of which $850 million occurred in 2024.\nI expect that Greg and his eventual successors will be holding this Japanese position for\nmany decades and that Berkshire will find other ways to work productively with the five\ncompanies in the future.\nWe like the current math of our yen-balanced strategy as well. As I write this, the annual\ndividend income expected from the Japanese investments in 2025 will total about $812 million\nand the interest cost of our yen-denominated debt will be about $135 million.\n",

    "content": "The Annual Gathering in Omaha\nI hope you will join us in Omaha on May 3 rd. We are following a somewhat changed\nschedule this year, but the basics remain the same. Our goal is that you get many of your\nquestions answered, that you connect with friends, and that you leave with a good impression of\nOmaha. The city looks forward to your visits.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nWe will have much the same group of volunteers to offer you a wide variety of Berkshire\nproducts that will lighten your wallet and brighten your day. As usual, we will be open on Friday\nfrom noon until 5 p. m. with lovable Squishmallows, underwear from Fruit of the Loom, Brooks\nrunning shoes and a host of other items to tempt you.\nAgain, we will have only one book for sale. Last year we featured Poor Charlie’s\nAlmanack and sold out – 5,000 copies disappeared before the close of business on Saturday.\nThis year we will offer 60 Years of Berkshire Hathaway. In 2015, I asked Carrie Sova,\nwho among her many duties managed much of the activity at the annual meeting, to try her hand\nat putting together a light-hearted history of Berkshire. I gave her full reign to use her\nimagination, and she quickly produced a book that blew me away with its ingenuity, contents and\ndesign.\nSubsequently, Carrie left Berkshire to raise a family and now has three children. But each\nsummer, the Berkshire office force gets together to watch the Omaha Storm Chasers play\nbaseball against a Triple A opponent. I ask a few alums to join us, and Carrie usually comes with\nher family. At this year’s event, I brazenly asked her if she would do a 60 th Anniversary issue,\nfeaturing Charlie’s photos, quotes and stories that have seldom been made public.\nEven with three young children to manage, Carrie immediately said “yes.” Consequently,\nwe will have 5,000 copies of the new book available for sale on Friday afternoon and from\n7 a. m. to 4 p. m. on Saturday.\nCarrie refused any payment for her extensive work on the new “Charlie” edition. I\nsuggested she and I co-sign 20 copies to be given to any shareholder contributing $5,000 to the\nStephen Center that serves homeless adults and children in South Omaha. The Kizer family,\nbeginning with Bill Kizer, Sr., my long-time friend and Carrie’s grandfather, have for decades\nbeen assisting this worthy institution. Whatever is raised through the sale of the 20 autographed\nbooks, I will match.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBecky Quick will cover our somewhat re-engineered gathering on Saturday. Becky\nknows Berkshire like a book and always arranges interesting interviews with managers,\ninvestors, shareholders and an occasional celebrity. She and her CNBC crew do a great job of\nboth transmitting our meetings worldwide and archiving much Berkshire-related material. Give\nour director, Steve Burke, credit for the archive idea.\nWe will not have a movie this year but rather will convene a bit earlier at 8 a. m. I will\nmake a few introductory remarks, and we will promptly get to the Q&A, alternating questions\nbetween Becky and the audience.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nGreg and Ajit will join me in answering questions and we will take a half-hour break at\n10: 30 a. m. When we reconvene at 11: 00 a. m., only Greg will join me on stage. This year we will\ndisband at 1: 00 p. m. but stay open for shopping in the exhibit area until 4: 00 p. m.\nYou can find the full details regarding weekend activities on page 16. Note particularly\nthe always-popular Brooks run on Sunday morning. (I will be sleeping.)\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMy wise and good-looking sister, Bertie, of whom I wrote last year, will be attending the\nmeeting along with two of her daughters, both good-looking as well. Observers all agree that the\ngenes producing this dazzling result flow down only the female side of the family. (Sob.)\nBertie is now 91 and we talk regularly on Sundays using old-fashion telephones for\ncommunications. We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative\nmerits of our canes. In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.\nBut Bertie regularly one-ups me by asserting that she enjoys an additional benefit: When\na woman uses a cane, she tells me, men quit “hitting” on her. Bertie’s explanation is that the male\nego is such that little old ladies with canes simply aren’t an appropriate target. Presently, I have\nno data to counter her assertion.\nBut I have suspicions. At the meeting I can’t see much from the stage, and I would\nappreciate it if attendees would keep an eye on Bertie. Let me know if the cane is really doing its\njob. My bet is that she will be surrounded by males. For those of a certain age, the scene will\nbring back memories of Scarlett O’Hara and her horde of male admirers in Gone with the Wind.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe Berkshire directors and I immensely enjoy having you come to Omaha, and I predict\nthat you will have a good time and likely make some new friends.\nFebruary 22,2025 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\n",
