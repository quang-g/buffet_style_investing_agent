    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1987 was $464 million, or\n19.5%. Over the last 23 years (that is, since present management\ntook over), our per-share book value has grown from $19.46 to\n$2,477.47, or at a rate of 23.1% compounded annually.\n\nWhat counts, of course, is the rate of gain in per-share\nbusiness value, not book value. In many cases, a corporation's\nbook value and business value are almost totally unrelated. For\nexample, just before they went bankrupt, LTV and Baldwin-United\npublished yearend audits showing their book values to be $652\nmillion and $397 million, respectively. Conversely, Belridge Oil\nwas sold to Shell in 1979 for $3.6 billion although its book\nvalue was only $177 million.\n\nAt Berkshire, however, the two valuations have tracked\nrather closely, with the growth rate in business value over the\nlast decade moderately outpacing the growth rate in book value.\nThis good news continued in 1987.\n\nOur premium of business value to book value has widened for\ntwo simple reasons: We own some remarkable businesses and they\nare run by even more remarkable managers.\n\nYou have a right to question that second assertion. After\nall, CEOs seldom tell their shareholders that they have assembled\na bunch of turkeys to run things. Their reluctance to do so\nmakes for some strange annual reports. Oftentimes, in his\nshareholders' letter, a CEO will go on for pages detailing\ncorporate performance that is woefully inadequate. He will\nnonetheless end with a warm paragraph describing his managerial\ncomrades as \"our most precious asset.\" Such comments sometimes\nmake you wonder what the other assets can possibly be.\n\nAt Berkshire, however, my appraisal of our operating\nmanagers is, if anything, understated. To understand why, first\ntake a look at page 7, where we show the earnings (on an\nhistorical-cost accounting basis) of our seven largest nonfinancial units: Buffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska\nFurniture Mart, Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group, See's Candies,\nand World Book. In 1987, these seven business units had combined\noperating earnings before interest and taxes of $180 million.\n\nBy itself, this figure says nothing about economic\nperformance. To evaluate that, we must know how much total\ncapital - debt and equity - was needed to produce these earnings.\nDebt plays an insignificant role at our seven units: Their net\ninterest expense in 1987 was only $2 million. Thus, pre-tax\nearnings on the equity capital employed by these businesses\namounted to $178 million. And this equity - again on an\nhistorical-cost basis - was only $175 million.\n\nIf these seven business units had operated as a single\ncompany, their 1987\nafter\n-tax earnings would have been\napproximately $100 million - a return of about 57% on equity\ncapital. You'll seldom see such a percentage anywhere, let alone\nat large, diversified companies with nominal leverage. Here's a\nbenchmark: In its 1988 Investor's Guide issue,\nFortune\nreported\nthat among the 500 largest industrial companies and 500 largest\nservice companies, only six had averaged a return on equity of\nover 30% during the previous decade. The best performer among\nthe 1000 was Commerce Clearing House at 40.2%.\n\nOf course, the returns that Berkshire earns from these seven\nunits are not as high as their underlying returns because, in\naggregate, we bought the businesses at a substantial premium to\nunderlying equity capital. Overall, these operations are carried\non our books at about $222 million above the historical\naccounting values of the underlying assets. However, the\nmanagers of the units should be judged by the returns they\nachieve on the underlying assets; what we pay for a business does\nnot affect the amount of capital its manager has to work with.\n(If, to become a shareholder and part owner of Commerce Clearing\nHouse, you pay, say, six times book value, that does not change\nCCH's return on equity.)\n\nThree important inferences can be drawn from the figures I\nhave cited. First, the current business value of these seven\nunits is far above their historical book value and also far above\nthe value at which they are carried on Berkshire's balance sheet.\nSecond, because so little capital is required to run these\nbusinesses, they can grow while concurrently making almost all of\ntheir earnings available for deployment in new opportunities.\nThird, these businesses are run by truly extraordinary managers.\nThe Blumkins, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey, and Ralph\nSchey all meld unusual talent, energy and character to achieve\nexceptional financial results.\n\nFor good reasons, we had very high expectations when we\njoined with these managers. In every case, however, our\nexperience has greatly exceeded those expectations. We have\nreceived far more than we deserve, but we are willing to accept\nsuch inequities. (We subscribe to the view Jack Benny expressed\nupon receiving an acting award: \"I don't deserve this, but then,\nI have arthritis and I don't deserve that either.\")\n\nBeyond the Sainted Seven, we have our other major unit,\ninsurance, which I believe also has a business value well above\nthe net assets employed in it. However, appraising the business\nvalue of a property-casualty insurance company is a decidedly\nimprecise process. The industry is volatile, reported earnings\noftentimes are seriously inaccurate, and recent changes in the\nTax Code will severely hurt future profitability. Despite these\nproblems, we like the business and it will almost certainly\nremain our largest operation. Under Mike Goldberg's management,\nthe insurance business should treat us well over time.\n\nWith managers like ours, my partner, Charlie Munger, and I\nhave little to do with operations. in fact, it is probably fair\nto say that if we did more, less would be accomplished. We have\nno corporate meetings, no corporate budgets, and no performance\nreviews (though our managers, of course, oftentimes find such\nprocedures useful at their operating units). After all, what can\nwe tell the Blumkins about home furnishings, or the Heldmans\nabout uniforms?\n\nOur major contribution to the operations of our subsidiaries\nis applause. But it is not the indiscriminate applause of a\nPollyanna. Rather it is informed applause based upon the two\nlong careers we have spent intensively observing business\nperformance and managerial behavior. Charlie and I have seen so\nmuch of the ordinary in business that we can truly appreciate a\nvirtuoso performance. Only one response to the 1987 performance\nof our operating managers is appropriate: sustained, deafening\napplause.\n",

    "content": "Sources of Reported Earnings\n\n\n\nThere's not a lot new to report about these businesses - and\nthat's good, not bad. Severe change and exceptional returns\nusually don't mix. Most investors, of course, behave as if just\nthe opposite were true. That is, they usually confer the highest\nprice-earnings ratios on exotic-sounding businesses that hold out\nthe promise of feverish change. That prospect lets investors\nfantasize about future profitability rather than face today's\nbusiness realities. For such investor-dreamers, any blind date\nis preferable to one with the girl next door, no matter how\ndesirable she may be.\n\nExperience, however, indicates that the best business\nreturns are usually achieved by companies that are doing\nsomething quite similar today to what they were doing five or ten\nyears ago. That is no argument for managerial complacency.\nBusinesses always have opportunities to improve service, product\nlines, manufacturing techniques, and the like, and obviously\nthese opportunities should be seized. But a business that\nconstantly encounters major change also encounters many chances\nfor major error. Furthermore, economic terrain that is forever\nshifting violently is ground on which it is difficult to build a\nfortress-like business franchise. Such a franchise is usually\nthe key to sustained high returns.\n\nThe\nFortune\nstudy I mentioned earlier supports our view.\nOnly 25 of the 1,000 companies met two tests of economic\nexcellence - an average return on equity of over 20% in the ten\nyears, 1977 through 1986, and no year worse than 15%. These\nbusiness superstars were also stock market superstars: During the\ndecade, 24 of the 25 outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe\nFortune\nchamps may surprise you in two respects. First,\nmost use very little leverage compared to their interest-paying\ncapacity. Really good businesses usually don't need to borrow.\nSecond, except for one company that is \"high-tech\" and several\nothers that manufacture ethical drugs, the companies are in\nbusinesses that, on balance, seem rather mundane. Most sell nonsexy products or services in much the same manner as they did ten\nyears ago (though in larger quantities now, or at higher prices,\nor both). The record of these 25 companies confirms that making\nthe most of an already strong business franchise, or\nconcentrating on a single winning business theme, is what usually\nproduces exceptional economics.\n\nBerkshire's experience has been similar. Our managers have\nproduced extraordinary results by doing rather ordinary things -\nbut doing them exceptionally well. Our managers protect their\nfranchises, they control costs, they search for new products and\nmarkets that build on their existing strengths and they don't get\ndiverted. They work exceptionally hard at the details of their\nbusinesses, and it shows.\n\nHere's an update:\n\no\nAgatha Christie, whose husband was an archaeologist, said\nthat was the perfect profession for one's spouse: \"The older you\nbecome, the more interested they are in you.\" It is students of\nbusiness management, not archaeologists, who should be interested\nin Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin), the 94-year-old chairman of Nebraska\nFurniture Mart.\n\nFifty years ago Mrs. B started the business with $500, and\ntoday NFM is far and away the largest home furnishings store in\nthe country. Mrs. B continues to work seven days a week at the\njob from the opening of each business day until the close. She\nbuys, she sells, she manages - and she runs rings around the\ncompetition. It's clear to me that she's gathering speed and may\nwell reach her full potential in another five or ten years.\nTherefore, I've persuaded the Board to scrap our mandatory\nretirement-at-100 policy. (And it's about time: With every\npassing year, this policy has seemed sillier to me.)\n\nNet sales of NFM were $142.6 million in 1987, up 8% from\n1986. There's nothing like this store in the country, and\nthere's nothing like the family Mrs. B has produced to carry on:\nHer son Louie, and his three boys, Ron, Irv and Steve, possess\nthe business instincts, integrity and drive of Mrs. B. They work\nas a team and, strong as each is individually, the whole is far\ngreater than the sum of the parts.\n\nThe superb job done by the Blumkins benefits us as owners,\nbut even more dramatically benefits NFM's customers. They saved\nabout $30 million in 1987 by buying from NFM. In other words,\nthe goods they bought would have cost that much more if purchased\nelsewhere.\n\nYou'll enjoy an anonymous letter I received last August:\n\"Sorry to see Berkshire profits fall in the second quarter. One\nway you may gain back part of your lost. (sic) Check the pricing\nat The Furniture Mart. You will find that they are leaving 10%\nto 20% on the table. This additional profit on $140 million of\nsells (sic) is $28 million. Not small change in anyone's pocket!\nCheck out other furniture, carpet, appliance and T. V. dealers.\nYour raising prices to a reasonable profit will help. Thank you.\n/signed/ A Competitor.\"\n\nNFM will continue to grow and prosper by following Mrs. B's\nmaxim: \"Sell cheap and tell the truth.\"\n\no\nAmong dominant papers of its size or larger, the Buffalo\nNews continues to be the national leader in two important ways:\n(1) its weekday and Sunday penetration rate (the percentage of\nhouseholds in the paper's primary market area that purchase it);\nand (2) its \"news-hole\" percentage (the portion of the paper\ndevoted to news).\n\nIt may not be coincidence that one newspaper leads in both\ncategories: an exceptionally \"newsrich\" product makes for broad\naudience appeal, which in turn leads to high penetration. Of\ncourse, quantity must be matched by quality. This not only\nmeans good reporting and good writing; it means freshness and\nrelevance. To be indispensable, a paper must promptly tell its\nreaders many things they want to know but won't otherwise learn\nuntil much later, if ever.\n\nAt the News, we put out seven fresh editions every 24 hours,\neach one extensively changed in content. Here's a small example\nthat may surprise you: We redo the obituary page in every edition\nof the News, or seven times a day. Any obituary added runs\nthrough the next six editions until the publishing cycle has been\ncompleted.\n\nIt's vital, of course, for a newspaper to cover national and\ninternational news well and in depth. But it is also vital for\nit to do what only a local newspaper can: promptly and\nextensively chronicle the personally-important, otherwiseunreported details of community life. Doing this job well\nrequires a very broad range of news - and that means lots of\nspace, intelligently used.\n\nOur news hole was about 50% in 1987, just as it has been\nyear after year. If we were to cut it to a more typical 40%, we\nwould save approximately $4 million annually in newsprint costs.\nThat interests us not at all - and it won't interest us even if,\nfor one reason or another, our profit margins should\nsignificantly shrink.\n\nCharlie and I do not believe in flexible operating budgets,\nas in \"Non-direct expenses can be X if revenues are Y, but must\nbe reduced if revenues are Y - 5%.\" Should we really cut our news\nhole at the Buffalo News, or the quality of product and service\nat See's, simply because profits are down during a given year or\nquarter? Or, conversely, should we add a staff economist, a\ncorporate strategist, an institutional advertising campaign or\nsomething else that does Berkshire no good simply because the\nmoney currently is rolling in?\n\nThat makes no sense to us. We neither understand the adding\nof unneeded people or activities because profits are booming, nor\nthe cutting of essential people or activities because\nprofitability is shrinking. That kind of yo-yo approach is\nneither business-like nor humane. Our goal is to do what makes\nsense for Berkshire's customers and employees at all times, and\nnever to add the unneeded. (\"But what about\nthe corporate jet\n?\"\nyou rudely ask. Well, occasionally a man must rise above\nprinciple.)",

    "content": "Sources of Reported Earnings\n\nAlthough the News' revenues have grown only moderately since\n1984, superb management by Stan Lipsey, its publisher, has\nproduced excellent profit growth. For several years, I have\nincorrectly predicted that profit margins at the News would fall.\nThis year I will not let vou down: Margins will, without\nquestion, shrink in 1988 and profit may fall as well.\nSkyrocketing newsprint costs will be the major cause.\n\no\nFechheimer Bros. Company is another of our family\nbusinesses - and, like the Blumkins, what a family. Three\ngenerations of Heldmans have for decades consistently, built the\nsales and profits of this manufacturer and distributor of\nuniforms. In the year that Berkshire acquired its controlling\ninterest in Fechheimer - 1986 - profits were a record. The\nHeldmans didn't slow down after that. Last year earnings\nincreased substantially and the outlook is good for 1988.\n\nThere's nothing magic about the Uniform business; the only\nmagic is in the Heldmans. Bob, George, Gary, Roger and Fred know\nthe business inside and out, and they have fun running it. We\nare fortunate to be in partnership with them.\n\no\nChuck Huggins continues to set new records at See's, just as\nhe has ever since we put him in charge on the day of our purchase\nsome 16 years ago. In 1987, volume hit a new high at slightly\nUnder 25 million pounds. For the second year in a row, moreover,\nsame-store sales, measured in pounds, were virtually unchanged.\nIn case you are wondering, that represents improvement: In each\nof the previous six years, same-store sales had fallen.\n\nAlthough we had a particularly strong 1986 Christmas season,\nwe racked up better store-for-store comparisons in the 1987\nChristmas season than at any other time of the year. Thus, the\nseasonal factor at See's becomes even more extreme. In 1987,\nabout 85% of our profit was earned during December.\n\nCandy stores are fun to visit, but most have not been fun\nfor their owners. From what we can learn, practically no one\nbesides See's has made significant profits in recent years from\nthe operation of candy shops. Clearly, Chuck's record at See's\nis not due to a rising industry tide. Rather, it is a one-of-akind performance.\n\nHis achievement requires an excellent product - which we\nhave - but it also requires genuine affection for the customer.\nChuck is 100% customer-oriented, and his attitude sets the tone\nfor the rest of the See's organization.\n\nHere's an example of Chuck in action: At See's we regularly\nadd new pieces of candy to our mix and also cull a few to keep\nour product line at about 100 varieties. Last spring we selected\n14 items for elimination. Two, it turned out, were badly missed\nby our customers, who wasted no time in letting us know what they\nthought of our judgment: \"A pox on all in See's who participated\nin the abominable decision...;\" \"May your new truffles melt in\ntransit, may they sour in people's mouths, may your costs go up\nand your profits go down...;\" \"We are investigating the\npossibility of obtaining a mandatory injunction requiring you to\nsupply...;\" You get the picture. In all, we received many hundreds of\nletters.\n\nChuck not only reintroduced the pieces, he turned this\nmiscue into an opportunity. Each person who had written got a\ncomplete and honest explanation in return. Said Chuck's letter:\n\"Fortunately, when I make poor decisions, good things often\nhappen as a result...;\" And with the letter went a special gift\ncertificate.\n\nSee's increased prices only slightly in the last two years.\nIn 1988 we have raised prices somewhat more, though still\nmoderately. To date, sales have been weak and it may be\ndifficult for See's to improve its earnings this year.\n\no\nWorld Book, Kirby, and the Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group\nare all under the management of Ralph Schey. And what a lucky\nthing for us that they are. I told you last year that Scott\nFetzer performance in 1986 had far exceeded the expectations that\nCharlie and I had at the time of our purchase. Results in 1987\nwere even better. Pre-tax earnings rose 10% while average\ncapital employed declined significantly.\n\nRalph's mastery of the 19 businesses for which he is\nresponsible is truly amazing, and he has also attracted some\noutstanding managers to run them. We would love to find a few\nadditional units that could be put under Ralph's wing.\n\nThe businesses of Scott Fetzer are too numerous to describe\nin detail. Let's just update you on one of our favorites: At the\nend of 1987, World Book introduced its most dramatically-revised\nedition since 1962. The number of color photos was increased\nfrom 14,000 to 24,000; over 6,000 articles were revised; 840 new\ncontributors were added. Charlie and I recommend this product to\nyou and your family, as we do World Book's products for younger\nchildren, Childcraft and Early World of Learning.\n\nIn 1987, World Book unit sales in the United States\nincreased for the fifth consecutive year. International sales\nand profits also grew substantially. The outlook is good for\nScott Fetzer operations in aggregate, and for World Book in\nparticular.\n",

When the investment income that an insurer\nearns from holding on to policyholders' funds (\"the float\") is\ntaken into account, a combined ratio in the 107-111 range\ntypically produces an overall break-even result, exclusive of\nearnings on the funds provided by shareholders.\n\nThe math of the insurance business, encapsulated by the\ntable, is not very complicated. In years when the industry's\nannual gain in revenues (premiums) pokes along at 4% or 5%,\nunderwriting losses are sure to mount. That is not because auto\naccidents, fires, windstorms and the like are occurring more\nfrequently, nor has it lately been the fault of general\ninflation. Today, social and judicial inflation are the major\nculprits; the cost of entering a courtroom has simply ballooned.\nPart of the jump in cost arises from skyrocketing verdicts, and\npart from the tendency of judges and juries to expand the\ncoverage of insurance policies beyond that contemplated by the\ninsurer when the policies were written. Seeing no let-up in\neither trend, we continue to believe that the industry's revenues\nmust grow at about 10% annually for it to just hold its own in\nterms of profitability, even though general inflation may be\nrunning at a considerably lower rate.\n\nThe strong revenue gains of 1985-87 almost guaranteed the\nindustry an excellent underwriting performance in 1987 and,\nindeed, it was a banner year. But the news soured as the\nquarters rolled by: Best's estimates that year-over-year volume\nincreases were 12.9%, 11.1%, 5.7%, and 5.6%. In 1988, the\nrevenue gain is certain to be far below our 10% \"equilibrium\"\nfigure. Clearly, the party is over.",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\n\n\nHowever, earnings will not immediately sink. A lag factor\nexists in this industry: Because most policies are written for a\none-year term, higher or lower insurance prices do not have their\nfull impact on earnings until many months after they go into\neffect. Thus, to resume our metaphor, when the party ends and\nthe bar is closed, you are allowed to finish your drink. If\nresults are not hurt by a major natural catastrophe, we predict a\nsmall climb for the industry's combined ratio in 1988, followed\nby several years of larger increases.\n\nThe insurance industry is cursed with a set of dismal\neconomic characteristics that make for a poor long-term outlook:\nhundreds of competitors, ease of entry, and a product that cannot\nbe differentiated in any meaningful way. In such a commoditylike business, only a very low-cost operator or someone operating\nin a protected, and usually small, niche can sustain high\nprofitability levels.\n\nWhen shortages exist, however, even commodity businesses\nflourish. The insurance industry enjoyed that kind of climate\nfor a while but it is now gone. One of the ironies of capitalism\nis that most managers in commodity industries abhor shortage\nconditions - even though those are the only circumstances\npermitting them good returns. Whenever shortages appear, the\ntypical manager simply can't wait to expand capacity and thereby\nplug the hole through which money is showering upon him. This is\nprecisely what insurance managers did in 1985-87, confirming\nagain Disraeli's observation: \"What we learn from history is that\nwe do not learn from history.\"\n\nAt Berkshire, we work to escape the industry's commodity\neconomics in two ways. First, we differentiate our product by our\nfinancial strength, which exceeds that of all others in the\nindustry. This strength, however, is limited in its usefulness.\nIt means nothing in the personal insurance field: The buyer of\nan auto or homeowners policy is going to get his claim paid even\nif his insurer fails (as many have). It often means nothing in\nthe commercial insurance arena: When times are good, many major\ncorporate purchasers of insurance and their brokers pay scant\nattention to the insurer's ability to perform under the more\nadverse conditions that may exist, say, five years later when a\ncomplicated claim is finally resolved. (Out of sight, out of mind\n- and, later on, maybe out-of-pocket.)\n\nPeriodically, however, buyers remember Ben Franklin's\nobservation that it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright\nand recognize their need to buy promises only from insurers that\nhave enduring financial strength. It is then that we have a\nmajor competitive advantage. When a buyer really focuses on\nwhether a $10 million claim can be easily paid by his insurer\nfive or ten years down the road, and when he takes into account\nthe possibility that poor underwriting conditions may then\ncoincide with depressed financial markets and defaults by\nreinsurer, he will find only a few companies he can trust.\nAmong those, Berkshire will lead the pack.\n\nOur second method of differentiating ourselves is the total\nindifference to volume that we maintain. In 1989, we will be\nperfectly willing to write five times as much business as we\nwrite in 1988 - or only one-fifth as much. We hope, of course,\nthat conditions will allow us large volume. But we cannot\ncontrol market prices. If they are unsatisfactory, we will\nsimply do very little business. No other major insurer acts with\nequal restraint.\n\nThree conditions that prevail in insurance, but not in most\nbusinesses, allow us our flexibility. First, market share is not\nan important determinant of profitability: In this business, in\ncontrast to the newspaper or grocery businesses, the economic\nrule is not survival of the fattest. Second, in many sectors of\ninsurance, including most of those in which we operate,\ndistribution channels are not proprietary and can be easily\nentered: Small volume this year does not preclude huge volume\nnext year. Third, idle capacity - which in this industry largely\nmeans people - does not result in intolerable costs. In a way\nthat industries such as printing or steel cannot, we can operate\nat quarter-speed much of the time and still enjoy long-term\nprosperity.\n\nWe follow a price-based-on-exposure, not-on-competition\npolicy because it makes sense for our shareholders. But we're\nhappy to report that it is also pro-social. This policy means\nthat we are always available, given prices that we believe are\nadequate, to write huge volumes of almost any type of propertycasualty insurance. Many other insurers follow an in-and-out\napproach. When they are \"out\" - because of mounting losses,\ncapital inadequacy, or whatever - we are available. Of course,\nwhen others are panting to do business we are also available -\nbut at such times we often find ourselves priced above the\nmarket. In effect, we supply insurance buyers and brokers with a\nlarge reservoir of standby capacity.\n\nOne story from mid-1987 illustrates some consequences of our\npricing policy: One of the largest family-owned insurance\nbrokers in the country is headed by a fellow who has long been a\nshareholder of Berkshire. This man handles a number of large\nrisks that are candidates for placement with our New York office.\nNaturally, he does the best he can for his clients. And, just as\nnaturally, when the insurance market softened dramatically in\n1987 he found prices at other insurers lower than we were willing\nto offer. His reaction was, first, to place all of his business\nelsewhere and, second, to buy more stock in Berkshire. Had we\nbeen really competitive, he said, we would have gotten his\ninsurance business but he would not have bought our stock.\n\nBerkshire's underwriting experience was excellent in 1987,\nin part because of the lag factor discussed earlier. Our\ncombined ratio (on a statutory basis and excluding structured\nsettlements and financial reinsurance) was 105. Although the\nratio was somewhat less favorable than in 1986, when it was 103,\nour profitability improved materially in 1987 because we had the\nuse of far more float. This trend will continue to run in our\nfavor: Our ratio of float to premium volume will increase very\nsignificantly during the next few years. Thus, Berkshire's\ninsurance profits are quite likely to improve during 1988 and\n1989, even though we expect our combined ratio to rise.\n\nOur insurance business has also made some important nonfinancial gains during the last few years. Mike Goldberg, its\nmanager, has assembled a group of talented professionals to write\nlarger risks and unusual coverages. His operation is now well\nequipped to handle the lines of business that will occasionally\noffer us major opportunities.\n\nOur loss reserve development, detailed on pages 41-42, looks\nbetter this year than it has previously. But we write lots of\n\"long-tail\" business - that is, policies generating claims that\noften take many years to resolve. Examples would be product\nliability, or directors and officers liability coverages. With a\nbusiness mix like this, one year of reserve development tells you\nvery little.\n\nYou should be very suspicious of any earnings figures\nreported by insurers (including our own, as we have unfortunately\nproved to you in the past). The record of the last decade shows\nthat a great many of our best-known insurers have reported\nearnings to shareholders that later proved to be wildly\nerroneous. In most cases, these errors were totally innocent:\nThe unpredictability of our legal system makes it impossible for\neven the most conscientious insurer to come close to judging the\neventual cost of long-tail claims.\n\nNevertheless, auditors annually certify the numbers given\nthem by management and in their opinions unqualifiedly state that\nthese figures \"present fairly\" the financial position of their\nclients. The auditors use this reassuring language even though\nthey know from long and painful experience that the numbers so\ncertified are likely to differ dramatically from the true\nearnings of the period. Despite this history of error, investors\nunderstandably rely upon auditors' opinions. After all, a\ndeclaration saying that \"the statements present fairly\" hardly\nsounds equivocal to the non-accountant.",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\nThe wording in the auditor's standard opinion letter is\nscheduled to change next year. The new language represents\nimprovement, but falls far short of describing the limitations of\na casualty-insurer audit. If it is to depict the true state of\naffairs, we believe the standard opinion letter to shareholders\nof a property-casualty company should read something like: \"We\nhave relied upon representations of management in respect to the\nliabilities shown for losses and loss adjustment expenses, the\nestimate of which, in turn, very materially affects the earnings\nand financial condition herein reported. We can express no\nopinion about the accuracy of these figures. Subject to that\nimportant reservation, in our opinion, etc.\"\n\nIf lawsuits develop in respect to wildly inaccurate\nfinancial statements (which they do), auditors will definitely\nsay something of that sort in court anyway. Why should they not\nbe forthright about their role and its limitations from the\noutset?\n\nWe want to emphasize that we are not faulting auditors for\ntheir inability to accurately assess loss reserves (and therefore\nearnings). We fault them only for failing to publicly\nacknowledge that they can't do this job.\n\nFrom all appearances, the innocent mistakes that are\nconstantly made in reserving are accompanied by others that are\ndeliberate. Various charlatans have enriched themselves at the\nexpense of the investing public by exploiting, first, the\ninability of auditors to evaluate reserve figures and, second,\nthe auditors' willingness to confidently certify those figures as\nif they had the expertise to do so. We will continue to see such\nchicanery in the future. Where \"earnings\" can be created by the\nstroke of a pen, the dishonest will gather. For them, long-tail\ninsurance is heaven. The audit wording we suggest would at least\nserve to put investors on guard against these predators.\n\nThe taxes that insurance companies pay - which increased\nmaterially, though on a delayed basis, upon enactment of the Tax\nReform Act of 1986 - took a further turn for the worse at the end\nof 1987. We detailed the 1986 changes in last year's report. We\nalso commented on the irony of a statute that substantially\nincreased 1987 reported earnings for insurers even as it\nmaterially reduced both their long-term earnings potential and\ntheir business value. At Berkshire, the temporarily-helpful\n\"fresh start\" adjustment inflated 1987 earnings by $8.2 million.\n\nIn our opinion, the 1986 Act was the most important economic\nevent affecting the insurance industry over the past decade. The\n1987 Bill further reduced the intercorporate dividends-received\ncredit from 80% to 70%, effective January 1,1988, except for\ncases in which the taxpayer owns at least 20% of an investee.\n\nInvestors who have owned stocks or bonds through corporate\nintermediaries other than qualified investment companies have\nalways been disadvantaged in comparison to those owning the same\nsecurities directly. The penalty applying to indirect ownership\nwas greatly increased by the 1986 Tax Bill and, to a lesser\nextent, by the 1987 Bill, particularly in instances where the\nintermediary is an insurance company. We have no way of\noffsetting this increased level of taxation. It simply means\nthat a given set of pre-tax investment returns will now translate\ninto much poorer after-tax results for our shareholders.\n\nAll in all, we expect to do well in the insurance business,\nthough our record is sure to be uneven. The immediate outlook is\nfor substantially lower volume but reasonable earnings\nimprovement. The decline in premium volume will accelerate after\nour quota-share agreement with Fireman's Fund expires in 1989.\nAt some point, likely to be at least a few years away, we may see\nsome major opportunities, for which we are now much better\nprepared than we were in 1985.\n",

    "content": "\nMarketable Securities - Permanent Holdings\n\nWhenever Charlie and I buy common stocks for Berkshire's\ninsurance companies (leaving aside arbitrage purchases, discussed\nlater) we approach the transaction as if we were buying into a\nprivate business. We look at the economic prospects of the\nbusiness, the people in charge of running it, and the price we\nmust pay. We do not have in mind any time or price for sale.\nIndeed, we are willing to hold a stock indefinitely so long as we\nexpect the business to increase in intrinsic value at a\nsatisfactory rate. When investing, we view ourselves as business\nanalysts - not as market analysts, not as macroeconomic analysts,\nand not even as security analysts.\n\nOur approach makes an active trading market useful, since it\nperiodically presents us with mouth-watering opportunities. But\nby no means is it essential: a prolonged suspension of trading in\nthe securities we hold would not bother us any more than does the\nlack of daily quotations on World Book or Fechheimer.\nEventually, our economic fate will be determined by the economic\nfate of the business we own, whether our ownership is partial or\ntotal.\n\nBen Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the\nmental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be\nmost conducive to investment success. He said that you should\nimagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably\naccommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a\nprivate business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and\nnames a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell\nyou his.\n\nEven though the business that the two of you own may have\neconomic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market's quotations\nwill be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has\nincurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can\nsee only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in\nthat mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears\nthat you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains.\nAt other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble\nahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he\nwill name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will\nunload your interest on him.\n\nMr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn't\nmind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you\ntoday, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are\nstrictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manicdepressive his behavior, the better for you.\n\nBut, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning\nor everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is\nthere to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not\nhis wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day\nin a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him\nor to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you\nfall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren't certain that you\nunderstand and can value your business far better than Mr.\nMarket, you don't belong in the game. As they say in poker, \"If\nyou've been in the game 30 minutes and you don't know who the\npatsy is,\nyou're\nthe patsy.\"\n\nBen's Mr. Market allegory may seem out-of-date in today's\ninvestment world, in which most professionals and academicians\ntalk of efficient markets, dynamic hedging and betas. Their\ninterest in such matters is understandable, since techniques\nshrouded in mystery clearly have value to the purveyor of\ninvestment advice. After all, what witch doctor has ever\nachieved fame and fortune by simply advising \"Take two aspirins\"?\n\nThe value of market esoterica to the consumer of investment\nadvice is a different story. In my opinion, investment success\nwill not be produced by arcane formulae, computer programs or\nsignals flashed by the price behavior of stocks and markets.\nRather an investor will succeed by coupling good business\njudgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior\nfrom the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the\nmarketplace. In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found\nit highly useful to keep Ben's Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.\n\nFollowing Ben's teachings, Charlie and I let our marketable\nequities tell us by their operating results - not by their daily,\nor even yearly, price quotations - whether our investments are\nsuccessful. The market may ignore business success for a while,\nbut eventually will confirm it. As Ben said: \"In the short run,\nthe market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a\nweighing machine.\" The speed at which a business's success is\nrecognized, furthermore, is not that important as long as the\ncompany's intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory rate.\nIn fact, delayed recognition can be an advantage: It may give us\nthe chance to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price.\n\nSometimes, of course, the market may judge a business to be\nmore valuable than the underlying facts would indicate it is. In\nsuch a case, we will sell our holdings. Sometimes, also, we will\nsell a security that is fairly valued or even undervalued because\nwe require funds for a still more undervalued investment or one\nwe believe we understand better.\n\nWe need to emphasize, however, that we do not sell holdings\njust because they have appreciated or because we have held them\nfor a long time. (Of Wall Street maxims the most foolish may be\n\"You can't go broke taking a profit.\") We are quite content to\nhold any security indefinitely, so long as the prospective return\non equity capital of the underlying business is satisfactory,\nmanagement is competent and honest, and the market does not\novervalue the business.\n\nHowever, our insurance companies own three marketable common\nstocks that we would not sell even though they became far\noverpriced in the market. In effect, we view these investments\nexactly like our successful controlled businesses - a permanent\npart of Berkshire rather than merchandise to be disposed of once\nMr. Market offers us a sufficiently high price. To that, I will\nadd one qualifier: These stocks are held by our insurance\ncompanies and we would, if absolutely necessary, sell portions of\nour holdings to pay extraordinary insurance losses. We intend,\nhowever, to manage our affairs so that sales are never required.\n\nA determination to have and to hold, which Charlie and I\nshare, obviously involves a mixture of personal and financial\nconsiderations. To some, our stand may seem highly eccentric.\n(Charlie and I have long followed David Oglivy's advice: \"Develop\nyour eccentricities while you are young. That way, when you get\nold, people won't think you're going ga-ga.\") Certainly, in the\ntransaction-fixated Wall Street of recent years, our posture must\nseem odd: To many in that arena, both companies and stocks are\nseen only as raw material for trades.\n\nOur attitude, however, fits our personalities and the way we\nwant to live our lives. Churchill once said, \"You shape your\nhouses and then they shape you.\" We know the manner in which we\nwish to be shaped. For that reason, we would rather achieve a\nreturn of X while associating with people whom we strongly like\nand admire than realize 110% of X by exchanging these\nrelationships for uninteresting or unpleasant ones. And we will\nnever find people we like and admire more than some of the main\nparticipants at the three companies - our permanent holdings -\nshown below:\n\n",

    "content": "Marketable Securities - Permanent Holdings\n\n\n\nIn making both control purchases and stock purchases, we try\nto buy not only good businesses, but ones run by high-grade,\ntalented and likeable managers. If we make a mistake about the\nmanagers we link up with, the controlled company offers a certain\nadvantage because we have the power to effect change. In\npractice, however, this advantage is somewhat illusory:\nManagement changes, like marital changes, are painful, timeconsuming and chancy. In any event, at our three marketable-but\npermanent holdings, this point is moot: With Tom Murphy and Dan\nBurke at Cap Cities, Bill Snyder and Lou Simpson at GEICO, and\nKay Graham and Dick Simmons at The Washington Post, we simply\ncouldn't be in better hands.\n\nI would say that the controlled company offers two main\nadvantages. First, when we control a company we get to allocate\ncapital, whereas we are likely to have little or nothing to say\nabout this process with marketable holdings. This point can be\nimportant because the heads of many companies are not skilled in\ncapital allocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising. Most\nbosses rise to the top because they have excelled in an area such\nas marketing, production, engineering, administration or,\nsometimes, institutional politics.\n\nOnce they become CEOs, they face new responsibilities. They\nnow must make capital allocation decisions, a critical job that\nthey may have never tackled and that is not easily mastered. To\nstretch the point, it's as if the final step for a highlytalented musician was not to perform at Carnegie Hall but,\ninstead, to be named Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe lack of skill that many CEOs have at capital allocation\nis no small matter: After ten years on the job, a CEO whose\ncompany annually retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth will\nhave been responsible for the deployment of more than 60% of all\nthe capital at work in the business.\n\nCEOs who recognize their lack of capital-allocation skills\n(which not all do) will often try to compensate by turning to\ntheir staffs, management consultants, or investment bankers.\nCharlie and I have frequently observed the consequences of such\n\"help.\" On balance, we feel it is more likely to accentuate the\ncapital-allocation problem than to solve it.\n\nIn the end, plenty of unintelligent capital allocation takes\nplace in corporate America. (That's why you hear so much about\n\"restructuring.\") Berkshire, however, has been fortunate. At the\ncompanies that are our major non-controlled holdings, capital has\ngenerally been well-deployed and, in some cases, brilliantly so.\n\nThe second advantage of a controlled company over a\nmarketable security has to do with taxes. Berkshire, as a\ncorporate holder, absorbs some significant tax costs through the\nownership of partial positions that we do not when our ownership\nis 80%, or greater. Such tax disadvantages have long been with\nus, but changes in the tax code caused them to increase\nsignificantly during the past year. As a consequence, a given\nbusiness result can now deliver Berkshire financial results that\nare as much as 50% better if they come from an 80%-or-greater\nholding rather than from a lesser holding.\n\nThe disadvantages of owning marketable securities are\nsometimes offset by a huge advantage: Occasionally the stock\nmarket offers us the chance to buy non-controlling pieces of\nextraordinary businesses at truly ridiculous prices -\ndramatically below those commanded in negotiated transactions\nthat transfer control. For example, we purchased our Washington\nPost stock in 1973 at $5.63 per share, and per-share operating\nearnings in 1987 after taxes were $10.30. Similarly, Our GEICO\nstock was purchased in 1976,1979 and 1980 at an average of $6.67\nper share, and after-tax operating earnings per share last year\nwere $9.01. In cases such as these, Mr. Market has proven to be a\nmighty good friend.\n\nAn interesting accounting irony overlays a comparison of the\nreported financial results of our controlled companies with those\nof the permanent minority holdings listed above. As you can see,\nthose three stocks have a market value of over $2 billion. Yet\nthey produced only $11 million in reported after-tax earnings for\nBerkshire in 1987.\n\nAccounting rules dictate that we take into income only the\ndividends these companies pay us - which are little more than\nnominal - rather than our share of their earnings, which in 1987\namounted to well over $100 million. On the other hand,\naccounting rules provide that the carrying value of these three\nholdings - owned, as they are, by insurance companies - must be\nrecorded on our balance sheet at current market prices. The\nresult: GAAP accounting lets us reflect in our net worth the upto-date underlying values of the businesses we partially own, but\ndoes not let us reflect their underlying earnings in our income\naccount.\n\nIn the case of our controlled companies, just the opposite\nis true. Here, we show full earnings in our income account but\nnever change asset values on our balance sheet, no matter how\nmuch the value of a business might have increased since we\npurchased it.\n\nOur mental approach to this accounting schizophrenia is to\nignore GAAP figures and to focus solely on the future earning\npower of both our controlled and non-controlled businesses.\nUsing this approach, we establish our own ideas of business\nvalue, keeping these independent from both the accounting values\nshown on our books for controlled companies and the values placed\nby a sometimes foolish market on our partially-owned companies.\nIt is this business value that we hope to increase at a\nreasonable (or, preferably, unreasonable) rate in the years\nahead.\n",

    "content": "\nMarketable Securities - Other\n\nIn addition to our three permanent common stock holdings, we\nhold large quantities of marketable securities in our insurance\ncompanies. In selecting these, we can choose among five major\ncategories: (1) long-term common stock investments, (2) mediumterm fixed-income securities, (3) long-term fixed income\nsecurities, (4) short-term cash equivalents, and (5) short-term\narbitrage commitments.\n\nWe have no particular bias when it comes to choosing from\nthese categories. We just continuously search among them for the\nhighest after-tax returns as measured by \"mathematical\nexpectation,\" limiting ourselves always to investment\nalternatives we think we understand. Our criteria have nothing\nto do with maximizing immediately reportable earnings; our goal,\nrather, is to maximize eventual net worth.\n\no\nLet's look first at common stocks. During 1987 the stock\nmarket was an area of much excitement but little net movement:\nThe Dow advanced 2.3% for the year. You are aware, of course, of\nthe roller coaster ride that produced this minor change. Mr.\nMarket was on a manic rampage until October and then experienced\na sudden, massive seizure.\n\nWe have \"professional\" investors, those who manage many\nbillions, to thank for most of this turmoil. Instead of focusing\non what businesses will do in the years ahead, many prestigious\nmoney managers now focus on what they expect other money managers\nto do in the days ahead. For them, stocks are merely tokens in a\ngame, like the thimble and flatiron in Monopoly.\n\nAn extreme example of what their attitude leads to is\n\"portfolio insurance,\" a money-management strategy that many\nleading investment advisors embraced in 1986-1987. This strategy\n- which is simply an exotically-labeled version of the small\nspeculator's stop-loss order dictates that ever increasing\nportions of a stock portfolio, or their index-future equivalents,\nbe sold as prices decline. The strategy says nothing else\nmatters: A downtick of a given magnitude automatically produces a\nhuge sell order. According to the Brady Report, $60 billion to\n$90 billion of equities were poised on this hair trigger in mid October of 1987.\n\nIf you've thought that investment advisors were hired to\ninvest, you may be bewildered by this technique. After buying a\nfarm, would a rational owner next order his real estate agent to\nstart selling off pieces of it whenever a neighboring property\nwas sold at a lower price? Or would you sell your house to\nwhatever bidder was available at 9: 31 on some morning merely\nbecause at 9: 30 a similar house sold for less than it would have\nbrought on the previous day?\n\nMoves like that, however, are what portfolio insurance tells\na pension fund or university to make when it owns a portion of\nenterprises such as Ford or General Electric. The less these\ncompanies are being valued at, says this approach, the more\nvigorously they should be sold. As a \"logical\" corollary, the\napproach commands the institutions to repurchase these companies\n-\nI'm not making this up\n- once their prices have rebounded\nsignificantly. Considering that huge sums are controlled by\nmanagers following such Alice-in-Wonderland practices, is it any\nsurprise that markets sometimes behave in aberrational fashion?\n\nMany commentators, however, have drawn an incorrect\nconclusion upon observing recent events: They are fond of saying\nthat the small investor has no chance in a market now dominated\nby the erratic behavior of the big boys. This conclusion is dead\nwrong: Such markets are ideal for any investor - small or large -\nso long as he sticks to his investment knitting. Volatility\ncaused by money managers who speculate irrationally with huge\nsums will offer the true investor more chances to make\nintelligent investment moves. He can be hurt by such volatility\nonly if he is forced, by either financial or psychological\npressures, to sell at untoward times.\n\nAt Berkshire, we have found little to do in stocks during\nthe past few years. During the break in October, a few stocks\nfell to prices that interested us, but we were unable to make\nmeaningful purchases before they rebounded. At yearend 1987 we\nhad no major common stock investments (that is, over $50 million)\nother than those we consider permanent or arbitrage holdings.\nHowever, Mr. Market will offer us opportunities - you can be sure\nof that - and, when he does, we will be willing and able to\nparticipate.\n\no\nIn the meantime, our major parking place for money is\nmedium-term tax-exempt bonds, whose limited virtues I explained\nin last year's annual report. Though we both bought and sold\nsome of these bonds in 1987, our position changed little overall,\nholding around $900 million. A large portion of our bonds are\n\"grandfathered\" under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which means\nthey are fully tax-exempt. Bonds currently purchased by\ninsurance companies are not.\n\nAs an alternative to short-term cash equivalents, our\nmedium-term tax-exempts have - so far served us well. They have\nproduced substantial extra income for us and are currently worth\na bit above our cost. Regardless of their market price, we are\nready to dispose of our bonds whenever something better comes\nalong.\n\no\nWe continue to have an aversion to long-term bonds (and may\nbe making a serious mistake by not disliking medium-term bonds as\nwell). Bonds are no better than the currency in which they are\ndenominated, and nothing we have seen in the past year - or past\ndecade - makes us enthusiastic about the long-term future of U. S.\ncurrency.\n\nOur enormous trade deficit is causing various forms of\n\"claim checks\" - U. S. government and corporate bonds, bank\ndeposits, etc. - to pile up in the hands of foreigners at a\ndistressing rate. By default, our government has adopted an\napproach to its finances patterned on that of Blanche Du Bois, of\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire\n, who said, \"I have always depended on\nthe kindness of strangers.\" In this case, of course, the\n\"strangers\" are relying on the integrity of our claim checks\nalthough the plunging dollar has already made that proposition\nexpensive for them.\n\nThe faith that foreigners are placing in us may be\nmisfounded. When the claim checks outstanding grow sufficiently\nnumerous and when the issuing party can unilaterally determine\ntheir purchasing power, the pressure on the issuer to dilute\ntheir value by inflating the currency becomes almost\nirresistible. For the debtor government, the weapon of inflation\nis the economic equivalent of the \"H\" bomb, and that is why very\nfew countries have been allowed to swamp the world with debt\ndenominated in their own currency. Our past, relatively good\nrecord for fiscal integrity has let us break this rule, but the\ngenerosity accorded us is likely to intensify, rather than\nrelieve, the eventual pressure on us to inflate. If we do\nsuccumb to that pressure, it won't be just the foreign holders of\nour claim checks who will suffer. It will be all of us as well.\n\nOf course, the U. S. may take steps to stem our trade deficit\nwell before our position as a net debtor gets out of hand. (In\nthat respect, the falling dollar will help, though unfortunately\nit will hurt in other ways.) Nevertheless, our government's\nbehavior in this test of its mettle is apt to be consistent with\nits Scarlett O'Hara approach generally: \"I'll think about it\ntomorrow.\" And, almost inevitably, procrastination in facing up\nto fiscal problems will have inflationary consequences.\n\nBoth the timing and the sweep of those consequences are\nunpredictable. But our inability to quantify or time the risk\ndoes not mean we should ignore it. While recognizing the\npossibility that we may be wrong and that present interest rates\nmay adequately compensate for the inflationary risk, we retain a\ngeneral fear of long-term bonds.",

    "content": "Marketable Securities - Other\n\nWe are, however, willing to invest a moderate portion of our\nfunds in this category if we think we have a significant edge in\na specific security. That willingness explains our holdings of\nthe Washington Public Power Supply Systems #1, #2 and #3 issues,\ndiscussed in our 1984 report. We added to our WPPSS position\nduring 1987. At yearend, we had holdings with an amortized cost\nof $240 million and a market value of $316 million, paying us\ntax-exempt income of $34 million annually.\n\no\nWe continued to do well in arbitrage last year, though - or\nperhaps because - we operated on a very limited scale. We enter\ninto only a few arbitrage commitments each year and restrict\nourselves to large transactions that have been publicly\nannounced. We do not participate in situations in which greenmailers are attempting to put a target company \"in play.\"\n\nWe have practiced arbitrage on an opportunistic basis for\ndecades and, to date, our results have been quite good. Though\nwe've never made an exact calculation, I believe that overall we\nhave averaged annual pre-tax returns of at least 25% from\narbitrage. I'm quite sure we did better than that in 1987. But\nit should be emphasized that a really bad experience or two -\nsuch as many arbitrage operations suffered in late 1987 - could\nchange the figures dramatically.\n\nOur only $50 million-plus arbitrage position at yearend 1987\nwas 1,096,200 shares of Allegis, with a cost of $76 million and a\nmarket value of $78 million.\n\no\nWe had two other large holdings at yearend that do not fit\nprecisely into any of our five categories. One was various\nTexaco, Inc. bonds with short maturities, all purchased after\nTexaco went into bankruptcy. Were it not for the extraordinarily\nstrong capital position of our insurance companies, it would be\ninappropriate for us to buy defaulted bonds. At prices\nprevailing after Texaco's bankruptcy filing, however, we regarded\nthese issues as by far the most attractive bond investment\navailable to us.\n\nOn a worst-case basis with respect to the Pennzoil\nlitigation, we felt the bonds were likely to be worth about what\nwe paid for them. Given a sensible settlement, which seemed\nlikely, we expected the bonds to be worth considerably more. At\nyearend our Texaco bonds were carried on our books at $104\nmillion and had a market value of $119 million.\n\nBy far our largest - and most publicized - investment in\n1987 was a $700 million purchase of Salomon Inc 9% preferred\nstock. This preferred is convertible after three years into\nSalomon common stock at $38 per share and, if not converted, will\nbe redeemed ratably over five years beginning October 31,1995.\nFrom most standpoints, this commitment fits into the medium-term\nfixed-income securities category. In addition, we have an\ninteresting conversion possibility.\n\nWe, of course, have no special insights regarding the\ndirection or future profitability of investment banking. By\ntheir nature, the economics of this industry are far less\npredictable than those of most other industries in which we have\nmajor Commitments. This unpredictability is one of the reasons\nwhy our participation is in the form of a convertible preferred.\n\nWhat we do have a strong feeling about is the ability and\nintegrity of John Gutfreund, CEO of Salomon Inc. Charlie and I\nlike, admire and trust John. We first got to know him in 1976\nwhen he played a key role in GEICO's escape from near-bankruptcy.\nSeveral times since, we have seen John steer clients away from\ntransactions that would have been unwise, but that the client\nclearly wanted to make - even though his advice provided no fee\nto Salomon and acquiescence would have delivered a large fee.\nSuch service-above-self behavior is far from automatic in Wall\nStreet.\n\nFor the reasons Charlie outlines on page 50, at yearend we\nvalued our Salomon investment at 98% of par, $14 million less\nthan our cost. However, we believe there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that a leading, high-quality capital-raising and\nmarket-making operation can average good returns on equity. If\nso, our conversion right will eventually prove to be valuable.\n\nTwo further comments about our investments in marketable\nsecurities are appropriate. First, we give you our usual\nwarning: Our holdings have changed since yearend and will\ncontinue to do so without notice.\n\nThe second comment is related: During 1987, as in some\nearlier years, there was speculation in the press from time to\ntime about our purchase or sale of various securities. These\nstories were sometimes true, sometimes partially true, and other\ntimes completely untrue. Interestingly, there has been no\ncorrelation between the size and prestige of the publication and\nthe accuracy of the report. One dead-wrong rumor was given\nconsiderable prominence by a major national magazine, and another\nleading publication misled its readers by writing about an\narbitrage position as if it were a long-term investment\ncommitment. (In not naming names, I am observing the old warning\nthat it's not wise to pick fights with people who buy ink by the\nbarrel.)\n\nYou should understand that we simply don't comment in any\nway on rumors, whether they are true or false. If we were to\ndeny the incorrect reports and refuse comment on the correct\nones, we would in effect be commenting on all.\n\nIn a world in which big investment ideas are both limited\nand valuable, we have no interest in telling potential\ncompetitors what we are doing except to the extent required by\nlaw. We certainly don't expect others to tell us of their\ninvestment ideas. Nor would we expect a media company to\ndisclose news of acquisitions it was privately pursuing or a\njournalist to tell his competitors about stories on which he is\nworking or sources he is using.\n\nI find it uncomfortable when friends or acquaintances\nmention that they are buying X because it has been reported -\nincorrectly - that Berkshire is a buyer. However, I do not set\nthem straight. If they want to participate in whatever Berkshire\nactually is buying, they can always purchase Berkshire stock.\nBut perhaps that is too simple. Usually, I suspect, they find it\nmore exciting to buy what is being talked about. Whether that\nstrategy is more profitable is another question.\n",

    "content": "\nFinancing\n\nShortly after yearend, Berkshire sold two issues of\ndebentures, totaling $250 million. Both issues mature in 2018\nand will be retired at an even pace through sinking fund\noperations that begin in 1999. Our overall interest cost, after\nallowing for expenses of issuance, is slightly over 10%. Salomon\nwas our investment banker, and its service was excellent.\n\nDespite our pessimistic views about inflation, our taste for\ndebt is quite limited. To be sure, it is likely that Berkshire\ncould improve its return on equity by moving to a much higher,\nthough still conventional, debt-to-business-value ratio. It's\neven more likely that we could handle such a ratio, without\nproblems, under economic conditions far worse than any that have\nprevailed since the early 1930 s.\n\nBut we do not wish it to be only likely that we can meet our\nobligations; we wish that to be certain. Thus we adhere to\npolicies - both in regard to debt and all other matters - that\nwill allow us to achieve acceptable long-term results under\nextraordinarily adverse conditions, rather than optimal results\nunder a normal range of conditions.\n\nGood business or investment decisions will eventually\nproduce quite satisfactory economic results, with no aid from\nleverage. Therefore, it seems to us to be both foolish and\nimproper to risk what is important (including, necessarily, the\nwelfare of innocent bystanders such as policyholders and\nemployees) for some extra returns that are relatively\nunimportant. This view is not the product of either our\nadvancing age or prosperity: Our opinions about debt have\nremained constant.\n\nHowever, we are not phobic about borrowing. (We're far from\nbelieving that there is no fate worse than debt.) We are willing\nto borrow an amount that we believe - on a worst-case basis -\nwill pose no threat to Berkshire's well-being. Analyzing what\nthat amount might be, we can look to some important strengths\nthat would serve us well if major problems should engulf our\neconomy: Berkshire's earnings come from many diverse and wellentrenched businesses; these businesses seldom require much\ncapital investment; what debt we have is structured well; and we\nmaintain major holdings of liquid assets. Clearly, we could be\ncomfortable with a higher debt-to-business-value ratio than we\nnow have.\n\nOne further aspect of our debt policy deserves comment:\nUnlike many in the business world, we prefer to finance in\nanticipation of need rather than in reaction to it. A business\nobtains the best financial results possible by managing both\nsides of its balance sheet well. This means obtaining the\nhighest-possible return on assets and the lowest-possible cost on\nliabilities. It would be convenient if opportunities for\nintelligent action on both fronts coincided. However, reason\ntells us that just the opposite is likely to be the case: Tight\nmoney conditions, which translate into high costs for\nliabilities, will create the best opportunities for acquisitions,\nand cheap money will cause assets to be bid to the sky. Our\nconclusion: Action on the liability side should sometimes be\ntaken independent of any action on the asset side.\n\nAlas, what is \"tight\" and \"cheap\" money is far from clear at\nany particular time. We have no ability to forecast interest\nrates and - maintaining our usual open-minded spirit - believe\nthat no one else can. Therefore, we simply borrow when\nconditions seem non-oppressive and hope that we will later find\nintelligent expansion or acquisition opportunities, which - as we\nhave said - are most likely to pop up when conditions in the debt\nmarket are clearly oppressive. Our basic principle is that if\nyou want to shoot rare, fast-moving elephants, you should always\ncarry a loaded gun.\n\nOur fund-first, buy-or-expand-later policy almost always\npenalizes near-term earnings. For example, we are now earning\nabout 6 1/2% on the $250 million we recently raised at 10%, a\ndisparity that is currently costing us about $160,000 per week.\nThis negative spread is unimportant to us and will not cause us\nto stretch for either acquisitions or higher-yielding short-term\ninstruments. If we find the right sort of business elephant\nwithin the next five years or so, the wait will have been\nworthwhile.\n",

For the right business - and\nthe right people - we can provide a good home.\n\nOn the other hand, we frequently get approached about\nacquisitions that don't come close to meeting our tests: new\nventures, turnarounds, auction-like sales, and the ever-popular\n(among brokers) \"I'm-sure-something-will-work-out-if-you-peopleget-to-know-each-other.\" None of these attracts us in the least.\n\nBesides being interested in the purchases of entire\nbusinesses as described above, we are also interested in the\nnegotiated purchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of\nstock comparable to those we hold in Cap Cities and Salomon.

Most of Berkshire's major\nstockholders received their shares at yearend 1969 in a\nliquidating distribution from Buffett Partnership, Ltd.

Charlie suggested the solution\nmight lie in a California friend of his, Harry Bottle, whose\nspecial knack was never forgetting the fundamental. I met Harry\nin Los Angeles on April 17,1962, and on April 23 he was in\nBeatrice, Nebraska, running Dempster. Our problems disappeared\nalmost immediately. In my 1962 annual letter to partners, I\nnamed Harry \"Man of the Year.\"\n\nFade to 24 years later: The scene is K & W Products, a small\nBerkshire subsidiary that produces automotive compounds. For\nyears K & W did well, but in 1985-86 it stumbled badly, as it\npursued the unattainable to the neglect of the achievable.\nCharlie, who oversees K & W, knew there was no need to consult\nme. Instead, he called Harry, now 68 years old, made him CEO,\nand sat back to await the inevitable. He didn't wait long. In\n1987 K & W's profits set a record, up more than 300% from 1986.\nAnd, as profits went up, capital employed went down: K & W's\ninvestment in accounts receivable and inventories has decreased\n20%.\n\nIf we run into another managerial problem ten or twenty\nyears down the road, you know whose phone will ring.\n\n",
