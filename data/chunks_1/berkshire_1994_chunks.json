    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1994 was $1.45 billion or 13.9%.\nOver the last 30 years (that is, since present management took\nover) our per-share book value has grown from $19 to $10,083, or\nat a rate of 23% compounded annually.\n\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner,\nand I make few predictions. One we will confidently offer,\nhowever, is that the future performance of Berkshire won't come\nclose to matching the performance of the past.\n\nThe problem is not that what has worked in the past will\ncease to work in the future. To the contrary, we believe that\nour formula - the purchase at sensible prices of businesses that\nhave good underlying economics and are run by honest and able\npeople - is certain to produce reasonable success. We expect,\ntherefore, to keep on doing well.\n\nA fat wallet, however, is the enemy of superior investment\nresults. And Berkshire now has a net worth of $11.9 billion\ncompared to about $22 million when Charlie and I began to manage\nthe company. Though there are as many good businesses as ever,\nit is useless for us to make purchases that are inconsequential\nin relation to Berkshire's capital. (As Charlie regularly\nreminds me, \"If something is not worth doing at all, it's not\nworth doing well.\") We now consider a security for purchase only\nif we believe we can deploy at least $100 million in it. Given\nthat minimum, Berkshire's investment universe has shrunk\ndramatically.\n\nNevertheless, we will stick with the approach that got us\nhere and try not to relax our standards. Ted Williams, in\n\nThe Story of My Life\n, explains why: \"My argument is, to be\na good hitter, you've got to get a good ball to hit. It's the\nfirst rule in the book. If I have to bite at stuff that is out\nof my happy zone, I'm not a . 344 hitter. I might only be a . 250\nhitter.\" Charlie and I agree and will try to wait for\nopportunities that are well within our own \"happy zone.\"\n\nWe will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts,\nwhich are an expensive distraction for many investors and\nbusinessmen. Thirty years ago, no one could have foreseen the\nhuge expansion of the Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two\noil shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of\nthe Soviet Union, a one-day drop in the Dow of 508 points, or\ntreasury bill yields fluctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%.\n\nBut, surprise - none of these blockbuster events made the\nslightest dent in Ben Graham's investment principles. Nor did\nthey render unsound the negotiated purchases of fine businesses\nat sensible prices. Imagine the cost to us, then, if we had let\na fear of unknowns cause us to defer or alter the deployment of\ncapital. Indeed, we have usually made our best purchases when\napprehensions about some macro event were at a peak. Fear is the\nfoe of the faddist, but the friend of the fundamentalist.\n\nA different set of major shocks is sure to occur in the next\n30 years. We will neither try to predict these nor to profit\nfrom them. If we can identify businesses similar to those we\nhave purchased in the past, external surprises will have little\neffect on our long-term results.\n\nWhat we promise you - along with more modest gains - is that\nduring your ownership of Berkshire, you will fare just as Charlie\nand I do. If you suffer, we will suffer; if we prosper, so will\nyou. And we will not break this bond by introducing compensation\narrangements that give us a greater participation in the upside\nthan the downside.\n\nWe further promise you that our personal fortunes will\nremain overwhelmingly concentrated in Berkshire shares: We will\nnot ask you to invest with us and then put our own money\nelsewhere. In addition, Berkshire dominates both the investment\nportfolios of most members of our families and of a great many\nfriends who belonged to partnerships that Charlie and I ran in\nthe 1960's. We could not be more motivated to do our best.\n\nLuckily, we have a good base from which to work. Ten years\nago, in 1984, Berkshire's insurance companies held securities\nhaving a value of $1.7 billion, or about $1,500 per Berkshire\nshare. Leaving aside all income and capital gains from those\nsecurities, Berkshire's pre-tax earnings that year were only\nabout $6 million. We had earnings, yes, from our various\nmanufacturing, retailing and service businesses, but they were\nalmost entirely offset by the combination of underwriting losses\nin our insurance business, corporate overhead and interest\nexpense.\n\nNow we hold securities worth $18 billion, or over $15,000\nper Berkshire share. If you again exclude all income from these\nsecurities, our pre-tax earnings in 1994 were about $384 million.\nDuring the decade, employment has grown from 5,000 to 22,000\n(including eleven people at World Headquarters).\n\nWe achieved our gains through the efforts of a superb corps\nof operating managers who get extraordinary results from some\nordinary-appearing businesses. Casey Stengel described managing\na baseball team as \"getting paid for home runs other fellows\nhit.\" That's my formula at Berkshire, also.\n\nThe businesses in which we have partial interests are\nequally important to Berkshire's success. A few statistics will\nillustrate their significance: In 1994, Coca-Cola sold about 280\nbillion 8-ounce servings and earned a little less than a penny on\neach. But pennies add up. Through Berkshire's 7.8% ownership of\nCoke, we have an economic interest in 21 billion of its servings,\nwhich produce \"soft-drink earnings\" for us of nearly $200\nmillion. Similarly, by way of its Gillette stock, Berkshire has\na 7% share of the world's razor and blade market (measured by\nrevenues, not by units), a proportion according us about $250\nmillion of sales in 1994. And, at Wells Fargo, a $53 billion\nbank, our 13% ownership translates into a $7 billion \"Berkshire\nBank\" that earned about $100 million during 1994.\n\nIt's far better to own a significant portion of the Hope\ndiamond than 100% of a rhinestone, and the companies just\nmentioned easily qualify as rare gems. Best of all, we aren't\nlimited to simply a few of this breed, but instead possess a\ngrowing collection.\n\nStock prices will continue to fluctuate - sometimes sharply\n- and the economy will have its ups and down. Over time,\nhowever, we believe it highly probable that the sort of\nbusinesses we own will continue to increase in value at a\nsatisfactory rate.\n\n",

    "content": "Book Value and Intrinsic Value\n\nWe regularly report our per-share book value, an easily\ncalculable number, though one of limited use. Just as regularly,\nwe tell you that what counts is intrinsic value, a number that is\nimpossible to pinpoint but essential to estimate.\n\nFor example, in 1964, we could state with certitude that\nBerkshire's per-share book value was $19.46. However, that\nfigure considerably overstated the stock's intrinsic value since\nall of the company's resources were tied up in a sub-profitable\ntextile business. Our textile assets had neither going-concern\nnor liquidation values equal to their carrying values. In 1964,\nthen, anyone inquiring into the soundness of Berkshire's balance\nsheet might well have deserved the answer once offered up by a\nHollywood mogul of dubious reputation: \"Don't worry, the\nliabilities are solid.\"\n\nToday, Berkshire's situation has reversed: Many of the\nbusinesses we control are worth far more than their carrying\nvalue. (Those we don't control, such as Coca-Cola or Gillette,\nare carried at current market values.) We continue to give you\nbook value figures, however, because they serve as a rough,\nalbeit significantly understated, tracking measure for Berkshire's\nintrinsic value. Last year, in fact, the two measures moved in\nconcert: Book value gained 13.9%, and that was the approximate\ngain in intrinsic value also.\n\nWe define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the\ncash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining\nlife. Anyone calculating intrinsic value necessarily comes up\nwith a highly subjective figure that will change both as\nestimates of future cash flows are revised and as interest rates\nmove. Despite its fuzziness, however, intrinsic value is allimportant and is the only logical way to evaluate the relative\nattractiveness of investments and businesses.\n\nTo see how historical input (book value) and future output\n(intrinsic value) can diverge, let's look at another form of\ninvestment, a college education. Think of the education's cost\nas its \"book value.\" If it is to be accurate, the cost should\ninclude the earnings that were foregone by the student because he\nchose college rather than a job.\n\nFor this exercise, we will ignore the important non-economic\nbenefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic\nvalue. First, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate\nwill receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an\nestimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his\neducation. That gives us an excess earnings figure, which must\nthen be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to\ngraduation day. The dollar result equals the intrinsic economic\nvalue of the education.\n\nSome graduates will find that the book value of their\neducation exceeds its intrinsic value, which means that whoever\npaid for the education didn't get his money's worth. In other\ncases, the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its\nbook value, a result that proves capital was wisely deployed. In\nall cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an\nindicator of intrinsic value.\n\nNow let's get less academic and look at Scott Fetzer, an\nexample from Berkshire's own experience. This account will not\nonly illustrate how the relationship of book value and intrinsic\nvalue can change but also will provide an accounting lesson that\nI know you have been breathlessly awaiting. Naturally, I've\nchosen here to talk about an acquisition that has turned out to\nbe a huge winner.\n\nBerkshire purchased Scott Fetzer at the beginning of 1986.\nAt the time, the company was a collection of 22 businesses, and\ntoday we have exactly the same line-up - no additions and no\ndisposals. Scott Fetzer's main operations are World Book, Kirby,\nand Campbell Hausfeld, but many other units are important\ncontributors to earnings as well.\n\nWe paid $315.2 million for Scott Fetzer, which at the time\nhad $172.6 million of book value. The $142.6 million premium we\nhanded over indicated our belief that the company's intrinsic\nvalue was close to double its book value.\n\nIn the table below we trace the book value of Scott Fetzer,\nas well as its earnings and dividends, since our purchase.\n\n(1) (4)\nBeginning (2) (3) Ending\nYear Book Value Earnings Dividends Book Value\n\n---- ---------- -------- --------- ----------\n(In $ Millions) (1)+(2)-(3)\n\n1986 ............... $172.6 $ 40.3 $125.0 $ 87.9\n1987 ............... 87.9 48.6 41.0 95.5\n1988 ............... 95.5 58.0 35.0 118.6\n1989 ............... 118.6 58.5 71.5 105.5\n1990 ............... 105.5 61.3 33.5 133.3\n1991 ............... 133.3 61.4 74.0 120.7\n1992 ............... 120.7 70.5 80.0 111.2\n1993 ............... 111.2 77.5 98.0 90.7\n1994 ............... 90.7 79.3 76.0 94.0\n\nBecause it had excess cash when our deal was made, Scott\nFetzer was able to pay Berkshire dividends of $125 million in\n1986, though it earned only $40.3 million. I should mention that\nwe have not introduced leverage into Scott Fetzer's balance\nsheet. In fact, the company has gone from very modest debt when\nwe purchased it to virtually no debt at all (except for debt used\nby its finance subsidiary). Similarly, we have not sold plants\nand leased them back, nor sold receivables, nor the like.\nThroughout our years of ownership, Scott Fetzer has operated as a\nconservatively-financed and liquid enterprise.\n\nAs you can see, Scott Fetzer's earnings have increased\nsteadily since we bought it, but book value has not grown\ncommensurately. Consequently, return on equity, which was\nexceptional at the time of our purchase, has now become truly\nextraordinary. Just how extraordinary is illustrated by\ncomparing Scott Fetzer's performance to that of the Fortune 500,\na group it would qualify for if it were a stand-alone company.\n\nHad Scott Fetzer been on the 1993 500 list - the latest\navailable for inspection - the company's return on equity would\nhave ranked 4 th. But that is far from the whole story. The top\nthree companies in return on equity were Insilco, LTV and Gaylord\nContainer, each of which emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 and none\nof which achieved meaningful earnings that year except for those\nthey realized when they were accorded debt forgiveness in\nbankruptcy proceedings. Leaving aside such non-operating\nwindfalls, Scott Fetzer's return on equity would have ranked it\nfirst on the Fortune 500, well ahead of number two. Indeed,\nScott Fetzer's return on equity was double that of the company\nranking tenth.\n\nYou might expect that Scott Fetzer's success could only be\nexplained by a cyclical peak in earnings, a monopolistic\nposition, or leverage. But no such circumstances apply. Rather,\nthe company's success comes from the managerial expertise of CEO\nRalph Schey, of whom I'll tell you more later.\n\nFirst, however, the promised accounting lesson: When we\npaid a $142.6 million premium over book value for Scott Fetzer,\nthat figure had to be recorded on Berkshire's balance sheet.\nI'll spare you the details of how this worked (these were laid\nout in an appendix to our 1986 Annual Report) and get to the\nbottom line: After a premium is initially recorded, it must in\nalmost all cases be written off over time through annual charges\nthat are shown as costs in the acquiring company's earnings\nstatement.\n\nThe following table shows, first, the annual charges\nBerkshire has made to gradually extinguish the Scott Fetzer\nacquisition premium and, second, the premium that remains on our\nbooks. These charges have no effect on cash or the taxes we pay,\nand are not, in our view, an economic cost (though many\naccountants would disagree with us). They are merely a way for\nus to reduce the carrying value of Scott Fetzer on our books so\nthat the figure will eventually match the net worth that Scott\nFetzer actually employs in its business.\n\nBeginning Purchase-Premium Ending\nPurchase Charge to Purchase\nYear Premium Berkshire Earnings Premium\n\n---- --------- ------------------ --------\n(In $ Millions)\n\n1986 ................ $142.6 $ 11.6 $131.0\n1987 ................ 131.0 7.1 123.9\n1988 ................ 123.9 7.9 115.9\n1989 ................ 115.9 7.0 108.9\n1990 ................ 108.9 7.1 101.9\n1991 ................ 101.9 6.9 95.0\n1992 ................ 95.0 7.7 87.2\n1993 ................ 87.2 28.1 59.1\n1994 ................ 59.1 4.9 54.2\n\nNote that by the end of 1994 the premium was reduced to\n$54.2 million. When this figure is added to Scott Fetzer's yearend book value of $94 million, the total is $148.2 million, which\nis the current carrying value of Scott Fetzer on Berkshire's\nbooks. That amount is less than half of our carrying value for\nthe company when it was acquired. Yet Scott Fetzer is now\nearning about twice what it then did. Clearly, the intrinsic\nvalue of the business has consistently grown, even though we have\njust as consistently marked down its carrying value through\npurchase-premium charges that reduced Berkshire's earnings and\nnet worth.\n\nThe difference between Scott Fetzer's intrinsic value and\nits carrying value on Berkshire's books is now huge. As I\nmentioned earlier - but am delighted to mention again - credit\nfor this agreeable mismatch goes to Ralph Schey, a focused, smart\nand high-grade manager.\n\nThe reasons for Ralph's success are not complicated. Ben\nGraham taught me 45 years ago that in investing it is not\nnecessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary\nresults. In later life, I have been surprised to find that this\nstatement holds true in business management as well. What a\nmanager must do is handle the basics well and not get diverted.\nThat's precisely Ralph's formula. He establishes the right goals\nand never forgets what he set out to do. On the personal side,\nRalph is a joy to work with. He's forthright about problems and\nis self-confident without being self-important.\n\nHe is also experienced. Though I don't know Ralph's age, I\ndo know that, like many of our managers, he is over 65. At\nBerkshire, we look to performance, not to the calendar. Charlie\nand I, at 71 and 64 respectively, now keep George Foreman's\npicture on our desks. You can make book that our scorn for a\nmandatory retirement age will grow stronger every year.\n\n",

    "content": "Intrinsic Value and Capital Allocation\n\nUnderstanding intrinsic value is as important for managers\nas it is for investors. When managers are making capital\nallocation decisions - including decisions to repurchase shares -\nit's vital that they act in ways that increase per-share\nintrinsic value and avoid moves that decrease it. This principle\nmay seem obvious but we constantly see it violated. And, when\nmisallocations occur, shareholders are hurt.\n\nFor example, in contemplating business mergers and\nacquisitions, many managers tend to focus on whether the\ntransaction is immediately dilutive or anti-dilutive to earnings\nper share (or, at financial institutions, to per-share book\nvalue). An emphasis of this sort carries great dangers. Going\nback to our college-education example, imagine that a 25-year-old\nfirst-year MBA student is considering merging his future economic\ninterests with those of a 25-year-old day laborer. The MBA\nstudent, a non-earner, would find that a \"share-for-share\" merger\nof his equity interest in himself with that of the day laborer\nwould enhance his near-term earnings (in a big way!). But what\ncould be sillier for the student than a deal of this kind?\n\nIn corporate transactions, it's equally silly for the wouldbe purchaser to focus on current earnings when the prospective\nacquiree has either different prospects, different amounts of\nnon-operating assets, or a different capital structure. At\nBerkshire, we have rejected many merger and purchase\nopportunities that would have boosted current and near-term\nearnings but that would have reduced per-share intrinsic value.\nOur approach, rather, has been to follow Wayne Gretzky's advice:\n\"Go to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is.\" As a\nresult, our shareholders are now many billions of dollars richer\nthan they would have been if we had used the standard catechism.\n\nThe sad fact is that most major acquisitions display an\negregious imbalance: They are a bonanza for the shareholders of\nthe acquiree; they increase the income and status of the\nacquirer's management; and they are a honey pot for the\ninvestment bankers and other professionals on both sides. But,\nalas, they usually reduce the wealth of the acquirer's shareholders,\noften to a substantial extent. That happens because the acquirer\ntypically gives up more intrinsic value than it receives. Do that\nenough, says John Medlin, the retired head of Wachovia Corp., and\n\"you are running a chain letter in reverse.\"\n\nOver time, the skill with which a company's managers\nallocate capital has an enormous impact on the enterprise's\nvalue. Almost by definition, a really good business generates\nfar more money (at least after its early years) than it can use\ninternally. The company could, of course, distribute the money\nto shareholders by way of dividends or share repurchases. But\noften the CEO asks a strategic planning staff, consultants or\ninvestment bankers whether an acquisition or two might make\nsense. That's like asking your interior decorator whether you\nneed a $50,000 rug.\n\nThe acquisition problem is often compounded by a biological\nbias: Many CEO's attain their positions in part because they\npossess an abundance of animal spirits and ego. If an executive\nis heavily endowed with these qualities - which, it should be\nacknowledged, sometimes have their advantages - they won't\ndisappear when he reaches the top. When such a CEO is encouraged\nby his advisors to make deals, he responds much as would a\nteenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex\nlife. It's not a push he needs.\n\nSome years back, a CEO friend of mine - in jest, it must be\nsaid - unintentionally described the pathology of many big deals.\nThis friend, who ran a property-casualty insurer, was explaining\nto his directors why he wanted to acquire a certain life\ninsurance company. After droning rather unpersuasively through\nthe economics and strategic rationale for the acquisition, he\nabruptly abandoned the script. With an impish look, he simply\nsaid: \"Aw, fellas, all the other kids have one.\"\n\nAt Berkshire, our managers will continue to earn\nextraordinary returns from what appear to be ordinary businesses.\nAs a first step, these managers will look for ways to deploy\ntheir earnings advantageously in their businesses. What's left,\nthey will send to Charlie and me. We then will try to use those\nfunds in ways that build per-share intrinsic value. Our goal\nwill be to acquire either part or all of businesses that we\nbelieve we understand, that have good, sustainable underlying\neconomics, and that are run by managers whom we like, admire and\ntrust.\n\n",

    "content": "Compensation\n\nAt Berkshire, we try to be as logical about compensation as\nabout capital allocation. For example, we compensate Ralph Schey\nbased upon the results of Scott Fetzer rather than those of\nBerkshire. What could make more sense, since he's responsible\nfor one operation but not the other? A cash bonus or a stock\noption tied to the fortunes of Berkshire would provide totally\ncapricious rewards to Ralph. He could, for example, be hitting\nhome runs at Scott Fetzer while Charlie and I rang up mistakes at\nBerkshire, thereby negating his efforts many times over.\nConversely, why should option profits or bonuses be heaped upon\nRalph if good things are occurring in other parts of Berkshire\nbut Scott Fetzer is lagging?\n\nIn setting compensation, we like to hold out the promise of\nlarge carrots, but make sure their delivery is tied directly to\nresults in the area that a manager controls. When capital\ninvested in an operation is significant, we also both charge\nmanagers a high rate for incremental capital they employ and\ncredit them at an equally high rate for capital they release.\n\nThe product of this money's-not-free approach is definitely\nvisible at Scott Fetzer. If Ralph can employ incremental funds\nat good returns, it pays him to do so: His bonus increases when\nearnings on additional capital exceed a meaningful hurdle charge.\nBut our bonus calculation is symmetrical: If incremental\ninvestment yields sub-standard returns, the shortfall is costly\nto Ralph as well as to Berkshire. The consequence of this twoway arrangement is that it pays Ralph - and pays him well - to\nsend to Omaha any cash he can't advantageously use in his\nbusiness.\n\nIt has become fashionable at public companies to describe\nalmost every compensation plan as aligning the interests of\nmanagement with those of shareholders. In our book, alignment\nmeans being a partner in both directions, not just on the upside.\nMany \"alignment\" plans flunk this basic test, being artful forms\nof \"heads I win, tails you lose.\"\n\nA common form of misalignment occurs in the typical stock\noption arrangement, which does not periodically increase the\noption price to compensate for the fact that retained earnings\nare building up the wealth of the company. Indeed, the\ncombination of a ten-year option, a low dividend payout, and\ncompound interest can provide lush gains to a manager who has\ndone no more than tread water in his job. A cynic might even\nnote that when payments to owners are held down, the profit to\nthe option-holding manager increases. I have yet to see this\nvital point spelled out in a proxy statement asking shareholders\nto approve an option plan.\n\nI can't resist mentioning that our compensation arrangement\nwith Ralph Schey was worked out in about five minutes,\nimmediately upon our purchase of Scott Fetzer and without the\n\"help\" of lawyers or compensation consultants. This arrangement\nembodies a few very simple ideas - not the kind of terms favored\nby consultants who cannot easily send a large bill unless they\nhave established that you have a large problem (and one, of\ncourse, that requires an annual review). Our agreement with\nRalph has never been changed. It made sense to him and to me in\n1986, and it makes sense now. Our compensation arrangements with\nthe managers of all our other units are similarly simple, though\nthe terms of each agreement vary to fit the economic\ncharacteristics of the business at issue, the existence in some\ncases of partial ownership of the unit by managers, etc.\n\nIn all instances, we pursue rationality. Arrangements that\npay off in capricious ways, unrelated to a manager's personal\naccomplishments, may well be welcomed by certain managers. Who,\nafter all, refuses a free lottery ticket? But such arrangements\nare wasteful to the company and cause the manager to lose focus\non what should be his real areas of concern. Additionally,\nirrational behavior at the parent may well encourage imitative\nbehavior at subsidiaries.\n\nAt Berkshire, only Charlie and I have the managerial\nresponsibility for the entire business. Therefore, we are the\nonly parties who should logically be compensated on the basis of\nwhat the enterprise does as a whole. Even so, that is not a\ncompensation arrangement we desire. We have carefully designed\nboth the company and our jobs so that we do things we enjoy with\npeople we like. Equally important, we are forced to do very few\nboring or unpleasant tasks. We are the beneficiaries as well of\nthe abundant array of material and psychic perks that flow to the\nheads of corporations. Under such idyllic conditions, we don't\nexpect shareholders to ante up loads of compensation for which we\nhave no possible need.\n\nIndeed, if we were not paid at all, Charlie and I would be\ndelighted with the cushy jobs we hold. At bottom, we subscribe\nto Ronald Reagan's creed: \"It's probably true that hard work\nnever killed anyone, but I figure why take the chance.\"\n\n",

    "content": "\"Look-Through\" Earnings\n\nIn past reports, we've discussed look-through earnings, which\nwe believe more accurately portray the earnings of Berkshire than\ndoes our GAAP result. As we calculate them, look-through earnings\nconsist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\nsection, plus; (2) the retained operating earnings of major\ninvestees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our\nprofits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by\nBerkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead been\ndistributed to us. The \"operating earnings\" of which we speak here\nexclude capital gains, special accounting items and major\nrestructuring charges.\n\nIf our intrinsic value is to grow at our target rate of 15%,\nour look-through earnings, over time, must also increase at about\nthat pace. When I first explained this concept a few years back, I\ntold you that meeting this 15% goal would require us to generate\nlook-through earnings of about $1.8 billion by 2000. Because we've\nsince issued about 3% more shares, that figure has grown to $1.85\nbillion.\n\nWe are now modestly ahead of schedule in meeting our goal, but\nto a significant degree that is because our super-cat insurance\nbusiness has recently delivered earnings far above trend-line\nexpectancy (an outcome I will discuss in the next section). Giving\ndue weight to that abnormality, we still expect to hit our target\nbut that, of course, is no sure thing.\n\nThe following table shows how we calculate look-through\nearnings, though I warn you that the figures are necessarily very\nrough. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been\nincluded in the operating earnings itemized on page 12, mostly\nunder \"Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.\")\n\nBerkshire's Share\nof Undistributed\nBerkshire's Approximate Operating Earnings\nBerkshire's Major Investees Ownership at Yearend (in millions)\n--------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------\n\n1994 1993 1994 1993\n------ ------ ------ ------\nAmerican Express Company ...... 5.5% 2.4% $ 25(2) $ 16\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ...... 13.0% 13.0% 85 83(2)\nThe Coca-Cola Company ......... 7.8% 7.2% 116(2) 94\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 6.3%(1) 6.8%(1) 47(2) 41(2)\nGannett Co., Inc. ............. 4.9% --- 4(2) ---\nGEICO Corp. ................... 50.2% 48.4% 63(3) 76(3)\nThe Gillette Company .......... 10.8% 10.9% 51 44\nPNC Bank Corp. ................ 8.3% --- 10(2) ---\nThe Washington Post Company ... 15.2% 14.8% 18 15\nWells Fargo & Company ......... 13.3% 12.2% 73 53(2)\n------ ------\nBerkshire's share of undistributed\nearnings of major investees $ 492 $422\nHypothetical tax on these undistributed\ninvestee earnings(4) (68) (59)\nReported operating earnings of Berkshire 606 478\n------- ------\nTotal look-through earnings of Berkshire $1,030 $ 841\n\n(1) Does not include shares allocable to the minority interest\nat Wesco\n(2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n(3) Excludes realized capital gains, which have been both\nrecurring and significant\n(4) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire pays\non the dividends it receives\n\n",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\nAs we've explained in past reports, what counts in our\ninsurance business is, first, the amount of \"float\" we develop and,\nsecond, its cost to us. Float is money we hold but don't own. In\nan insurance operation, float arises because most policies require\nthat premiums be prepaid and, more importantly, because it usually\ntakes time for an insurer to hear about and resolve loss claims.\n\nTypically, the premiums that an insurer takes in do not cover\nthe losses and expenses it must pay. That leaves it running an\n\"underwriting loss\" - and that loss is the cost of float.\n\nAn insurance business is profitable over time if its cost of\nfloat is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to\nobtain funds. But the business has a negative value if the cost of\nits float is higher than market rates for money.\n\nAs the numbers in the following table show, Berkshire's\ninsurance business has been an enormous winner. For the table, we\nhave compiled our float - which we generate in exceptional amounts\nrelative to our premium volume - by adding loss reserves, loss\nadjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned\npremium reserves and then subtracting agents' balances, prepaid\nacquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to\nassumed reinsurance. Our cost of float is determined by our\nunderwriting loss or profit. In those years when we have had an\nunderwriting profit, such as the last two, our cost of float has been\nnegative, and we have determined our insurance earnings by adding\nunderwriting profit to float income.\n\n(1) (2) Yearend Yield\nUnderwriting Approximate on Long-Term\nLoss Average Float Cost of Funds Govt.

But our\nmessage this year echoes the one we delivered in 1993: Though we\nhave a fine insurance business, it is not as good as it currently\nlooks.\n\nThe reason we must repeat this caution is that our \"super-cat\"\nbusiness (which sells policies that insurance and reinsurance\ncompanies buy to protect themselves from the effects of megacatastrophes) was again highly profitable. Since truly major\ncatastrophes occur infrequently, our super-cat business can be\nexpected to show large profits in most years but occasionally to\nrecord a huge loss. In other words, the attractiveness of our\nsuper-cat business will take many years to measure. Certainly 1994\nshould be regarded as close to a best-case. Our only significant\nlosses arose from the California earthquake in January. I will add\nthat we do not expect to suffer a major loss from the early-1995\nKobe earthquake.\n\nSuper-cat policies are small in number, large in size and nonstandardized. Therefore, the underwriting of this business\nrequires far more judgment than, say, the underwriting of auto\npolicies, for which a mass of data is available. Here Berkshire\nhas a major advantage: Ajit Jain, our super-cat manager, whose\nunderwriting skills are the finest. His value to us is simply\nenormous.\n\nIn addition, Berkshire has a special advantage in the supercat business because of our towering financial strength, which\nhelps us in two ways. First, a prudent insurer will want its\nprotection against true mega-catastrophes - such as a $50 billion\nwindstorm loss on Long Island or an earthquake of similar cost in\nCalifornia - to be absolutely certain. But that same insurer knows\nthat the disaster making it dependent on a large super-cat recovery\nis also the disaster that could cause many reinsurers to default.\nThere's not much sense in paying premiums for coverage that will\nevaporate precisely when it is needed. So the certainty that\nBerkshire will be both solvent and liquid after a catastrophe of\nunthinkable proportions is a major competitive advantage for us.\n\nThe second benefit of our capital strength is that we can\nwrite policies for amounts that no one else can even consider. For\nexample, during 1994, a primary insurer wished to buy a short-term\npolicy for $400 million of California earthquake coverage and we\nwrote the policy immediately. We know of no one else in the world\nwho would take a $400 million risk, or anything close to it, for\ntheir own account.\n\nGenerally, brokers attempt to place coverage for large amounts\nby spreading the burden over a number of small policies. But, at\nbest, coverage of that sort takes considerable time to arrange. In\nthe meantime, the company desiring reinsurance is left holding a\nrisk it doesn't want and that may seriously threaten its wellbeing. At Berkshire, on the other hand, we will quote prices for\ncoverage as great as $500 million on the same day that we are asked\nto bid. No one else in the industry will do the same.\n\nBy writing coverages in large lumps, we obviously expose\nBerkshire to lumpy financial results. That's totally acceptable to\nus: Too often, insurers (as well as other businesses) follow suboptimum strategies in order to \"smooth\" their reported earnings.\nBy accepting the prospect of volatility, we expect to earn higher\nlong-term returns than we would by pursuing predictability.\n\nGiven the risks we accept, Ajit and I constantly focus on our\n\"worst case,\" knowing, of course, that it is difficult to judge\nwhat this is, since you could conceivably have a Long Island\nhurricane, a California earthquake, and Super Cat X all in the same\nyear. Additionally, insurance losses could be accompanied by noninsurance troubles. For example, were we to have super-cat losses\nfrom a large Southern California earthquake, they might well be\naccompanied by a major drop in the value of our holdings in See's,\nWells Fargo and Freddie Mac.\n\nAll things considered, we believe our worst-case\ninsurance\n\nloss from a super-cat is now about $600 million after-tax, an\namount that would slightly exceed Berkshire's annual earnings from\nother sources. If you are not comfortable with this level of\nexposure, the time to sell your Berkshire stock is now, not after\nthe inevitable mega-catastrophe.\n\nOur super-cat volume will probably be down in 1995. Prices\nfor garden-variety policies have fallen somewhat, and the torrent\nof capital that was committed to the reinsurance business a few\nyears ago will be inclined to chase premiums, irrespective of their\nadequacy. Nevertheless, we have strong relations with an important\ngroup of clients who will provide us with a substantial amount of\nbusiness in 1995.\n\nBerkshire's other insurance operations had excellent results\nin 1994. Our homestate operation, led by Rod Eldred; our workers'\ncompensation business, headed by Brad Kinstler; our credit card\noperation, managed by the Kizer family; National Indemnity's\ntraditional auto and general liability business, led by Don Wurster\n- all of these generated significant underwriting profits\naccompanied by substantial float.\n\nWe can conclude this section as we did last year: All in all,\nwe have a first-class insurance business. Though its results will\nbe highly volatile, this operation possesses an intrinsic value\nthat exceeds its book value by a large amount - larger, in fact,\nthan is the case at any other Berkshire business.\n\n",

We like a business with enduring competitive\nadvantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people. When\nthese attributes exist, and when we can make purchases at sensible\nprices, it is hard to go wrong (a challenge we periodically manage\nto overcome).\n\nInvestors should remember that their scorecard is not computed\nusing Olympic-diving methods: Degree-of-difficulty doesn't count.\nIf you are right about a business whose value is largely dependent\non a single key factor that is both easy to understand and\nenduring, the payoff is the same as if you had correctly analyzed\nan investment alternative characterized by many constantly shifting\nand complex variables.\n\nWe try to\nprice,\nrather than\ntime,\npurchases. In our view, it\nis folly to forego buying shares in an outstanding business whose\nlong-term future is predictable, because of short-term worries\nabout an economy or a stock market that we know to be\nunpredictable. Why scrap an informed decision because of an\nuninformed guess?\n\nWe purchased National Indemnity in 1967, See's in 1972,\nBuffalo News in 1977, Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983, and Scott\nFetzer in 1986 because those are the years they became available\nand because we thought the prices they carried were acceptable. In\neach case, we pondered what the business was likely to do, not what\nthe Dow, the Fed, or the economy might do. If we see this approach\nas making sense in the purchase of businesses in their entirety,\nwhy should we change tack when we are purchasing small pieces of\nwonderful businesses in the stock market?\n\nBefore looking at new investments, we consider adding to old\nones. If a business is attractive enough to buy once, it may well\npay to repeat the process. We would love to increase our economic\ninterest in See's or Scott Fetzer, but we haven't found a way to\nadd to a 100% holding. In the stock market, however, an investor\nfrequently gets the chance to increase his economic interest in\nbusinesses he knows and likes. Last year we went that direction by\nenlarging our holdings in Coca-Cola and American Express.\n\nOur history with American Express goes way back and, in fact,\nfits the pattern of my pulling current investment decisions out of\npast associations. In 1951, for example, GEICO shares comprised\n70% of my personal portfolio and GEICO was also the first stock I\nsold - I was then 20 - as a security salesman (the sale was 100\nshares to my Aunt Alice who, bless her, would have bought anything\nI suggested). Twenty-five years later, Berkshire purchased a major\nstake in GEICO at the time it was threatened with insolvency. In\nanother instance, that of the Washington Post, about half of my\ninitial investment funds came from delivering the paper in the\n1940's. Three decades later Berkshire purchased a large position\nin the company two years after it went public. As for Coca-Cola,\nmy first business venture - this was in the 1930's - was buying a\nsix-pack of Coke for 25 cents and selling each bottle for 5 cents.\nIt took only fifty years before I finally got it: The real money\nwas in the syrup.\n\nMy American Express history includes a couple of episodes: In\nthe mid-1960's, just after the stock was battered by the company's\ninfamous salad-oil scandal, we put about 40% of Buffett Partnership\nLtd.'s capital into the stock - the largest investment the\npartnership had ever made. I should add that this commitment gave\nus over 5% ownership in Amex at a cost of $13 million. As I write\nthis, we own just under 10%, which has cost us $1.36 billion.\n(Amex earned $12.5 million in 1964 and $1.4 billion in 1994.)\n\nMy history with Amex's IDS unit, which today contributes about\na third of the earnings of the company, goes back even further. I\nfirst purchased stock in IDS in 1953 when it was growing rapidly\nand selling at a price-earnings ratio of only 3. (There was a lot\nof low-hanging fruit in those days.) I even produced a long report\n- do I ever write a short one? - on the company that I sold for $1\nthrough an ad in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nObviously American Express and IDS (recently renamed American\nExpress Financial Advisors) are far different operations today from\nwhat they were then. Nevertheless, I find that a long-term\nfamiliarity with a company and its products is often helpful in\nevaluating it.\n\n",

    "content": "Mistake Du Jour\n\nMistakes occur at the time of decision. We can only make our\nmistake-du-jour award, however, when the foolishness of the\ndecision become obvious. By this measure, 1994 was a vintage year\nwith keen competition for the gold medal. Here, I would like to\ntell you that the mistakes I will describe originated with Charlie.\nBut whenever I try to explain things that way, my nose begins to\ngrow.\n\nAnd the nominees are . . .\n\nLate in 1993 I sold 10 million shares of Cap Cities at $63; at\nyear-end 1994, the price was $85.25. (The difference is $222.5\nmillion for those of you who wish to avoid the pain of calculating\nthe damage yourself.) When we purchased the stock at $17.25 in\n1986, I told you that I had previously sold our Cap Cities holdings\nat $4.30 per share during 1978-80, and added that I was at a loss\nto explain my earlier behavior. Now I've become a repeat offender.\nMaybe it's time to get a guardian appointed.\n\nEgregious as it is, the Cap Cities decision earns only a\nsilver medal. Top honors go to a mistake I made five years ago\nthat fully ripened in 1994: Our $358 million purchase of USAir\npreferred stock, on which the dividend was suspended in September.\nIn the 1990 Annual Report I correctly described this deal as an\n\"unforced error,\" meaning that I was neither pushed into the\ninvestment nor misled by anyone when making it. Rather, this was a\ncase of sloppy analysis, a lapse that may have been caused by the\nfact that we were buying a senior security or by hubris. Whatever\nthe reason, the mistake was large.\n\nBefore this purchase, I simply failed to focus on the problems\nthat would inevitably beset a carrier whose costs were both high\nand extremely difficult to lower. In earlier years, these lifethreatening costs posed few problems. Airlines were then protected\nfrom competition by regulation, and carriers could absorb high\ncosts because they could pass them along by way of fares that were\nalso high.\n\nWhen deregulation came along, it did not immediately change\nthe picture: The capacity of low-cost carriers was so small that\nthe high-cost lines could, in large part, maintain their existing\nfare structures. During this period, with the longer-term problems\nlargely invisible but slowly metastasizing, the costs that were\nnon-sustainable became further embedded.\n\nAs the seat capacity of the low-cost operators expanded, their\nfares began to force the old-line, high-cost airlines to cut their\nown. The day of reckoning for these airlines could be delayed by\ninfusions of capital (such as ours into USAir), but eventually a\nfundamental rule of economics prevailed: In an unregulated\ncommodity business, a company must lower its costs to competitive\nlevels or face extinction. This principle should have been obvious\nto your Chairman, but I missed it.\n\nSeth Schofield, CEO of USAir, has worked diligently to correct\nthe company's historical cost problems but, to date, has not\nmanaged to do so. In part, this is because he has had to deal with\na moving target, the result of certain major carriers having\nobtained labor concessions and other carriers having benefitted\nfrom \"fresh-start\" costs that came out of bankruptcy proceedings.\n(As Herb Kelleher, CEO of Southwest Airlines, has said:\n\"Bankruptcy court for airlines has become a health spa.\")\nAdditionally, it should be no surprise to anyone that those airline\nemployees who contractually receive above-market salaries will\nresist any reduction in these as long as their checks continue to\nclear.\n\nDespite this difficult situation, USAir may yet achieve the\ncost reductions it needs to maintain its viability long-term. But\nit is far from sure that will happen.\n\nAccordingly, we wrote our USAir investment down to $89.5\nmillion, 25 cents on the dollar at yearend 1994. This valuation\nreflects both a possibility that our preferred will have its value\nfully or largely restored and an opposite possibility that the\nstock will eventually become worthless. Whatever the outcome, we\nwill heed a prime rule of investing: You don't have to make it\nback the way that you lost it.\n\nThe accounting effects of our USAir writedown are complicated.\nUnder GAAP accounting, insurance companies are required to carry\nall stocks on their balance sheets at estimated market value.\nTherefore, at the end of last year's third quarter, we were\ncarrying our USAir preferred at $89.5 million, or 25% of cost. In\nother words, our net worth was at that time reflecting a value for\nUSAir that was far below our $358 million cost.\n\nBut in the fourth quarter, we concluded that the decline in\nvalue was, in accounting terms, \"other than temporary,\" and that\njudgment required us to send the writedown of $269 million through\nour income statement. The amount will have no other fourth-quarter\neffect. That is, it will not reduce our net worth, because the\ndiminution of value had already been reflected.\n\nCharlie and I will not stand for reelection to USAir's board\nat the upcoming annual meeting. Should Seth wish to consult with\nus, however, we will be pleased to be of any help that we can.\n\n",

    "content": "Miscellaneous\n\nTwo CEO's who have done great things for Berkshire\nshareholders retired last year: Dan Burke of Capital Cities/ABC\nand Carl Reichardt of Wells Fargo. Dan and Carl encountered very\ntough industry conditions in recent years. But their skill as\nmanagers allowed the businesses they ran to emerge from these\nperiods with record earnings, added luster, and bright prospects.\nAdditionally, Dan and Carl prepared well for their departure and\nleft their companies in outstanding hands. We owe them our\ngratitude.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAbout 95.7% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1994 shareholder-designated contributions program. Contributions\nmade through the program were $10.4 million and 3,300 charities\nwere recipients.\n\nEvery year a few shareholders miss participating in the\nprogram because they either do not have their shares registered in\ntheir own names on the prescribed record date or because they fail\nto get the designation form back to us within the 60-day period\nallowed for its return. Since we don't make exceptions when\nrequirements aren't met, we urge that both new shareholders and old\nread the description of our shareholder-designated contributions\nprogram that appears on pages 50-51.\n\nTo participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so\nregistered on August 31,1995 will be ineligible for the 1995\nprogram.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nWe made only one minor acquisition during 1994 - a small\nretail shoe chain - but our interest in finding good candidates\nremains as keen as ever. The criteria we employ for purchases or\nmergers is detailed in the appendix on page 21.\n\nLast spring, we offered to merge with a large, familycontrolled business on terms that included a Berkshire convertible\npreferred stock. Though we failed to reach an agreement, this\nepisode made me realize that we needed to ask our shareholders to\nauthorize preferred shares in case we wanted in the future to move\nquickly if a similar acquisition opportunity were to appear.\nAccordingly, our proxy presents a proposal that you authorize a\nlarge amount of preferred stock, which will be issuable on terms\nset by the Board of Directors. You can be sure that Charlie and I\nwill not use these shares without being completely satisfied that\nwe are receiving as much in intrinsic value as we are giving.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nCharlie and I hope you can come to the Annual Meeting - at a\nnew site. Last year, we slightly overran the Orpheum Theater's\nseating capacity of 2,750, and therefore we will assemble at 9: 30\na. m. on Monday, May 1,1995, at the Holiday Convention Centre. The\nmain ballroom at the Centre can handle 3,300, and if need be, we\nwill have audio and video equipment in an adjacent room capable of\nhandling another 1,000 people.\n\nLast year we displayed some of Berkshire's products at the\nmeeting, and as a result sold about 800 pounds of candy, 507 pairs\nof shoes, and over $12,000 of World Books and related publications.\nAll these goods will be available again this year. Though we like\nto think of the meeting as a spiritual experience, we must remember\nthat even the least secular of religions includes the ritual of the\ncollection plate.\n\nOf course, what you really should be purchasing is a video\ntape of the 1995 Orange Bowl. Your Chairman views this classic\nnightly, switching to slow motion for the fourth quarter. Our\ncover color this year is a salute to Nebraska's football coach, Tom\nOsborne, and his Cornhuskers, the country's top college team. I\nurge you to wear Husker red to the annual meeting and promise you\nthat at least 50% of your managerial duo will be in appropriate\nattire.\n\nWe recommend that you promptly get hotel reservations for the\nmeeting, as we expect a large crowd. Those of you who like to be\ndowntown (about six miles from the Centre) may wish to stay at the\nRadisson Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms) but nice hotel or at the\nmuch larger Red Lion Hotel a few blocks away. In the vicinity of\nthe Centre are the Holiday Inn (403 rooms), Homewood Suites (118\nrooms) and Hampton Inn (136 rooms). Another recommended spot is\nthe Marriott, whose west Omaha location is about 100 yards from\nBorsheim's and a ten-minute drive from the Centre. There will be\nbuses at the Marriott that will leave at 8: 45 and 9: 00 for the\nmeeting and return after it ends.\n\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. A\ngood-sized parking area is available at the Centre, while those who\nstay at the Holiday Inn, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn will be\nable to walk to the meeting.\n\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to the Nebraska\nFurniture Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you\nfrom there to hotels or the airport later. I hope you make a\nspecial effort to visit the Nebraska Furniture Mart because it has\nopened the Mega Mart, a true retailing marvel that sells\nelectronics, appliances, computers, CD's, cameras and audio\nequipment. Sales have been sensational since the opening, and you\nwill be amazed by both the variety of products available and their\ndisplay on the floor.\n\nThe Mega Mart, adjacent to NFM's main store, is on our 64-acre\nsite about two miles north of the Centre. The stores are open from\n10 a. m. to 9 p. m. on Fridays, 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on Saturdays and\nnoon to 6 p. m. on Sundays. When you're there be sure to say hello\nto Mrs. B, who, at 101, will be hard at work in our Mrs. B's\nWarehouse. She never misses a day at the store - or, for that\nmatter, an hour.\n\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p. m. on Sunday. This\nis always a special day, and we will try to have a few surprises.\nUsually this is the biggest sales day of the year, so for more\nreasons than one Charlie and I hope to see you there.\n\nOn Saturday evening, April 29, there will be a baseball game\nat Rosenblatt Stadium between the Omaha Royals and the Buffalo\nBisons. The Buffalo team is owned by my friends, Mindy and Bob\nRich, Jr., and I'm hoping they will attend. If so, I will try to\nentice Bob into a one-pitch duel on the mound. Bob is a\ncapitalist's Randy Johnson - young, strong and athletic - and not\nthe sort of fellow you want to face early in the season. So I will\nneed plenty of vocal support.\n\nThe proxy statement will include information about obtaining\ntickets to the game. About 1,400 shareholders attended the event\nlast year. Opening the game that night, I had my stuff and threw a\nstrike that the scoreboard reported at eight miles per hour. What\nmany fans missed was that I shook off the catcher's call for my\nfast ball and instead delivered my change-up. This year it will be\nall smoke.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 7,1995 Chairman of the Board",
