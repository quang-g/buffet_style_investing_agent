    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire earned $81.4 billion in 2019 according to generally accepted accounting principles (commonly\ncalled “GAAP”). The components of that figure are $24 billion of operating earnings, $3.7 billion of realized capital\ngains and a $53.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold. Each of those components of earnings is stated on an after-tax basis.\nThat $53.7 billion gain requires comment. It resulted from a new GAAP rule, imposed in 2018, that requires\na company holding equity securities to include in earnings the net change in the unrealized gains and losses of those\nsecurities. As we stated in last year’s letter, neither Charlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, nor I agree\nwith that rule.\nThe adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking.\nBefore 2018, GAAP insisted – with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities – that\nunrealized gains within a portfolio of stocks were never to be included in earnings and unrealized losses were to be\nincluded only if they were deemed “other than temporary.” Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter’s bottom\nline – a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators – every up and down movement of the stocks\nit owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be.\nBerkshire’s 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a down\nyear for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreased by $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP\nearnings of only $4 billion. In 2019, rising stock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7\nbillion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter. Those market gyrations\nled to a crazy 1,900% increase in GAAP earnings!\nMeanwhile, in what we might call the real world, as opposed to accounting-land, Berkshire’s equity holdings\naveraged about $200 billion during the two years, and the intrinsic value of the stocks we own grew steadily and\nsubstantially throughout the period.\nCharlie and I urge you to focus on operating earnings – which were little changed in 2019 – and to ignore\nboth quarterly and annual gains or losses from investments, whether these are realized or unrealized.\nOur advising that in no way diminishes the importance of these investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie\nand I expect our equity holdings – as a group – to deliver major gains, albeit in an unpredictable and highly irregular\nmanner. To see why we are optimistic, move on to the next discussion.",

    "content": "The Power of Retained Earnings\nIn 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long\nTerm Investments, a slim book that changed the investment world. Indeed, writing the book changed Smith himself,\nforcing him to reassess his own investment beliefs.\nGoing in, he planned to argue that stocks would perform better than bonds during inflationary periods and\nthat bonds would deliver superior returns during deflationary times. That seemed sensible enough. But Smith was in\nfor a shock.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nHis book began, therefore, with a confession: “These studies are the record of a failure – the failure of facts\nto sustain a preconceived theory.” Luckily for investors, that failure led Smith to think more deeply about how stocks\nshould be evaluated.\nFor the crux of Smith’s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard\nKeynes: “I have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith’s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point.\nWell-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.\nIn good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is\nan element of compound interest (Keynes’ italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a period\nof years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from the\ndividends paid out to the shareholders.”\nAnd with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.\nIt’s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith’s book was\npublished. After all, it was no secret that mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,\nRockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business earnings to fund growth and produce\never-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich following\nthe same playbook.\nNevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces – “stocks” – buyers in the pre-Smith\nyears usually thought of their shares as a short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks were\nconsidered speculations. Gentlemen preferred bonds.\nThough investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now well\nunderstood. Today, school children learn what Keynes termed “novel”: combining savings with compound interest\nworks wonders.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously. Sometimes this\njob has been easy – at other times, more than difficult, particularly when we began working with huge and evergrowing sums of money.\nIn our deployment of the funds we retain, we first seek to invest in the many and diverse businesses we\nalready own. During the past decade, Berkshire’s depreciation charges have aggregated $65 billion whereas the\ncompany’s internal investments in property, plant and equipment have totaled $121 billion. Reinvestment in\nproductive operational assets will forever remain our top priority.\nIn addition, we constantly seek to buy new businesses that meet three criteria. First, they must earn good\nreturns on the net tangible capital required in their operation. Second, they must be run by able and honest managers.\nFinally, they must be available at a sensible price.\nWhen we spot such businesses, our preference would be to buy 100% of them. But the opportunities to make\nmajor acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare. Far more often, a fickle stock market serves up\nopportunities for us to buy large, but non-controlling, positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.\nWhichever way we go – controlled companies or only a major stake by way of the stock market – Berkshire’s\nfinancial results from the commitment will in large part be determined by the future earnings of the business we have\npurchased. Nonetheless, there is between the two investment approaches a hugely important accounting difference,\nessential for you to understand.",

What you see is what you\nget.\nIn the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, only the dividends that Berkshire\nreceives are recorded in the operating earnings we report. The retained earnings? They’re working hard and creating\nmuch added value, but not in a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire’s reported earnings.\nAt almost all major companies other than Berkshire, investors would not find what we’ll call this “nonrecognition of earnings” important. For us, however, it is a standout omission, of a magnitude that we lay out for you\nbelow.\nHere, we list our 10 largest stock-market holdings of businesses. The list distinguishes between their earnings\nthat are reported to you under GAAP accounting – these are the dividends Berkshire receives from those 10 investees\n• and our share, so to speak, of the earnings the investees retain and put to work. Normally, those companies use\nretained earnings to expand their business and increase its efficiency. Or sometimes they use those funds to repurchase\nsignificant portions of their own stock, an act that enlarges Berkshire’s share of the company’s future earnings.\nBerkshire’s Share (in millions)\nYearend\nCompany Ownership Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 18.7% $ 261 $ 998\nApple 5.7% 773 2,519\nBank of America 10.7% 682 2,167\nBank of New York Mellon 9.0% 101 288\nCoca-Cola 9.3% 640 194\nDelta Airlines 11.0% 114 416\nJ. P. Morgan Chase 1.9% 216 476\nMoody’s 13.1% 55 137\nU. S. Bancorp 9.7% 251 407\nWells Fargo 8.4% 705 730\nTotal $3,798 $8,332\n(1) Based on current annual rate.\n(2) Based on 2019 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.\nObviously, the realized gains we will eventually record from partially owning each of these companies will\nnot neatly correspond to “our” share of their retained earnings. Sometimes, alas, retentions produce nothing. But both\nlogic and our past experience indicate that from the group we will realize capital gains at least equal to – and probably\nbetter than – the earnings of ours that they retained. (When we sell shares and realize gains, we will pay income tax on\nthe gain at whatever rate then prevails. Currently, the federal rate is 21%.)\nIt is certain that Berkshire’s rewards from these 10 companies, as well as those from our many other equity\nholdings, will manifest themselves in a highly irregular manner. Periodically, there will be losses, sometimes\ncompany-specific, sometimes linked to stock-market swoons. At other times – last year was one of those – our gain\nwill be outsized. Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of major importance in the growth of\nBerkshire’s value.\nMr. Smith got it right.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Non-Insurance Operations\nTom Murphy, a valued director of Berkshire and an all-time great among business managers, long ago gave\nme some important advice about acquisitions: “To achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy good\nbusinesses.”\nOver the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as “good\nbusinesses.” Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, on\nthe other hand, have exceeded my hopes.\nIn reviewing my uneven record, I’ve concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course,\nwith a joyful wedding – but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, the\nnew union delivers bliss beyond either party’s hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those images\nto corporate acquisitions, I’d have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It’s easy to get\ndreamy-eyed during corporate courtships.\nPursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happy\nwith the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number,\nhowever, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed.\nFortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by most\nbusinesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the “poor” business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in which\nits operations require an ever-smaller percentage of Berkshire’s capital. Meanwhile, our “good” businesses often tend\nto grow and find opportunities for investing additional capital at attractive rates. Because of these contrasting\ntrajectories, the assets employed at Berkshire’s winners gradually become an expanding portion of our total capital.\nAs an extreme example of those financial movements, witness Berkshire’s original textile business. When\nwe acquired control of the company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly all of Berkshire’s capital.\nFor some time, therefore, Berkshire’s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns. Eventually,\nthough, we acquired a spread of “good” businesses, a shift that by the early 1980 s caused the dwindling textile\noperation to employ only a tiny portion of our capital.\nToday, we have most of your money deployed in controlled businesses that achieve good-to-excellent returns\non the net tangible assets each requires for its operations. Our insurance business has been the superstar. That operation\nhas special characteristics that give it a unique metric for calibrating success, one unfamiliar to many investors. We\nwill save that discussion for the next section.\nIn the paragraphs that follow, we group our wide array of non-insurance businesses by size of earnings, after\ninterest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges – all of those pesky, but very real, costs\nthat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore. Additional information about these operations can be\nfound on pages K-6 – K-21 and pages K-40 – K-52.\nOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) – the two lead dogs of Berkshire’s noninsurance group – earned a combined $8.3 billion in 2019 (including only our 91% share of BHE), an increase of 6%\nfrom 2018.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate earnings in 2019 of\n$4.8 billion, little changed from what these companies earned in 2018.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Johns Manville, Net Jets, Shaw\nand TTI) earned $1.9 billion last year, up from the $1.7 billion earned by this tier in 2018.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Property/Casualty Insurance\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the\nuse of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nFor the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That’s\nbecause the standard investment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily – and properly – skewed toward\nhigh-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates therefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decade\nthe bond market has offered pathetically low rates.\nConsequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced – by maturities or issuer-call provisions –\nto recycle their “old” investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurers\ncould safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less if\ntheir operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never land of negative rates).\nSome insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid\n“alternative” investments promising higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutions\nare ill-equipped to play.\nBerkshire’s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled\nmountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far more\ninvestment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry. The many choices open to us are\nalways advantageous – and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities.\nOur P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 16 of the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2\nbillion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.\nAt Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nAs I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a\nsure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.\nMistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years – even decades – to surface and\nripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur – perhaps\ntomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big One” may come from a traditional source, such as wind or\nearthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything\ninsurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and they\nwill be big – very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our\nresources, and we will be eager to add to our business the next day.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nClose your eyes for a moment and try to envision a locale that might spawn a dynamic P/C insurer. New\nYork? London? Silicon Valley?\nHow about Wilkes-Barre?\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nLate in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he was\nbuying a tiny company – GUARD Insurance Group – in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its net\nworth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD’s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD and\nSy were new names to me.\nBingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and also\ndelivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new products\nand new regions of the country and has increased GUARD’s float by 265%.\nIn 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similar\nsurprise.",

    "content": "Berkshire Hathaway Energy\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20 th year under our ownership. That anniversary suggests\nthat we should be catching up with the company’s accomplishments.\nWe’ll start with the topic of electricity rates. When Berkshire entered the utility business in 2000, purchasing\n76% of BHE, the company’s residential customers in Iowa paid an average of 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (k Wh).\nPrices for residential customers have since risen less than 1% a year, and we have promised that there will be no base\nrate price increases through 2028. In contrast, here’s what is happening at the other large investor-owned Iowa utility:\nLast year, the rates it charged its residential customers were 61% higher than BHE’s. Recently, that utility received a\nrate increase that will widen the gap to 70%.\nThe extraordinary differential between our rates and theirs is largely the result of our huge accomplishments\nin converting wind into electricity. In 2021, we expect BHE’s operation to generate about 25.2 million megawatt-hours\nof electricity (MWh) in Iowa from wind turbines that it both owns and operates. That output will totally cover the\nannual needs of its Iowa customers, which run to about 24.6 million MWh. In other words, our utility will have attained\nwind self-sufficiency in the state of Iowa.\nIn still another contrast, that other Iowa utility generates less than 10% of its power from wind. Furthermore,\nwe know of no other investor-owned utility, wherever located, that by 2021 will have achieved a position of wind\nself-sufficiency. In 2000, BHE was serving an agricultural-based economy; today, three of its five largest customers\nare high-tech giants. I believe their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE’s ability to deliver\nrenewable, low-cost energy.\nOf course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time. In certain periods, when\nthe air is still, we look to our non-wind generating capacity to secure the electricity we need. At opposite times, we\nsell the excess power that wind provides us to other utilities, serving them through what’s called “the grid.” The power\nwe sell them supplants their need for a carbon resource – coal, say, or natural gas.\nBerkshire Hathaway now owns 91% of BHE in partnership with Walter Scott, Jr. and Greg Abel. BHE has\nnever paid Berkshire Hathaway a dividend since our purchase and has, as the years have passed, retained $28 billion\nof earnings. That pattern is an outlier in the world of utilities, whose companies customarily pay big dividends –\nsometimes reaching, or even exceeding, 80% of earnings. Our view: The more we can invest, the more we like it.\nToday, BHE has the operating talent and experience to manage truly huge utility projects – requiring\ninvestments of $100 billion or more – that could support infrastructure benefitting our country, our communities and\nour shareholders. We stand ready, willing and able to take on such opportunities.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

In blunt words, the paper asked for biographical data it planned to use in Joe’s obituary. Joe\ndidn’t respond. So? A month later, he got a second letter from the paper, this one labeled “URGENT.”\nCharlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone. That’s not exactly great news for us. But Berkshire\nshareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.\nThe two of us base our optimism upon five factors. First, Berkshire’s assets are deployed in an extraordinary\nvariety of wholly or partly-owned businesses that, averaged out, earn attractive returns on the capital they use. Second,\nBerkshire’s positioning of its “controlled” businesses within a single entity endows it with some important and\nenduring economic advantages. Third, Berkshire’s financial affairs will unfailingly be managed in a manner allowing\nthe company to withstand external shocks of an extreme nature. Fourth, we possess skilled and devoted top managers\nfor whom running Berkshire is far more than simply having a high-paying and/or prestigious job. Finally, Berkshire’s\ndirectors – your guardians – are constantly focused on both the welfare of owners and the nurturing of a culture that\nis rare among giant corporations. (The value of this culture is explored in Margin of Trust, a new book by Larry\nCunningham and Stephanie Cuba that will be available at our annual meeting.)\nCharlie and I have very pragmatic reasons for wanting to assure Berkshire’s prosperity in the years following\nour exit: The Mungers have Berkshire holdings that dwarf any of the family’s other investments, and I have a full 99%\nof my net worth lodged in Berkshire stock. I have never sold any shares and have no plans to do so. My only disposal\nof Berkshire shares, aside from charitable donations and minor personal gifts, took place in 1980, when I, along with\nother Berkshire stockholders who elected to participate, exchanged some of our Berkshire shares for the shares of an\nIllinois bank that Berkshire had purchased in 1969 and that, in 1980, needed to be offloaded because of changes in the\nbank holding company law.\nToday, my will specifically directs its executors – as well as the trustees who will succeed them in\nadministering my estate after the will is closed – not to sell any Berkshire shares. My will also absolves both the\nexecutors and the trustees from liability for maintaining what obviously will be an extreme concentration of assets.\nThe will goes on to instruct the executors – and, in time, the trustees – to each year convert a portion of my\nA shares into B shares and then distribute the Bs to various foundations. Those foundations will be required to deploy\ntheir grants promptly. In all, I estimate that it will take 12 to 15 years for the entirety of the Berkshire shares I hold at\nmy death to move into the market.\nAbsent my will’s directive that all my Berkshire shares should be held until their scheduled distribution dates,\nthe “safe” course for both my executors and trustees would be to sell the Berkshire shares under their temporary\ncontrol and reinvest the proceeds in U. S. Treasury bonds with maturities matching the scheduled dates for\ndistributions. That strategy would leave the fiduciaries immune from both public criticism and the possibility of\npersonal liability for failure to act in accordance with the “prudent man” standard.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nI myself feel comfortable that Berkshire shares will provide a safe and rewarding investment during the\ndisposal period. There is always a chance – unlikely, but not negligible – that events will prove me wrong. I believe,\nhowever, that there is a high probability that my directive will deliver substantially greater resources to society than\nwould result from a conventional course of action.\nKey to my “Berkshire-only” instructions is my faith in the future judgment and fidelity of Berkshire directors.\nThey will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees. At many companies, these super-salesmen might win. I\ndo not, however, expect that to happen at Berkshire.",

Consequently,\ncompensation arrangements have become more complicated – what committee member wants to explain paying large\nfees year after year for a simple plan? – and the reading of proxy material has become a mind-numbing experience.\nOne very important improvement in corporate governance has been mandated: a regularly-scheduled\n“executive session” of directors at which the CEO is barred. Prior to that change, truly frank discussions of a CEO’s\nskills, acquisition decisions and compensation were rare.\nAcquisition proposals remain a particularly vexing problem for board members.

    "content": "Boards of Directors\n\nOverall, the deck is stacked in favor of the deal that’s coveted by the CEO and his/her obliging staff. It would\nbe an interesting exercise for a company to hire two “expert” acquisition advisors, one pro and one con, to deliver his\nor her views on a proposed deal to the board – with the winning advisor to receive, say, ten times a token sum paid to\nthe loser. Don’t hold your breath awaiting this reform: The current system, whatever its shortcomings for shareholders,\nworks magnificently for CEOs and the many advisors and other professionals who feast on deals. A venerable caution\nwill forever be true when advice from Wall Street is contemplated: Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.\nOver the years, board “independence” has become a new area of emphasis. One key point relating to this\ntopic, though, is almost invariably overlooked: Director compensation has now soared to a level that inevitably makes\npay a subconscious factor affecting the behavior of many non-wealthy members. Think, for a moment, of the director\nearning $250,000-300,000 for board meetings consuming a pleasant couple of days six or so times a year. Frequently,\nthe possession of one such directorship bestows on its holder three to four times the annual median income of U. S.\nhouseholds. (I missed much of this gravy train: As a director of Portland Gas Light in the early 1960 s, I received $100\nannually for my service. To earn this princely sum, I commuted to Maine four times a year.)\nAnd job security now? It’s fabulous. Board members may get politely ignored, but they seldom get fired.\nInstead, generous age limits – usually 70 or higher – act as the standard method for the genteel ejection of directors.\nIs it any wonder that a non-wealthy director (“NWD”) now hopes – or even yearns – to be asked to join a\nsecond board, thereby vaulting into the $500,000-600,000 class? To achieve this goal, the NWD will need help. The\nCEO of a company searching for board members will almost certainly check with the NWD’s current CEO as to\nwhether NWD is a “good” director. “Good,” of course, is a code word. If the NWD has seriously challenged his/her\npresent CEO’s compensation or acquisition dreams, his or her candidacy will silently die. When seeking directors,\nCEOs don’t look for pit bulls. It’s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.\nDespite the illogic of it all, the director for whom fees are important – indeed, craved – is almost universally\nclassified as “independent” while many directors possessing fortunes very substantially linked to the welfare of the\ncorporation are deemed lacking in independence. Not long ago, I looked at the proxy material of a large American\ncompany and found that eight directors had never purchased a share of the company’s stock using their own money.\n(They, of course, had received grants of stock as a supplement to their generous cash compensation.) This particular\ncompany had long been a laggard, but the directors were doing wonderfully.\nPaid-with-my-own-money ownership, of course, does not create wisdom or ensure business smarts.\nNevertheless, I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shares\nwith their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nHere, a pause is due: I’d like you to know that almost all of the directors I have met over the years have been\ndecent, likable and intelligent. They dressed well, made good neighbors and were fine citizens. I’ve enjoyed their\ncompany. Among the group are some men and women that I would not have met except for our mutual board service\nand who have become close friends.\nNevertheless, many of these good souls are people whom I would never have chosen to handle money or\nbusiness matters. It simply was not their game.\nThey, in turn, would never have asked me for help in removing a tooth, decorating their home or improving\ntheir golf swing. Moreover, if I were ever scheduled to appear on Dancing With the Stars, I would immediately seek\nrefuge in the Witness Protection Program. We are all duds at one thing or another. For most of us, the list is long. The\nimportant point to recognize is that if you are Bobby Fischer, you must play only chess for money.\nAt Berkshire, we will continue to look for business-savvy directors who are owner-oriented and arrive with\na strong specific interest in our company. Thought and principles, not robot-like “process,” will guide their actions.\nIn representing your interests, they will, of course, seek managers whose goals include delighting their customers,\ncherishing their associates and acting as good citizens of both their communities and our country.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nThose objectives are not new. They were the goals of able CEOs sixty years ago and remain so. Who would\nhave it otherwise?",
