    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1984 was $152.6 million, or\n$133 per share. This sounds pretty good but actually its\nmediocre. Economic gains must be evaluated by comparison with\nthe capital that produces them. Our twenty-year compounded\nannual gain in book value has been 22.1% (from $19.46 in 1964 to\n$1108.77 in 1984), but our gain in 1984 was only 13.6%.\n\nAs we discussed last year, the gain in per-share intrinsic\nbusiness value is the economic measurement that really counts.\nBut calculations of intrinsic business value are subjective. In\nour case, book value serves as a useful, although somewhat\nunderstated, proxy. In my judgment, intrinsic business value and\nbook value increased during 1984 at about the same rate.\n\nUsing my academic voice, I have told you in the past of the\ndrag that a mushrooming capital base exerts upon rates of return.\nUnfortunately, my academic voice is now giving way to a\nreportorial voice. Our historical 22% rate is just that -\nhistory. To earn even 15% annually over the next decade\n(assuming we continue to follow our present dividend policy,\nabout which more will be said later in this letter) we would need\nprofits aggregating about $3.9 billion. Accomplishing this will\nrequire a few big ideas - small ones just wont do. Charlie\nMunger, my partner in general management, and I do not have any\nsuch ideas at present, but our experience has been that they pop\nup occasionally. (Hows that for a strategic plan?)\n",

    "content": "Sources of Reported Earnings\n\n\n\nSharp-eyed shareholders will notice that the amount of the\nspecial GEICO distribution and its location in the table have\nbeen changed from the presentation of last year. Though they\nreclassify and reduce accounting earnings, the changes are\nentirely of form, not of substance. The story behind the\nchanges, however, is interesting.\n\nAs reported last year: (1) in mid-1983 GEICO made a tender\noffer to buy its own shares; (2) at the same time, we agreed by\nwritten contract to sell GEICO an amount of its shares that would\nbe proportionately related to the aggregate number of shares\nGEICO repurchased via the tender from all other shareholders; (3)\nat completion of the tender, we delivered 350,000 shares to\nGEICO, received $21 million cash, and were left owning exactly\nthe same percentage of GEICO that we owned before the tender; (4)\nGEICOs transaction with us amounted to a proportionate\nredemption, an opinion rendered us, without qualification, by a\nleading law firm; (5) the Tax Code logically regards such\nproportionate redemptions as substantially equivalent to\ndividends and, therefore, the $21 million we received was taxed\nat only the 6.9% inter-corporate dividend rate; (6) importantly,\nthat $21 million was far less than the previously-undistributed\nearnings that had inured to our ownership in GEICO and, thus,\nfrom the standpoint of economic substance, was in our view\nequivalent to a dividend.\n\nBecause it was material and unusual, we highlighted the\nGEICO distribution last year to you, both in the applicable\nquarterly report and in this section of the annual report.\nAdditionally, we emphasized the transaction to our auditors,\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. Both the Omaha office of Peat\nMarwick and the reviewing Chicago partner, without objection,\nconcurred with our dividend presentation.\n\nIn 1984, we had a virtually identical transaction with\nGeneral Foods. The only difference was that General Foods\nrepurchased its stock over a period of time in the open market,\nwhereas GEICO had made a one-shot tender offer. In the General\nFoods case we sold to the company, on each day that it\nrepurchased shares, a quantity of shares that left our ownership\npercentage precisely unchanged. Again our transaction was\npursuant to a written contract executed before repurchases began.\nAnd again the money we received was far less than the retained\nearnings that had inured to our ownership interest since our\npurchase. Overall we received $21,843,601 in cash from General\nFoods, and our ownership remained at exactly 8.75%.\n\nAt this point the New York office of Peat Marwick came into\nthe picture. Late in 1984 it indicated that it disagreed with\nthe conclusions of the firms Omaha office and Chicago reviewing\npartner. The New York view was that the GEICO and General Foods\ntransactions should be treated as sales of stock by Berkshire\nrather than as the receipt of dividends. Under this accounting\napproach, a portion of the cost of our investment in the stock of\neach company would be charged against the redemption payment and\nany gain would be shown as a capital gain, not as dividend\nincome. This is an accounting approach only, having no bearing\non taxes: Peat Marwick agrees that the transactions were\ndividends for IRS purposes.\n\nWe disagree with the New York position from both the\nviewpoint of economic substance and proper accounting. But, to\navoid a qualified auditors opinion, we have adopted herein Peat\nMarwicks 1984 view and restated 1983 accordingly. None of this,\nhowever, has any effect on intrinsic business value: our\nownership interests in GEICO and General Foods, our cash, our\ntaxes, and the market value and tax basis of our holdings all\nremain the same.\n\nThis year we have again entered into a contract with General\nFoods whereby we will sell them shares concurrently with open\nmarket purchases that they make. The arrangement provides that\nour ownership interest will remain unchanged at all times. By\nkeeping it so, we will insure ourselves dividend treatment for\ntax purposes. In our view also, the economic substance of this\ntransaction again is the creation of dividend income. However,\nwe will account for the redemptions as sales of stock rather than\ndividend income unless accounting rules are adopted that speak\ndirectly to this point. We will continue to prominently identify\nany such special transactions in our reports to you.\n\nWhile we enjoy a low tax charge on these proportionate\nredemptions, and have participated in several of them, we view\nsuch repurchases as at least equally favorable for shareholders\nwho do not sell. When companies with outstanding businesses and\ncomfortable financial positions find their shares selling far\nbelow intrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action\ncan benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases.\n\n(Our endorsement of repurchases is limited to those dictated\nby price/value relationships and does not extend to the\ngreenmail repurchase - a practice we find odious and repugnant.\nIn these transactions, two parties achieve their personal ends by\nexploitation of an innocent and unconsulted third party. The\nplayers are: (1) the shareholder extortionist who, even before\nthe ink on his stock certificate dries, delivers his yourmoney-or-your-life message to managers; (2) the corporate\ninsiders who quickly seek peace at any price - as long as the\nprice is paid by someone else; and (3) the shareholders whose\nmoney is used by (2) to make (1) go away. As the dust settles,\nthe mugging, transient shareholder gives his speech on free\nenterprise, the muggee management gives its speech on the best\ninterests of the company, and the innocent shareholder standing\nby mutely funds the payoff.)\n\nThe companies in which we have our largest investments have\nall engaged in significant stock repurhases at times when wide\ndiscrepancies existed between price and value. As shareholders,\nwe find this encouraging and rewarding for two important reasons\n- one that is obvious, and one that is subtle and not always\nunderstood. The obvious point involves basic arithmetic: major\nrepurchases at prices well below per-share intrinsic business\nvalue immediately increase, in a highly significant way, that\nvalue. When companies purchase their own stock, they often find\nit easy to get $2 of present value for $1. Corporate acquisition\nprograms almost never do as well and, in a discouragingly large\nnumber of cases, fail to get anything close to $1 of value for\neach $1 expended.",

By making\nrepurchases when a companys market value is well below its\nbusiness value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given\nto actions that enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than\nto actions that expand managements domain but that do nothing\nfor (or even harm) shareholders. Seeing this, shareholders and\npotential shareholders increase their estimates of future returns\nfrom the business. This upward revision, in turn, produces\nmarket prices more in line with intrinsic business value. These\nprices are entirely rational. Investors should pay more for a\nbusiness that is lodged in the hands of a manager with\ndemonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands\nof a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer. (To\nmake the point extreme, how much would you pay to be a minority\nshareholder of a company controlled by Robert Wesco?)\n\nThe key word is demonstrated. A manager who consistently\nturns his back on repurchases, when these clearly are in the\ninterests of owners, reveals more than he knows of his\nmotivations. No matter how often or how eloquently he mouths\nsome public relations-inspired phrase such as maximizing\nshareholder wealth (this seasons favorite), the market\ncorrectly discounts assets lodged with him. His heart is not\nlistening to his mouth - and, after a while, neither will the\nmarket.\n\nWe have prospered in a very major way - as have other\nshareholders - by the large share repurchases of GEICO,\nWashington Post, and General Foods, our three largest holdings.\n(Exxon, in which we have our fourth largest holding, has also\nwisely and aggressively repurchased shares but, in this case, we\nhave only recently established our position.) In each of these\ncompanies, shareholders have had their interests in outstanding\nbusinesses materially enhanced by repurchases made at bargain\nprices. We feel very comfortable owning interests in businesses\nsuch as these that offer excellent economics combined with\nshareholder-conscious managements.",

    "content": "\nNebraska Furniture Mart\n\nLast year I introduced you to Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin) and her\nfamily. I told you they were terrific, and I understated the\ncase. After another year of observing their remarkable talents\nand character, I can honestly say that I never have seen a\nmanagerial group that either functions or behaves better than the\nBlumkin family.\n\nMrs. B, Chairman of the Board, is now 91, and recently was\nquoted in the local newspaper as saying, I come home to eat and\nsleep, and thats about it. I cant wait until it gets daylight\nso I can get back to the business. Mrs. B is at the store seven\ndays a week, from opening to close, and probably makes more\ndecisions in a day than most CEOs do in a year (better ones,\ntoo).\n\nIn May Mrs. B was granted an Honorary Doctorate in\nCommercial Science by New York University. (Shes a fast track\nstudent: not one day in her life was spent in a school room prior\nto her receipt of the doctorate.) Previous recipients of honorary\ndegrees in business from NYU include Clifton Garvin, Jr., CEO of\nExxon Corp.; Walter Wriston, then CEO of Citicorp; Frank Cary,\nthen CEO of IBM; Tom Murphy, then CEO of General Motors; and,\nmost recently, Paul Volcker. (They are in good company.)\n\nThe Blumkin blood did not run thin. Louie, Mrs. Bs son,\nand his three boys, Ron, Irv, and Steve, all contribute in full\nmeasure to NFMs amazing success. The younger generation has\nattended the best business school of them all - that conducted by\nMrs. B and Louie - and their training is evident in their\nperformance.\n\nLast year NFMs net sales increased by $14.3 million,\nbringing the total to $115 million, all from the one store in\nOmaha. That is by far the largest volume produced by a single\nhome furnishings store in the United States. In fact, the gain\nin sales last year was itself greater than the annual volume of\nmany good-sized successful stores. The business achieves this\nsuccess because it deserves this success. A few figures will\ntell you why.\n\nIn its fiscal 1984 10-K, the largest independent specialty\nretailer of home furnishings in the country, Levitz Furniture,\ndescribed its prices as generally lower than the prices charged\nby conventional furniture stores in its trading area. Levitz,\nin that year, operated at a gross margin of 44.4% (that is, on\naverage, customers paid it $100 for merchandise that had cost it\n$55.60 to buy). The gross margin at NFM is not much more than\nhalf of that. NFMs low mark-ups are possible because of its\nexceptional efficiency: operating expenses (payroll, occupancy,\nadvertising, etc.) are about 16.5% of sales versus 35.6% at\nLevitz.\n\nNone of this is in criticism of Levitz, which has a wellmanaged operation. But the NFM operation is simply extraordinary\n(and, remember, it all comes from a $500 investment by Mrs. B in\n1937). By unparalleled efficiency and astute volume purchasing,\nNFM is able to earn excellent returns on capital while saving its\ncustomers at least $30 million annually from what, on average, it\nwould cost them to buy the same merchandise at stores maintaining\ntypical mark-ups. Such savings enable NFM to constantly widen\nits geographical reach and thus to enjoy growth well beyond the\nnatural growth of the Omaha market.\n\nI have been asked by a number of people just what secrets\nthe Blumkins bring to their business. These are not very\nesoteric. All members of the family: (1) apply themselves with\nan enthusiasm and energy that would make Ben Franklin and Horatio\nAlger look like dropouts; (2) define with extraordinary realism\ntheir area of special competence and act decisively on all\nmatters within it; (3) ignore even the most enticing propositions\nfailing outside of that area of special competence; and, (4)\nunfailingly behave in a high-grade manner with everyone they deal\nwith. (Mrs. B boils it down to sell cheap and tell the truth.)\n\nOur evaluation of the integrity of Mrs. B and her family was\ndemonstrated when we purchased 90% of the business: NFM had never\nhad an audit and we did not request one; we did not take an\ninventory nor verify the receivables; we did not check property\ntitles. We gave Mrs. B a check for $55 million and she gave us\nher word. That made for an even exchange.\n\nYou and I are fortunate to be in partnership with the\nBlumkin family.\n",

To the contrary, many well-known participants in the\nboxed-chocolate industry either have lost money in this same\nperiod or have been marginally profitable. To our knowledge,\nonly one good-sized competitor has achieved high profitability.\nThe success of Sees reflects the combination of an exceptional\nproduct and an exceptional manager, Chuck Huggins.\n\nDuring 1984 we increased prices considerably less than has\nbeen our practice in recent years: per-pound realization was\n$5.49, up only 1.4% from 1983. Fortunately, we made good\nprogress on cost control, an area that has caused us problems in\nrecent years. Per-pound costs - other than those for raw\nmaterials, a segment of expense largely outside of our control -\nincreased by only 2.2% last year.\n\nOur cost-control problem has been exacerbated by the problem\nof modestly declining volume (measured by pounds, not dollars) on\na same-store basis. Total pounds sold through shops in recent\nyears has been maintained at a roughly constant level only by the\nnet addition of a few shops annually. This more-shops-to-getthe-same-volume situation naturally puts heavy pressure on perpound selling costs.\n\nIn 1984, same-store volume declined 1.1%. Total shop volume,\nhowever, grew 0.6% because of an increase in stores. (Both\npercentages are adjusted to compensate for a 53-week fiscal year\nin 1983.)\n\nSees business tends to get a bit more seasonal each year.\nIn the four weeks prior to Christmas, we do 40% of the years\nvolume and earn about 75% of the years profits. We also earn\nsignificant sums in the Easter and Valentines Day periods, but\npretty much tread water the rest of the year. In recent years,\nshop volume at Christmas has grown in relative importance, and so\nhave quantity orders and mail orders. The increased\nconcentration of business in the Christmas period produces a\nmultitude of managerial problems, all of which have been handled\nby Chuck and his associates with exceptional skill and grace.\n\nTheir solutions have in no way involved compromises in\neither quality of service or quality of product. Most of our\nlarger competitors could not say the same. Though faced with\nsomewhat less extreme peaks and valleys in demand than we, they\nadd preservatives or freeze the finished product in order to\nsmooth the production cycle and thereby lower unit costs. We\nreject such techniques, opting, in effect, for production\nheadaches rather than product modification.\n\nOur mall stores face a host of new food and snack vendors\nthat provide particularly strong competition at non-holiday\nperiods. We need new products to fight back and during 1984 we\nintroduced six candy bars that, overall, met with a good\nreception. Further product introductions are planned.\n\nIn 1985 we will intensify our efforts to keep per-pound cost\nincreases below the rate of inflation. Continued success in\nthese efforts, however, will require gains in same-store\npoundage. Prices in 1985 should average 6% - 7% above those of\n1984. Assuming no change in same-store volume, profits should\nshow a moderate gain.\n",

    "content": "\nBuffalo Evening News\n\nProfits at the News in 1984 were considerably greater than\nwe expected. As at Sees, excellent progress was made in\ncontrolling costs. Excluding hours worked in the newsroom, total\nhours worked decreased by about 2.8%. With this productivity\nimprovement, overall costs increased only 4.9%. This performance\nby Stan Lipsey and his management team was one of the best in the\nindustry.\n\nHowever, we now face an acceleration in costs. In mid-1984\nwe entered into new multi-year union contracts that provided for\na large catch-up wage increase. This catch-up is entirely\nappropriate: the cooperative spirit of our unions during the\nunprofitable 1977-1982 period was an important factor in our\nsuccess in remaining cost competitive with The Courier-Express.\nHad we not kept costs down, the outcome of that struggle might\nwell have been different.\n\nBecause our new union contracts took effect at varying\ndates, little of the catch-up increase was reflected in our 1984\ncosts. But the increase will be almost totally effective in 1985\nand, therefore, our unit labor costs will rise this year at a\nrate considerably greater than that of the industry. We expect\nto mitigate this increase by continued small gains in\nproductivity, but we cannot avoid significantly higher wage costs\nthis year. Newsprint price trends also are less favorable now\nthan they were in 1984. Primarily because of these two factors,\nwe expect at least a minor contraction in margins at the News.\n\nWorking in our favor at the News are two factors of major\neconomic importance:\n\n(1) Our circulation is concentrated to an unusual degree\nin the area of maximum utility to our advertisers.\nRegional newspapers with wide-ranging circulation, on\nthe other hand, have a significant portion of their\ncirculation in areas that are of negligible utility to\nmost advertisers. A subscriber several hundred miles\naway is not much of a prospect for the puppy you are\noffering to sell via a classified ad - nor for the\ngrocer with stores only in the metropolitan area.\nWasted circulation - as the advertisers call it -\nhurts profitability: expenses of a newspaper are\ndetermined largely by gross circulation while\nadvertising revenues (usually 70% - 80% of total\nrevenues) are responsive only to useful circulation;\n\n(2) Our penetration of the Buffalo retail market is\nexceptional; advertisers can reach almost all of their\npotential customers using only the News.\n\nLast year I told you about this unusual reader acceptance:\namong the 100 largest newspapers in the country, we were then\nnumber one, daily, and number three, Sunday, in penetration. The\nmost recent figures show us number one in penetration on weekdays\nand number two on Sunday. (Even so, the number of households in\nBuffalo has declined, so our current weekday circulation is down\nslightly; on Sundays it is unchanged.)\n\nI told you also that one of the major reasons for this\nunusual acceptance by readers was the unusual quantity of news\nthat we delivered to them: a greater percentage of our paper is\ndevoted to news than is the case at any other dominant paper in\nour size range. In 1984 our news hole ratio was 50.9%, (versus\n50.4% in 1983), a level far above the typical 35% - 40%. We will\ncontinue to maintain this ratio in the 50% area. Also, though we\nlast year reduced total hours worked in other departments, we\nmaintained the level of employment in the newsroom and, again,\nwill continue to do so. Newsroom costs advanced 9.1% in 1984, a\nrise far exceeding our overall cost increase of 4.9%.\n\nOur news hole policy costs us significant extra money for\nnewsprint. As a result, our news costs (newsprint for the news\nhole plus payroll and expenses of the newsroom) as a percentage\nof revenue run higher than those of most dominant papers of our\nsize. There is adequate room, however, for our paper or any\nother dominant paper to sustain these costs: the difference\nbetween high and low news costs at papers of comparable size\nruns perhaps three percentage points while pre-tax profit margins\nare often ten times that amount.\n\nThe economics of a dominant newspaper are excellent, among\nthe very best in the business world. Owners, naturally, would\nlike to believe that their wonderful profitability is achieved\nonly because they unfailingly turn out a wonderful product. That\ncomfortable theory wilts before an uncomfortable fact. While\nfirst-class newspapers make excellent profits, the profits of\nthird-rate papers are as good or better - as long as either class\nof paper is dominant within its community. Of course, product\nquality may have been crucial to the paper in achieving\ndominance. We believe this was the case at the News, in very\nlarge part because of people such as Alfred Kirchhofer who\npreceded us.\n\nOnce dominant, the newspaper itself, not the marketplace,\ndetermines just how good or how bad the paper will be. Good or\nbad, it will prosper. That is not true of most businesses:\ninferior quality generally produces inferior economics. But even\na poor newspaper is a bargain to most citizens simply because of\nits bulletin board value. Other things being equal, a poor\nproduct will not achieve quite the level of readership achieved\nby a first-class product. A poor product, however, will still\nremain essential to most citizens, and what commands their\nattention will command the attention of advertisers.\n\nSince high standards are not imposed by the marketplace,\nmanagement must impose its own. Our commitment to an aboveaverage expenditure for news represents an important quantitative\nstandard. We have confidence that Stan Lipsey and Murray Light\nwill continue to apply the far-more important qualitative\nstandards. Charlie and I believe that newspapers are very\nspecial institutions in society. We are proud of the News, and\nintend an even greater pride to be justified in the years ahead.\n",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\n\n\nBests data reflect the experience of practically the entire\nindustry, including stock, mutual, and reciprocal companies. The\ncombined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses incurred\nplus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums; a ratio below\n100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above 100 indicates\na loss.\n\nFor a number of years, we have told you that an annual\nincrease by the industry of about 10% per year in premiums\nwritten is necessary for the combined ratio to remain roughly\nunchanged. We assumed in making that assertion that expenses as\na percentage of premium volume would stay relatively stable and\nthat losses would grow at about 10% annually because of the\ncombined influence of unit volume increases, inflation, and\njudicial rulings that expand what is covered by the insurance\npolicy.\n\nOur opinion is proving dismayingly accurate: a premium\nincrease of 10% per year since 1979 would have produced an\naggregate increase through 1984 of 61% and a combined ratio in\n1984 almost identical to the 100.6 of 1979. Instead, the\nindustry had only a 30% increase in premiums and a 1984 combined\nratio of 117.7. Today, we continue to believe that the key index\nto the trend of underwriting profitability is the year-to-year\npercentage change in industry premium volume.\n\nIt now appears that premium volume in 1985 will grow well\nover 10%. Therefore, assuming that catastrophes are at a\nnormal level, we would expect the combined ratio to begin\neasing downward toward the end of the year. However, under our\nindustrywide loss assumptions (i. e., increases of 10% annually),\nfive years of 15%-per-year increases in premiums would be\nrequired to get the combined ratio back to 100. This would mean\na doubling of industry volume by 1989, an outcome that seems\nhighly unlikely to us. Instead, we expect several years of\npremium gains somewhat above the 10% level, followed by highlycompetitive pricing that generally will produce combined ratios\nin the 108-113 range.\n\nOur own combined ratio in 1984 was a humbling 134. (Here, as\nthroughout this report, we exclude structured settlements and the\nassumption of loss reserves in reporting this ratio. Much\nadditional detail, including the effect of discontinued\noperations on the ratio, appears on pages 42-43). This is the\nthird year in a row that our underwriting performance has been\nfar poorer than that of the industry. We expect an improvement\nin the combined ratio in 1985, and also expect our improvement to\nbe substantially greater than that of the industry. Mike\nGoldberg has corrected many of the mistakes I made before he took\nover insurance operations. Moreover, our business is\nconcentrated in lines that have experienced poorer-than-average\nresults during the past several years, and that circumstance has\nbegun to subdue many of our competitors and even eliminate some.\nWith the competition shaken, we were able during the last half of\n1984 to raise prices significantly in certain important lines\nwith little loss of business.\n\nFor some years I have told you that there could be a day\ncoming when our premier financial strength would make a real\ndifference in the competitive position of our insurance\noperation. That day may have arrived. We are almost without\nquestion the strongest property/casualty insurance operation in\nthe country, with a capital position far superior to that of\nwell-known companies of much greater size.\n\nEqually important, our corporate policy is to retain that\nsuperiority. The buyer of insurance receives only a promise in\nexchange for his cash. The value of that promise should be\nappraised against the possibility of adversity, not prosperity.\nAt a minimum, the promise should appear able to withstand a\nprolonged combination of depressed financial markets and\nexceptionally unfavorable underwriting results. Our insurance\nsubsidiaries are both willing and able to keep their promises in\nany such environment - and not too many other companies clearly\nare.\n\nOur financial strength is a particular asset in the business\nof structured settlements and loss reserve assumptions that we\nreported on last year. The claimant in a structured settlement\nand the insurance company that has reinsured loss reserves need\nto be completely confident that payments will be forthcoming for\ndecades to come. Very few companies in the property/casualty\nfield can meet this test of unquestioned long-term strength. (In\nfact, only a handful of companies exists with which we will\nreinsure our own liabilities.)\n\nWe have grown in these new lines of business: funds that we\nhold to offset assumed liabilities grew from $16.2 million to\n$30.6 million during the year. We expect growth to continue and\nperhaps to greatly accelerate. To support this projected growth\nwe have added substantially to the capital of Columbia Insurance\nCompany, our reinsurance unit specializing in structured\nsettlements and loss reserve assumptions. While these businesses\nare very competitive, returns should be satisfactory.\n\nAt GEICO the news, as usual, is mostly good. That company\nachieved excellent unit growth in its primary insurance business\nduring 1984, and the performance of its investment portfolio\ncontinued to be extraordinary. Though underwriting results\ndeteriorated late in the year, they still remain far better than\nthose of the industry. Our ownership in GEICO at yearend\namounted to 36% and thus our interest in their direct\nproperty/casualty volume of $885 million amounted to $320\nmillion, or well over double our own premium volume.",

I warned you that over performance by\nthe stock relative to the performance of the business obviously\ncould not occur every year, and that in some years the stock must\nunder perform the business. In 1984 that occurred and the\ncarrying value of our interest in GEICO changed hardly at all,\nwhile the intrinsic business value of that interest increased\nsubstantially. Since 27% of Berkshires net worth at the\nbeginning of 1984 was represented by GEICO, its static market\nvalue had a significant impact upon our rate of gain for the\nyear. We are not at all unhappy with such a result: we would far\nrather have the business value of GEICO increase by X during the\nyear, while market value decreases, than have the intrinsic value\nincrease by only 1/2 X with market value soaring. In GEICOs\ncase, as in all of our investments, we look to business\nperformance, not market performance. If we are correct in\nexpectations regarding the business, the market eventually will\nfollow along.\n\nYou, as shareholders of Berkshire, have benefited in\nenormous measure from the talents of GEICOs Jack Byrne, Bill\nSnyder, and Lou Simpson. In its core business - low-cost auto\nand homeowners insurance - GEICO has a major, sustainable\ncompetitive advantage. That is a rare asset in business\ngenerally, and its almost non-existent in the field of financial\nservices. (GEICO, itself, illustrates this point: despite the\ncompanys excellent management, superior profitability has eluded\nGEICO in all endeavors other than its core business.) In a large\nindustry, a competitive advantage such as GEICOs provides the\npotential for unusual economic rewards, and Jack and Bill\ncontinue to exhibit great skill in realizing that potential.\n\nMost of the funds generated by GEICOs core insurance\noperation are made available to Lou for investment. Lou has the\nrare combination of temperamental and intellectual\ncharacteristics that produce outstanding long-term investment\nperformance. Operating with below-average risk, he has generated\nreturns that have been by far the best in the insurance industry.\nI applaud and appreciate the efforts and talents of these three\noutstanding managers.\n",

    "content": "\nErrors in Loss Reserving\n\nAny shareholder in a company with important interests in the\nproperty/casualty insurance business should have some\nunderstanding of the weaknesses inherent in the reporting of\ncurrent earnings in that industry. Phil Graham, when publisher\nof the Washington Post, described the daily newspaper as a first\nrough draft of history. Unfortunately, the financial statements\nof a property/casualty insurer provide, at best, only a first\nrough draft of earnings and financial condition.\n\nThe determination of costs is the main problem. Most of an\ninsurers costs result from losses on claims, and many of the\nlosses that should be charged against the current years revenue\nare exceptionally difficult to estimate. Sometimes the extent of\nthese losses, or even their existence, is not known for decades.\n\nThe loss expense charged in a property/casualty companys\ncurrent income statement represents: (1) losses that occurred and\nwere paid during the year; (2) estimates for losses that occurred\nand were reported to the insurer during the year, but which have\nyet to be settled; (3) estimates of ultimate dollar costs for\nlosses that occurred during the year but of which the insurer is\nunaware (termed IBNR: incurred but not reported); and (4) the\nnet effect of revisions this year of similar estimates for (2)\nand (3) made in past years.\n\nSuch revisions may be long delayed, but eventually any\nestimate of losses that causes the income for year X to be\nmisstated must be corrected, whether it is in year X + 1, or\nX + 10. This, perforce, means that earnings in the year of\ncorrection also are misstated. For example, assume a claimant\nwas injured by one of our insureds in 1979 and we thought a\nsettlement was likely to be made for $10,000. That year we would\nhave charged $10,000 to our earnings statement for the estimated\ncost of the loss and, correspondingly, set up a liability reserve\non the balance sheet for that amount. If we settled the claim in\n1984 for $100,000, we would charge earnings with a loss cost of\n$90,000 in 1984, although that cost was truly an expense of 1979.\nAnd if that piece of business was our only activity in 1979, we\nwould have badly misled ourselves as to costs, and you as to\nearnings.\n\nThe necessarily-extensive use of estimates in assembling the\nfigures that appear in such deceptively precise form in the\nincome statement of property/casualty companies means that some\nerror must seep in, no matter how proper the intentions of\nmanagement. In an attempt to minimize error, most insurers use\nvarious statistical techniques to adjust the thousands of\nindividual loss evaluations (called case reserves) that comprise\nthe raw data for estimation of aggregate liabilities. The extra\nreserves created by these adjustments are variously labeled\nbulk, development, or supplemental reserves. The goal of\nthe adjustments should be a loss-reserve total that has a 50-50\nchance of being proved either slightly too high or slightly too\nlow when all losses that occurred prior to the date of the\nfinancial statement are ultimately paid.\n\nAt Berkshire, we have added what we thought were appropriate\nsupplemental reserves but in recent years they have not been\nadequate. It is important that you understand the magnitude of\nthe errors that have been involved in our reserving. You can\nthus see for yourselves just how imprecise the process is, and\nalso judge whether we may have some systemic bias that should\nmake you wary of our current and future figures.\n\nThe following table shows the results from insurance\nunderwriting as we have reported them to you in recent years, and\nalso gives you calculations a year later on an if-we-knew-thenwhat-we think-we-know-now basis. I say what we think we know\nnow because the adjusted figures still include a great many\nestimates for losses that occurred in the earlier years.\nHowever, many claims from the earlier years have been settled so\nthat our one-year-later estimate contains less guess work than\nour earlier estimate:\n\n",

    "content": "Errors in Loss Reserving\n\n\n\nOur structured settlement and loss-reserve assumption\nbusinesses are not included in this table. Important\nadditional information on loss reserve experience appears\non pages 43-45.\n\nTo help you understand this table, here is an explanation of\nthe most recent figures: 1984 s reported pre-tax underwriting\nloss of $45.4 million consists of $27.6 million we estimate that\nwe lost on 1984 s business, plus the increased loss of $17.8\nmillion reflected in the corrected figure for 1983.\n\nAs you can see from reviewing the table, my errors in\nreporting to you have been substantial and recently have always\npresented a better underwriting picture than was truly the case.\nThis is a source of particular chagrin to me because: (1) I like\nfor you to be able to count on what I say; (2) our insurance\nmanagers and I undoubtedly acted with less urgency than we would\nhave had we understood the full extent of our losses; and (3) we\npaid income taxes calculated on overstated earnings and thereby\ngave the government money that we didnt need to. (These\noverpayments eventually correct themselves, but the delay is long\nand we dont receive interest on the amounts we overpaid.)\n\nBecause our business is weighted toward casualty and\nreinsurance lines, we have more problems in estimating loss costs\nthan companies that specialize in property insurance. (When a\nbuilding that you have insured burns down, you get a much faster\nfix on your costs than you do when an employer you have insured\nfinds out that one of his retirees has contracted a disease\nattributable to work he did decades earlier.) But I still find\nour errors embarrassing. In our direct business, we have far\nunderestimated the mushrooming tendency of juries and courts to\nmake the deep pocket pay, regardless of the factual situation\nand the past precedents for establishment of liability. We also\nhave underestimated the contagious effect that publicity\nregarding giant awards has on juries. In the reinsurance area,\nwhere we have had our worst experience in under reserving, our\ncustomer insurance companies have made the same mistakes. Since\nwe set reserves based on information they supply us, their\nmistakes have become our mistakes.\n\nI heard a story recently that is applicable to our insurance\naccounting problems: a man was traveling abroad when he received\na call from his sister informing him that their father had died\nunexpectedly. It was physically impossible for the brother to\nget back home for the funeral, but he told his sister to take\ncare of the funeral arrangements and to send the bill to him.\nAfter returning home he received a bill for several thousand\ndollars, which he promptly paid. The following month another\nbill came along for $15, and he paid that too. Another month\nfollowed, with a similar bill. When, in the next month, a third\nbill for $15 was presented, he called his sister to ask what was\ngoing on. Oh, she said. I forgot to tell you. We buried Dad\nin a rented suit.\n\nIf youve been in the insurance business in recent years -\nparticularly the reinsurance business - this story hurts. We\nhave tried to include all of our rented suit liabilities in our\ncurrent financial statement, but our record of past error should\nmake us humble, and you suspicious. I will continue to report to\nyou the errors, plus or minus, that surface each year.\n\nNot all reserving errors in the industry have been of the\ninnocent-but-dumb variety. With underwriting results as bad as\nthey have been in recent years - and with managements having as\nmuch discretion as they do in the presentation of financial\nstatements - some unattractive aspects of human nature have\nmanifested themselves. Companies that would be out of business\nif they realistically appraised their loss costs have, in some\ncases, simply preferred to take an extraordinarily optimistic\nview about these yet-to-be-paid sums. Others have engaged in\nvarious transactions to hide true current loss costs.\n\nBoth of these approaches can work for a considerable time:\nexternal auditors cannot effectively police the financial\nstatements of property/casualty insurers. If liabilities of an\ninsurer, correctly stated, would exceed assets, it falls to the\ninsurer to volunteer this morbid information. In other words,\nthe corpse is supposed to file the death certificate. Under this\nhonor system of mortality, the corpse sometimes gives itself\nthe benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn most businesses, of course, insolvent companies run out\nof cash. Insurance is different: you can be broke but flush.\nSince cash comes in at the inception of an insurance policy and\nlosses are paid much later, insolvent insurers dont run out of\ncash until long after they have run out of net worth. In fact,\nthese walking dead often redouble their efforts to write\nbusiness, accepting almost any price or risk, simply to keep the\ncash flowing in. With an attitude like that of an embezzler who\nhas gambled away his purloined funds, these companies hope that\nsomehow they can get lucky on the next batch of business and\nthereby cover up earlier shortfalls. Even if they dont get\nlucky, the penalty to managers is usually no greater for a $100\nmillion shortfall than one of $10 million; in the meantime, while\nthe losses mount, the managers keep their jobs and perquisites.\n\nThe loss-reserving errors of other property/casualty\ncompanies are of more than academic interest to Berkshire. Not\nonly does Berkshire suffer from sell-at-any-price competition by\nthe walking dead, but we also suffer when their insolvency is\nfinally acknowledged. Through various state guarantee funds that\nlevy assessments, Berkshire ends up paying a portion of the\ninsolvent insurers asset deficiencies, swollen as they usually\nare by the delayed detection that results from wrong reporting.\nThere is even some potential for cascading trouble. The\ninsolvency of a few large insurers and the assessments by state\nguarantee funds that would follow could imperil weak-butpreviously-solvent insurers. Such dangers can be mitigated if\nstate regulators become better at prompt identification and\ntermination of insolvent insurers, but progress on that front has\nbeen slow.\n",

    "content": "\nWashington Public Power Supply System\n\nFrom October, 1983 through June, 1984 Berkshires insurance\nsubsidiaries continuously purchased large quantities of bonds of\nProjects 1,2, and 3 of Washington Public Power Supply System\n(WPPSS). This is the same entity that, on July 1,1983,\ndefaulted on $2.2 billion of bonds issued to finance partial\nconstruction of the now-abandoned Projects 4 and 5. While there\nare material differences in the obligors, promises, and\nproperties underlying the two categories of bonds, the problems\nof Projects 4 and 5 have cast a major cloud over Projects 1,2,\nand 3, and might possibly cause serious problems for the latter\nissues. In addition, there have been a multitude of problems\nrelated directly to Projects 1,2, and 3 that could weaken or\ndestroy an otherwise strong credit position arising from\nguarantees by Bonneville Power Administration.\n\nDespite these important negatives, Charlie and I judged the\nrisks\nat the time we purchased the bonds and at the prices\nBerkshire paid\n(much lower than present prices) to be\nconsiderably more than compensated for by prospects of profit.\n\nAs you know, we buy marketable stocks for our insurance\ncompanies based upon the criteria we would apply in the purchase\nof an entire business. This business-valuation approach is not\nwidespread among professional money managers and is scorned by\nmany academics. Nevertheless, it has served its followers well\n(to which the academics seem to say, Well, it may be all right\nin practice, but it will never work in theory.) Simply put, we\nfeel that if we can buy small pieces of businesses with\nsatisfactory underlying economics at a fraction of the per-share\nvalue of the entire business, something good is likely to happen\nto us - particularly if we own a group of such securities.\n\nWe extend this business-valuation approach even to bond\npurchases such as WPPSS. We compare the $139 million cost of our\nyearend investment in WPPSS to a similar $139 million investment\nin an operating business. In the case of WPPSS, the business\ncontractually earns $22.7 million after tax (via the interest\npaid on the bonds), and those earnings are available to us\ncurrently in cash. We are unable to buy operating businesses\nwith economics close to these. Only a relatively few businesses\nearn the 16.3% after tax on unleveraged capital that our WPPSS\ninvestment does and those businesses, when available for\npurchase, sell at large premiums to that capital. In the average\nnegotiated business transaction, unleveraged corporate earnings\nof $22.7 million after-tax (equivalent to about $45 million pretax) might command a price of $250 - $300 million (or sometimes\nfar more). For a business we understand well and strongly like,\nwe will gladly pay that much. But it is double the price we paid\nto realize the same earnings from WPPSS bonds.\n\nHowever, in the case of WPPSS, there is what we view to be a\nvery slight risk that the business could be worth nothing\nwithin a year or two. There also is the risk that interest\npayments might be interrupted for a considerable period of time.\nFurthermore, the most that the business could be worth is about\nthe $205 million face value of the bonds that we own, an amount\nonly 48% higher than the price we paid.\n\nThis ceiling on upside potential is an important minus. It\nshould be realized, however, that the great majority of operating\nbusinesses have a limited upside potential also unless more\ncapital is continuously invested in them. That is so because\nmost businesses are unable to significantly improve their average\nreturns on equity - even under inflationary conditions, though\nthese were once thought to automatically raise returns.\n\n(Lets push our bond-as-a-business example one notch\nfurther: if you elect to retain the annual earnings of a 12%\nbond by using the proceeds from coupons to buy more bonds,\nearnings of that bond business will grow at a rate comparable\nto that of most operating businesses that similarly reinvest all\nearnings. In the first instance, a 30-year, zero-coupon, 12%\nbond purchased today for $10 million will be worth $300 million\nin 2015. In the second, a $10 million business that regularly\nearns 12% on equity and retains all earnings to grow, will also\nend up with $300 million of capital in 2015. Both the business\nand the bond will earn over $32 million in the final year.)\n\nOur approach to bond investment - treating it as an unusual\nsort of business with special advantages and disadvantages -\nmay strike you as a bit quirky. However, we believe that many\nstaggering errors by investors could have been avoided if they\nhad viewed bond investment with a businessmans perspective. For\nexample, in 1946,20-year AAA tax-exempt bonds traded at slightly\nbelow a 1% yield. In effect, the buyer of those bonds at that\ntime bought a business that earned about 1% on book value\n(and that, moreover, could never earn a dime more than 1% on\nbook), and paid 100 cents on the dollar for that abominable\nbusiness.\n\nIf an investor had been business-minded enough to think in\nthose terms - and that was the precise reality of the bargain\nstruck - he would have laughed at the proposition and walked\naway. For, at the same time, businesses with excellent future\nprospects could have been bought at, or close to, book value\nwhile earning 10%, 12%, or 15% after tax on book. Probably no\nbusiness in America changed hands in 1946 at book value that the\nbuyer believed lacked the ability to earn more than 1% on book.\nBut investors with bond-buying habits eagerly made economic\ncommitments throughout the year on just that basis. Similar,\nalthough less extreme, conditions prevailed for the next two\ndecades as bond investors happily signed up for twenty or thirty\nyears on terms outrageously inadequate by business standards.\n(In what I think is by far the best book on investing ever\nwritten - The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham - the last\nsection of the last chapter begins with, Investment is most\nintelligent when it is most businesslike. This section is called\nA Final Word, and it is appropriately titled.)",

    "content": "Washington Public Power Supply System\n\nWe will emphasize again that there is unquestionably some\nrisk in the WPPSS commitment. It is also the sort of risk that\nis difficult to evaluate. Were Charlie and I to deal with 50\nsimilar evaluations over a lifetime, we would expect our judgment\nto prove reasonably satisfactory. But we do not get the chance\nto make 50 or even 5 such decisions in a single year. Even\nthough our long-term results may turn out fine, in any given year\nwe run a risk that we will look extraordinarily foolish. (Thats\nwhy all of these sentences say Charlie and I, or we.)\n\nMost managers have very little incentive to make the\nintelligent-but-with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot\ndecision. Their personal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if\nan unconventional decision works out well, they get a pat on the\nback and, if it works out poorly, they get a pink slip. (Failing\nconventionally is the route to go; as a group, lemmings may have\na rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever received bad\npress.)\n\nOur equation is different. With 47% of Berkshires stock,\nCharlie and I dont worry about being fired, and we receive our\nrewards as owners, not managers. Thus we behave with Berkshires\nmoney as we would with our own. That frequently leads us to\nunconventional behavior both in investments and general business\nmanagement.\n\nWe remain unconventional in the degree to which we\nconcentrate the investments of our insurance companies, including\nthose in WPPSS bonds. This concentration makes sense only\nbecause our insurance business is conducted from a position of\nexceptional financial strength. For almost all other insurers, a\ncomparable degree of concentration (or anything close to it)\nwould be totally inappropriate. Their capital positions are not\nstrong enough to withstand a big error, no matter how attractive\nan investment opportunity might appear when analyzed on the basis\nof probabilities.\n\nWith our financial strength we can own large blocks of a few\nsecurities that we have thought hard about and bought at\nattractive prices. (Billy Rose described the problem of overdiversification: If you have a harem of forty women, you never\nget to know any of them very well.) Over time our policy of\nconcentration should produce superior results, though these will\nbe tempered by our large size. When this policy produces a\nreally bad year, as it must, at least you will know that our\nmoney was committed on the same basis as yours.\n\nWe made the major part of our WPPSS investment at different\nprices and under somewhat different factual circumstances than\nexist at present. If we decide to change our position, we will\nnot inform shareholders until long after the change has been\ncompleted. (We may be buying or selling as you read this.) The\nbuying and selling of securities is a competitive business, and\neven a modest amount of added competition on either side can cost\nus a great deal of money. Our WPPSS purchases illustrate this\nprinciple. From October, 1983 through June, 1984, we attempted\nto buy almost all the bonds that we could of Projects 1,2, and\n3. Yet we purchased less than 3% of the bonds outstanding. Had\nwe faced even a few additional well-heeled investors, stimulated\nto buy because they knew we were, we could have ended up with a\nmaterially smaller amount of bonds, purchased at a materially\nhigher price. (A couple of coat-tail riders easily could have\ncost us $5 million.) For this reason, we will not comment about\nour activities in securities - neither to the press, nor\nshareholders, nor to anyone else - unless legally required to do\nso.\n\nOne final observation regarding our WPPSS purchases: we\ndislike the purchase of most long-term bonds under most\ncircumstances and have bought very few in recent years. Thats\nbecause bonds are as sound as a dollar - and we view the longterm outlook for dollars as dismal. We believe substantial\ninflation lies ahead, although we have no idea what the average\nrate will turn out to be. Furthermore, we think there is a\nsmall, but not insignificant, chance of runaway inflation.\n\nSuch a possibility may seem absurd, considering the rate to\nwhich inflation has dropped. But we believe that present fiscal\npolicy - featuring a huge deficit - is both extremely dangerous\nand difficult to reverse. (So far, most politicians in both\nparties have followed Charlie Browns advice: No problem is so\nbig that it cant be run away from.) Without a reversal, high\nrates of inflation may be delayed (perhaps for a long time), but\nwill not be avoided. If high rates materialize, they bring with\nthem the potential for a runaway upward spiral.\n\nWhile there is not much to choose between bonds and stocks\n(as a class) when annual inflation is in the 5%-10% range,\nrunaway inflation is a different story. In that circumstance, a\ndiversified stock portfolio would almost surely suffer an\nenormous loss in real value. But bonds already outstanding would\nsuffer far more. Thus, we think an all-bond portfolio carries a\nsmall but unacceptable wipe out risk, and we require any\npurchase of long-term bonds to clear a special hurdle. Only when\nbond purchases appear decidedly superior to other business\nopportunities will we engage in them. Those occasions are likely\nto be few and far between.\n",

    "content": "\nDividend Policy\n\nDividend policy is often reported to shareholders, but\nseldom explained. A company will say something like, Our goal\nis to pay out 40% to 50% of earnings and to increase dividends at\na rate at least equal to the rise in the CPI. And thats it -\nno analysis will be supplied as to why that particular policy is\nbest for the owners of the business. Yet, allocation of capital\nis crucial to business and investment management. Because it is,\nwe believe managers and owners should think hard about the\ncircumstances under which earnings should be retained and under\nwhich they should be distributed.\n\nThe first point to understand is that all earnings are not\ncreated equal. In many businesses particularly those that have\nhigh asset/profit ratios - inflation causes some or all of the\nreported earnings to become ersatz. The ersatz portion - lets\ncall these earnings restricted - cannot, if the business is to\nretain its economic position, be distributed as dividends. Were\nthese earnings to be paid out, the business would lose ground in\none or more of the following areas: its ability to maintain its\nunit volume of sales, its long-term competitive position, its\nfinancial strength. No matter how conservative its payout ratio,\na company that consistently distributes restricted earnings is\ndestined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise infused.\n\nRestricted earnings are seldom valueless to owners, but they\noften must be discounted heavily. In effect, they are\nconscripted by the business, no matter how poor its economic\npotential. (This retention-no-matter-how-unattractive-the-return\nsituation was communicated unwittingly in a marvelously ironic\nway by Consolidated Edison a decade ago. At the time, a punitive\nregulatory policy was a major factor causing the companys stock\nto sell as low as one-fourth of book value; i. e., every time a\ndollar of earnings was retained for reinvestment in the business,\nthat dollar was transformed into only 25 cents of market value.\nBut, despite this gold-into-lead process, most earnings were\nreinvested in the business rather than paid to owners.\nMeanwhile, at construction and maintenance sites throughout New\nYork, signs proudly proclaimed the corporate slogan, Dig We\nMust.)\n\nRestricted earnings need not concern us further in this\ndividend discussion. Lets turn to the much-more-valued\nunrestricted variety. These earnings may, with equal\nfeasibility, be retained or distributed. In our opinion,\nmanagement should choose whichever course makes greater sense for\nthe owners of the business.\n\nThis principle is not universally accepted. For a number of\nreasons managers like to withhold unrestricted, readily\ndistributable earnings from shareholders - to expand the\ncorporate empire over which the managers rule, to operate from a\nposition of exceptional financial comfort, etc. But we believe\nthere is only one valid reason for retention. Unrestricted\nearnings should be retained only when there is a reasonable\nprospect - backed preferably by historical evidence or, when\nappropriate, by a thoughtful analysis of the future - that\nfor\nevery dollar retained by the corporation, at least one dollar of\nmarket value will be created for owners.\nThis will happen only\nif the capital retained produces incremental earnings equal to,\nor above, those generally available to investors.\n\nTo illustrate, lets assume that an investor owns a riskfree 10% perpetual bond with one very unusual feature. Each year\nthe investor can elect either to take his 10% coupon in cash, or\nto reinvest the coupon in more 10% bonds with identical terms;\ni. e., a perpetual life and coupons offering the same cash-orreinvest option. If, in any given year, the prevailing interest\nrate on long-term, risk-free bonds is 5%, it would be foolish for\nthe investor to take his coupon in cash since the 10% bonds he\ncould instead choose would be worth considerably more than 100\ncents on the dollar. Under these circumstances, the investor\nwanting to get his hands on cash should take his coupon in\nadditional bonds and then immediately sell them. By doing that,\nhe would realize more cash than if he had taken his coupon\ndirectly in cash. Assuming all bonds were held by rational\ninvestors, no one would opt for cash in an era of 5% interest\nrates, not even those bondholders needing cash for living\npurposes.\n\nIf, however, interest rates were 15%, no rational investor\nwould want his money invested for him at 10%. Instead, the\ninvestor would choose to take his coupon in cash, even if his\npersonal cash needs were nil. The opposite course - reinvestment\nof the coupon - would give an investor additional bonds with\nmarket value far less than the cash he could have elected. If he\nshould want 10% bonds, he can simply take the cash received\nand buy them in the market, where they will be available at a\nlarge discount.",

    "content": "Dividend Policy\n\nAn analysis similar to that made by our hypothetical\nbondholder is appropriate for owners in thinking about whether a\ncompanys unrestricted earnings should be retained or paid out.\nOf course, the analysis is much more difficult and subject to\nerror because the rate earned on reinvested earnings is not a\ncontractual figure, as in our bond case, but rather a fluctuating\nfigure. Owners must guess as to what the rate will average over\nthe intermediate future. However, once an informed guess is\nmade, the rest of the analysis is simple: you should wish your\nearnings to be reinvested if they can be expected to earn high\nreturns, and you should wish them paid to you if low returns are\nthe likely outcome of reinvestment.\n\nMany corporate managers reason very much along these lines\nin determining whether subsidiaries should distribute earnings to\ntheir parent company. At that level,. the managers have no\ntrouble thinking like intelligent owners. But payout decisions\nat the parent company level often are a different story. Here\nmanagers frequently have trouble putting themselves in the shoes\nof their shareholder-owners.\n\nWith this schizoid approach, the CEO of a multi-divisional\ncompany will instruct Subsidiary A, whose earnings on incremental\ncapital may be expected to average 5%, to distribute all\navailable earnings in order that they may be invested in\nSubsidiary B, whose earnings on incremental capital are expected\nto be 15%. The CEOs business school oath will allow no lesser\nbehavior. But if his own long-term record with incremental\ncapital is 5% - and market rates are 10% - he is likely to impose\na dividend policy on shareholders of the parent company that\nmerely follows some historical or industry-wide payout pattern.\nFurthermore, he will expect managers of subsidiaries to give him\na full account as to why it makes sense for earnings to be\nretained in their operations rather than distributed to the\nparent-owner. But seldom will he supply his owners with a\nsimilar analysis pertaining to the whole company.\n\nIn judging whether managers should retain earnings,\nshareholders should not simply compare total incremental earnings\nin recent years to total incremental capital because that\nrelationship may be distorted by what is going on in a core\nbusiness. During an inflationary period, companies with a core\nbusiness characterized by extraordinary economics can use small\namounts of incremental capital in that business at very high\nrates of return (as was discussed in last years section on\nGoodwill). But, unless they are experiencing tremendous unit\ngrowth, outstanding businesses by definition generate large\namounts of excess cash. If a company sinks most of this money in\nother businesses that earn low returns, the companys overall\nreturn on retained capital may nevertheless appear excellent\nbecause of the extraordinary returns being earned by the portion\nof earnings incrementally invested in the core business. The\nsituation is analogous to a Pro-Am golf event: even if all of the\namateurs are hopeless duffers, the teams best-ball score will be\nrespectable because of the dominating skills of the professional.\n\nMany corporations that consistently show good returns both\non equity and on overall incremental capital have, indeed,\nemployed a large portion of their retained earnings on an\neconomically unattractive, even disastrous, basis. Their\nmarvelous core businesses, however, whose earnings grow year\nafter year, camouflage repeated failures in capital allocation\nelsewhere (usually involving high-priced acquisitions of\nbusinesses that have inherently mediocre economics). The\nmanagers at fault periodically report on the lessons they have\nlearned from the latest disappointment. They then usually seek\nout future lessons. (Failure seems to go to their heads.)\n\nIn such cases, shareholders would be far better off if\nearnings were retained only to expand the high-return business,\nwith the balance paid in dividends or used to repurchase stock\n(an action that increases the owners interest in the exceptional\nbusiness while sparing them participation in subpar businesses).\nManagers of high-return businesses who consistently employ much\nof the cash thrown off by those businesses in other ventures with\nlow returns should be held to account for those allocation\ndecisions, regardless of how profitable the overall enterprise\nis.\n\nNothing in this discussion is intended to argue for\ndividends that bounce around from quarter to quarter with each\nwiggle in earnings or in investment opportunities. Shareholders\nof public corporations understandably prefer that dividends be\nconsistent and predictable. Payments, therefore, should reflect\nlong-term expectations for both earnings and returns on\nincremental capital. Since the long-term corporate outlook\nchanges only infrequently, dividend patterns should change no\nmore often. But over time distributable earnings that have been\nwithheld by managers should earn their keep. If earnings have\nbeen unwisely retained, it is likely that managers, too, have\nbeen unwisely retained.\n\nLets now turn to Berkshire Hathaway and examine how these\ndividend principles apply to it. Historically, Berkshire has\nearned well over market rates on retained earnings, thereby\ncreating over one dollar of market value for every dollar\nretained. Under such circumstances, any distribution would have\nbeen contrary to the financial interest of shareholders, large or\nsmall.",

These\ncornerstone businesses (carefully chosen, it should be noted, by\nyour Chairman and Vice Chairman) have, respectively, (1) survived\nbut earned almost nothing, (2) shriveled in size while incurring\nlarge losses, and (3) shrunk in sales volume to about 5% its size\nat the time of our entry. (Who says you cant lose em all?)\nOnly by committing available funds to much better businesses were\nwe able to overcome these origins. (Its been like overcoming a\nmisspent youth.) Clearly, diversification has served us well.\n\nWe expect to continue to diversify while also supporting the\ngrowth of current operations though, as weve pointed out, our\nreturns from these efforts will surely be below our historical\nreturns. But as long as prospective returns are above the rate\nrequired to produce a dollar of market value per dollar retained,\nwe will continue to retain all earnings. Should our estimate of\nfuture returns fall below that point, we will distribute all\nunrestricted earnings that we believe can not be effectively\nused. In making that judgment, we will look at both our\nhistorical record and our prospects. Because our year-to-year\nresults are inherently volatile, we believe a five-year rolling\naverage to be appropriate for judging the historical record.\n\nOur present plan is to use our retained earnings to further\nbuild the capital of our insurance companies. Most of our\ncompetitors are in weakened financial condition and reluctant to\nexpand substantially. Yet large premium-volume gains for the\nindustry are imminent, amounting probably to well over $15\nbillion in 1985 versus less than $5 billion in 1983. These\ncircumstances could produce major amounts of profitable business\nfor us. Of course, this result is no sure thing, but prospects\nfor it are far better than they have been for many years.\n",

We immediately pursued this idea, and only\na chance complication prevented a deal. Since our ad is pulling,\nwe will repeat it in precisely last years form:\n\nWe prefer:\n(1) large purchases (at least $5 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\nturn-around situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we\nwont understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\n\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested. We prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuance of stock when we\nreceive as much in intrinsic business value as we give. We\ninvite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past. For the right\nbusiness - and the right people - we can provide a good home.\n\n* * *\n\nA record 97.2% of all eligible shares participated in\nBerkshires 1984 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nTotal contributions made through this program were $3,179,000,\nand 1,519 charities were recipients. Our proxy material for the\nannual meeting will allow you to cast an advisory vote expressing\nyour views about this program - whether you think we should\ncontinue it and, if so, at what per-share level. (You may be\ninterested to learn that we were unable to find a precedent for\nan advisory vote in which management seeks the opinions of\nshareholders about owner-related corporate policies. Managers\nwho put their trust in capitalism seem in no hurry to put their\ntrust in capitalists.)\n\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 60 and 61. If you wish to participate in future programs,\nwe strongly urge that you immediately make sure that your shares\nare registered in the name of the actual owner, not in street\nname or nominee name. Shares not so registered on September 30,1985 will be ineligible for the 1985 program.\n\n",

    "content": "Annual Meeting, Closing, and Subsequent Event\n\n* * *\n\nOur annual meeting will be on May 21,1985 in Omaha, and I\nhope that you attend. Many annual meetings are a waste of time,\nboth for shareholders and for management. Sometimes that is true\nbecause management is reluctant to open up on matters of business\nsubstance. More often a nonproductive session is the fault of\nshareholder participants who are more concerned about their own\nmoment on stage than they are about the affairs of the\ncorporation. What should be a forum for business discussion\nbecomes a forum for theatrics, spleen-venting and advocacy of\nissues. (The deal is irresistible: for the price of one share you\nget to tell a captive audience your ideas as to how the world\nshould be run.) Under such circumstances, the quality of the\nmeeting often deteriorates from year to year as the antics of\nthose interested in themselves discourage attendance by those\ninterested in the business.\n\nBerkshires meetings are a different story. The number of\nshareholders attending grows a bit each year and we have yet to\nexperience a silly question or an ego-inspired commentary.\nInstead, we get a wide variety of thoughtful questions about the\nbusiness. Because the annual meeting is the time and place for\nthese, Charlie and I are happy to answer them all, no matter how\nlong it takes. (We cannot, however, respond to written or phoned\nquestions at other times of the year; one-person-at-a time\nreporting is a poor use of management time in a company with 3000\nshareholders.) The only business matters that are off limits at\nthe annual meeting are those about which candor might cost our\ncompany real money. Our activities in securities would be the\nmain example.\n\nWe always have bragged a bit on these pages about the\nquality of our shareholder-partners. Come to the annual meeting\nand you will see why. Out-of-towners should schedule a stop at\nNebraska Furniture Mart. If you make some purchases, youll save\nfar more than enough to pay for your trip, and youll enjoy the\nexperience.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 25,1985 Chairman of the Board\n\nSubsequent Event: On March 18, a week after copy for this\nreport went to the typographer but shortly before production, we\nagreed to purchase three million shares of Capital Cities\nCommunications, Inc. at $172.50 per share. Our purchase is\ncontingent upon the acquisition of American Broadcasting\nCompanies, Inc. by Capital Cities, and will close when that\ntransaction closes. At the earliest, that will be very late in\n1985. Our admiration for the management of Capital Cities, led\nby Tom Murphy and Dan Burke, has been expressed several times in\nprevious annual reports. Quite simply, they are tops in both\nability and integrity. We will have more to say about this\ninvestment in next years report.",
