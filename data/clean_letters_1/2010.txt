Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results

BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC.

The per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over the
last46years(thatis,sincepresentmanagementtookover),bookvaluehasgrownfrom$19to$95,453,arateof
20.2%compoundedannually.*
Thehighlight of 2010 wasour acquisition of Burlington NorthernSantaFe,apurchase that’s working
out even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire’s “normal”
earning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share
count by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we’ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this
transactionhaveturnedoutverywell.
A “normal year,” of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire
andmypartner,orIcandefinewithanythinglikeprecision.Butforthepurposeofestimatingourcurrentearning
power, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business
climate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, and
severalothersthatIwillexplaininthe“Investment”section,Icanestimatethatthenormalearningpowerofthe
assets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains or
losses.EverydayCharlieandIthinkabouthowwecanbuildonthisbase.
Both of us are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmental
advantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record
500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means

Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full
share of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better
situated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our
checkswillclear.
Lastyear–inthefaceofwidespreadpessimismaboutoureconomy–wedemonstratedourenthusiasm
for capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount,

Money will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.
Commentators today often talk of “great uncertainty.” But think back, for example, to December 6,
1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always
uncertain.

Performance
Charlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish
performance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot
thearrowofperformanceandthenpaintthebull’s-eyearoundwhereveritlands.
In Berkshire’s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate
greaterthantheincrease(includingdividends)oftheS&P500.Insomeyearswesucceed;inotherswefail.But,
if we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves could
haverealizedanequalorbetterresultbyowninganindexfund.
The challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me
separately,andyouwillgettwodifferentanswers.Precisionjustisn’tpossible.
To eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value – book value –
when measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying
value on our books. (Later in this report, we’ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swings
wildlyfromyeartoyear,bookvaluecanserveasareasonabledevicefortrackinghowwearedoing.

capital we currently manage eliminate any chance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, for
better-than-averageresultsandfeelitfairforyoutoholdustothatstandard.
Yearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of
the earth’s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas or
operating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year on
advertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amount
productively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many large
investmentsatourrailroadandutilityoperationsarealsomadewithaneyetopayoffswelldowntheroad.
To provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly
figures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tell
aninterestingstory.Onacomparativebasis,ourbestyearsendedintheearly1980s.Themarket’sgoldenperiod,
however, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relative
advantagenarrowed.
After 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory
performance relative to the S&P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absolute
results.
Looking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&P – though that result is, of
course,farfromasurething.Ifwesucceedinthataim,wewillalmostcertainlyproducebetterrelativeresultsin

IntrinsicValue–TodayandTomorrow
Though Berkshire’s intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated, two of its three key pillars can be
measured. Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire’s
value.
Thefirst component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cashequivalents. Atyearendthese
totaled$158billionatmarketvalue.
Insurance float – money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us –
funds$66billionofourinvestments.Thisfloatis“free”aslongasinsuranceunderwritingbreakseven,meaning
thatthepremiumswereceiveequalthelossesandexpensesweincur.Ofcourse,underwritingresultsarevolatile,
swinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we’ve been significantly
profitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of our
investments – those funded both by float and by retained earnings – can be viewed as an element of value for
Berkshireshareholders.
Berkshire’ssecondcomponentofvalueisearningsthatcomefromsourcesotherthaninvestmentsand
insuranceunderwriting.Theseearningsaredeliveredbyour68non-insurancecompanies,itemizedonpage106.
In Berkshire’s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we’ve
increasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that will
continue.
The following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade
intervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investments
applicabletominorityinterests.
Per-Share CompoundedAnnualIncrease
Yearend Investments Period inPer-ShareInvestments
1970 ................... $ 66
1980 ................... 754 1970-1980 27.5%

2000 ................... 50,229 1990-2000 20.5%
2010 ................... 94,730 2000-2010 6.6%
Though our compounded annual increase in per-share investments was a healthy 19.9% over the
40-year period, our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operating
businesses.
The payoff from this shift is shown in the following table, which illustrates how earnings of our
non-insurancebusinesseshaveincreased,againonaper-sharebasisandafterapplicableminorityinterests.

valueoftenfollowverydifferentpaths–sometimesforextendedperiods–buteventuallytheymeet.
There is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or
negative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many other
businesses,arelikelytoretainearningsoverthenextdecadethatwillequal,orevenexceed,thecapitalwepresently
employ.Somecompanieswillturntheseretaineddollarsintofifty-centpieces,othersintotwo-dollarbills.
This “what-will-they-do-with-the-money” factor must always be evaluated along with the
“what-do-we-have-now” calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company’s
intrinsic value.That’sbecauseanoutside investor stands byhelplessly asmanagement reinvests hisshareofthe
company’s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to the
company’s current value; if the CEO’s talents or motives are suspect, today’s value must be discounted. The
difference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck’s or Montgomery

************
CharlieandIhopethattheper-shareearningsofournon-insurancebusinessescontinuetoincreaseata
decent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from our
current businesses and more major acquisitions. We’re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my
triggerfingerisitchy.
Partially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a
cadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.
Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They are
volunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can’t be lured
away.
At Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at
headquartersnorfinancingworriesnorWallStreetharassment.Theysimplygetaletterfrommeeverytwoyears

composedofall-starshavingvastlydifferentbattingstyles.Changesinourline-upareseldomrequired.
Our second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the
needs of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves to
reinvestingfundswithintheindustryinwhichtheyhavebeenoperating.Thatoftenrestrictsthem,however,toa
“universe” for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.

When I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn’t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in
textiles,whereithadinthepreviousdecadelostsignificantmoney.ThedumbestthingIcouldhavedonewasto
pursue “opportunities” to improve and expand the existing textile operation – so for years that’s exactly what I
did. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh!
EventuallyIcametomysenses,headingfirstintoinsuranceandthenintootherindustries.
There is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the
attractionsofonebusinessagainstahostofothers,wealsomeasurebusinessesagainstopportunitiesavailablein
marketable securities, a comparison most managements don’t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculously

alsotwoofferinglimitedreinvestmentopportunities)anduseitaspartofthestakeweneededtobuyBNSF.
Our final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses,
culturecounts.
To start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token
compensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide them
directors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess up

Berkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire’s actions and results
withkeeninterestandanowner’seye.YouandIareluckytohavethemasstewards.
This same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people whohave
soughtoutBerkshireasanacquirerforabusinessthattheyandtheirfamilieshavelongowned.Theycametous
with an owner’s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managers

Cultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, “You shape your houses and then they shape
you.”Thatwisdomappliestobusinessesaswell.Bureaucratic proceduresbegetmorebureaucracy,andimperial
corporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, “You know you’re no longer CEO when you
get in the back seat of your car and it doesn’t move.”) At Berkshire’s “World Headquarters” our annual rent is
$270,212. Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-tech
equipment – you name it – totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own,

GEICO
Nowlet me tell youastory thatwillhelpyouunderstand howtheintrinsic valueofabusiness canfar
exceeditsbookvalue.Relatingthistalealsogivesmeachancetorelivesomegreatmemories.
Sixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a
20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a
once-a-weekclassattheschool.
8
One day at the library, I checked out Ben’s entry in Who’s Who in America and found he was
chairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had
never heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, after
readingthepageonGEICO,Idecidedtovisitthecompany.ThefollowingSaturday,Iboardedanearlytrainfor
Washington.
Alas, when I arrived at the company’s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically
startedpoundingonadoor,untilfinallyajanitorappeared.IaskedhimiftherewasanyoneintheofficeIcould
talkto,andhesteeredmetotheonlypersonaround,LorimerDavidson.
That was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, “Davy” gave me an education about both
insurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated from
ColumbiaandbecameastocksalesmaninOmaha.GEICO,ofcourse,wasmyprimerecommendation,whichgot
me off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon after
meetingDavy,Imadethestock75%ofmy$9,800investmentportfolio.(Evenso,Ifeltover-diversified.)
Subsequently,DavybecameCEOofGEICO,takingthecompanytoundreamed-ofheightsbeforeitgot
into trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened – with the stock falling by
more than 95% – Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the years
increasedto50%becauseofGEICO’srepurchasesofitsownshares.Berkshire’scostforthishalfofthebusiness
was$46million.(Despitethesizeofourposition,weexercisednocontroloveroperations.)
Wethenpurchasedtheremaining50%ofGEICOatthebeginningof1996,whichspurredDavy,at95,

When Tony Nicely, GEICO’s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had

The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimated
GEICO’s“goodwill”tobeworthatthattime.Thatgoodwillrepresentedtheeconomicvalueofthepolicyholders
who were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in
premiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were
annually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary
insurer:Becauseofthecompany’slowcosts,itspolicyholderswereconsistentlyprofitableandunusuallyloyal.
Today, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our
books at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO
increases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value
decreases,butleaveitunchangedifeconomicvalueincreases.)Usingthe97%-of-premium-volumeyardstickwe

Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and
incomecharacteristicsfromtheothers.Lumpingthemtogetherthereforeimpedesanalysis.Sowe’llpresentthem
asfourseparatebusinesses,whichishowCharlieandIviewthem.
We will look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our
expansionovertheyears.
Insurance
Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,
such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This
collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to
others. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims
come and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.
Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at the
followingtable:
Float
Yearend (in$millions)
1970 ........................................ $ 39
1980 ........................................ 237
1990 ........................................ 1,632
2000 ........................................ 27,871
2010 ........................................ 65,832
Ifourpremiumsexceedthetotalofourexpensesandeventuallosses,weregisteranunderwritingprofit
that adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free
money–and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit.Alas,thewishofallinsurerstoachievethishappyresultcreates
intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a
significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State
Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss in
sevenofthelasttenyears.Duringthatperiod,itsaggregateunderwritinglosswasmorethan$20billion.
At Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total
underwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite
profitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better than
cost-free.Wewillbenefitjustaswewouldifsomepartydeposited$66billionwithus,paidusafeeforholding
itsmoneyandthenletusinvestitsfundsforourownbenefit.
10
Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a
whole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the
industry’s overall return ontangible equityhas for manydecades fallenfar short of the average returnrealizedby
American industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire’s outstanding economics exist only

A huge story in this sector’s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can’t overstate the
breadth and importance of Dave Sokol’s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional

We are now charging NetJets an appropriate fee for Berkshire’s guarantee. Despite this fee (which
came to $38 million in 2010), NetJets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918million from 2009.

Regulated,Capital-IntensiveBusinesses
We have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important common
characteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this
letterandsplitouttheirfinancialstatisticsinourGAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement.
A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated
assets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is
notneeded:Bothbusinesseshaveearningpowerthat,evenunderveryadversebusinessconditions,amplycovers
their interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF’s car loadings far off peak levels, the
company’sinterestcoveragewas6:1.
Both companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major
investments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn the
respect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earn
reasonableearningsonfuturecapitalinvestments.
Earlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country’s future. Rail moves 42% of

All of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American
economy’s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000miles of track along with
its ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society’s needs, not
merely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation,
with this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I’m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our huge
incrementalinvestments.Wiseregulationandwiseinvestmentaretwosidesofthesamecoin.

In our earlier estimate of Berkshire’s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to
future investment income (but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just
described).
The first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income
investments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these – our Swiss Re
note – was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others – our Goldman Sachs and General Electric
preferred stocks – are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in October
andhasstateditsintentiontodoso.GoldmanSachshastherighttocallourpreferredon30daysnotice,buthas
been held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light
beforelong.

Allthreeofthecompaniesredeemingmustpayusapremiumtodoso–inaggregateabout$1.4billion–
but all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly
reduced.That’sthebadnews.
There are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been
earning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least
$500million–andperhapsmuchmore–toourinvestmentincome.Thatsortofincreaseinmoney-marketyields
is unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of
“normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an
opportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To update
Aesop,agirlinaconvertibleisworthfiveinthephonebook.
Inaddition,dividendsonourcurrentcommonstockholdingswillalmostcertainlyincrease.Thelargest
gain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen
dividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though
consistentlyprosperingthroughouttheworstoftherecessionandcurrentlyenjoyingenormousfinancialstrength
andearningpower,hasthereforebeenforcedtomaintainanartificiallylowpayout.(Wedon’tfaulttheFed:For
variousreasons,anacross-the-boardfreezemadesenseduringthecrisisanditsimmediateaftermath.)
At some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the
rational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just
thisonesecuritytoincreasebyseveralhundredsofmillionsofdollarsannually.
Othercompanies weholdarelikely toincreasetheirdividendsaswell.Coca-Colapaidus$88million
in 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In
2011,wewillalmostcertainlyreceive$376millionfromCoke,up$24millionfromlastyear.Withintenyears,I
would expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share of
Coke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful
business.

When Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with

One footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a number of commentators

Derivatives
Two years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives
contracts(otherthanthoseusedforoperationsatoursubsidiaries,suchasMidAmerican,andthefewleftoverat
GenRe). Today,the comparable number is 203,a figure reflecting both a few additions toourportfolio andthe
unwindingorexpirationofsomecontracts.
Ourcontinuing positions, all ofwhichIampersonallyresponsiblefor,falllargelyintotwocategories.
Weviewbothcategories asengagingusininsurance-like activities inwhichwereceivepremiumsforassuming
risks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions are
identical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front when
weenterintothecontractsandthereforerunnocounterpartyrisk.That’simportant.
Ourfirst category of derivatives consists of a number ofcontracts, written in2004-2008,thatrequired
payments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minor
exceptions,wewereexposedtotheserisksforfiveyears,witheachcontractcovering100companies.
In aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in
our 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an “underwriting
profit,” meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we would
benefitfromtheuseoffloat.
19
Subsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A
number of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,
however,ourexposureislargelybehindusbecausemostofourhigher-riskcontractshaveexpired.Consequently,it
appearsalmostcertainthatwewillearnanunderwritingprofitasweoriginallyanticipated.Inaddition,wehavehad
the use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged the
rightpremium,andthatprotecteduswhenbusinessconditionsturnedterriblethreeyearsago.
Our other large derivatives position – whose contracts go by the name of “equity puts” – involves
insurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in the
U.S.,U.K.,EuropeandJapan.Thesecontractsaretiedtovariousequityindices,suchastheS&P500intheU.S.
and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of these
contracts,mostofwhichranfor15years.Onthesecontracts,onlythepriceoftheindicesontheterminationdate
counts:Nopaymentscanberequiredbeforethen.
Asafirststepinupdatingyouaboutthesecontracts,Icanreportthatlatein2010,attheinstigationof
our counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originally
received $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.
Consequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that
$647millionforaboutthreeyears.
Those 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On
these,attheirinitiation,wereceivedpremiumsof$4.2billion.
Thefutureofthesecontractsis,ofcourse,uncertain.Buthereisoneperspectiveonthem.Iftheprices

and foreign exchange rates are unchanged – we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to
2026.Youcancallthisamount“settlementvalue.”
On our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at
$6.7billion.Inotherwords,ifthepricesoftherelevantindicesremainunchangedfromthatdate,wewillrecord
a $2.9billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7billion and
thesettlementvalueof$3.8billion.Ibelievethatequitypriceswillverylikelyincreaseandthatourliabilitywill
fall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. Butthat,
ofcourse,isfarfromasurething.
Whatissureisthatwewillhavetheuseofourremaining“float”of$4.2billionforanaverageofabout
10moreyears.(Neither thisfloat northatarisingfromthehigh-yieldcontractsisincludedintheinsurancefloat
figure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase
ofBNSF.
As I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post
collateral – a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feeling
comfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.

OnReportingandMisreporting:TheNumbersThatCountandThoseThatDon’t
Earlierinthisletter,IpointedoutsomenumbersthatCharlieandIfindusefulinvaluingBerkshireand

Let’s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net
income. Important thoughthat numbermaybeatmost companies, itisalmost alwaysmeaningless atBerkshire.
Regardless of howour businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could–quitelegally –causenetincome inany

20
Wehavethatflexibility becauserealized gainsorlosses oninvestments gointothenetincomefigure,
whereas unrealized gains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a
$10billionincreaseinunrealizedgainsinagivenyearandconcurrentlyhad$1billionofrealizedlosses.Ournet

Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value.

righttrack.

Asap.s.,Ican’tresistpointingoutjusthowcapriciousreportednetincomecanbe.Hadourequityputs
hadaterminationdateofJune30,2010,wewouldhavebeenrequiredtopay$6.4billiontoourcounterpartiesat
that date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figure
down to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contracts
required us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change
that,aftertheeffectoftaxaccruals,reducedournetincomeforthequarterby$455million.
Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to
long-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our
money where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that
theBlack-Scholescalculationsusedbyourcounterpartiesortheircustomerswerefaulty.
Wecontinue,nevertheless, tousethatformulainpresentingourfinancial statements. Black-Scholesis
the accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would be
accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an
insurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-
Scholesvaluesforthesamecontractswehold.Itwouldbeimpossibleforourauditorstoattesttotheaccuracyof
boththeirvaluesandourswerethetwofarapart.
Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number.
Charlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that
calculated byBlack-Scholes, but wecan’t come up with an exact figure –anymore thanwecancomeupwitha
precise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t
botherus:Wewouldratherbeapproximatelyrightthanpreciselywrong.
John Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They
made the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly.
Witness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and
1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it “anomalies.” (I always love explanations of that kind:
The Flat Earth Society probably views a ship’s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential,
anomaly.)
21
Academics’currentpracticeofteachingBlack-Scholesasrevealedtruthneedsre-examination.Forthat
matter, so does the academic’s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as
an investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to

The fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is

A little personal history may partially explain our extreme aversion to financial adventurism. I didn’t

has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.” At Berkshire, we don’t rely on bank lines, and we
don’t enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation to
ourliquidassets.
Furthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past
40 years. Instead, we have retained all of our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running

The priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t be
perfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to lose
money – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.” We
must continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have
written about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written byan unfriendly but intelligent
reporter.
Sometimes your associates will say “Everybody else is doing it.” This rationale is almost always
a bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a
moral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they
can’t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter
ora judge and see howfar it gets them.
If you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call.
However, it’s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it’s too close to the line
and should be abandoned. There’s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it’s
questionable whether some action isclose to the line, just assume it isoutside and forget it.
As a corollary, let me know promptly if there’s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news
but I don’t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad
news is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that
almost caused the demise ofa firm with 8,000employees.

Somebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we
knew of it. That’s inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that number
getting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in
minimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of
impropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most
important factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines
howan organization behaves.
In other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you
does a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don’t need me to
help. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits and any
unusually large capital expenditures oracquisitions.
************
I need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retire
and I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.) But just in case you don’t, please send me a letter
(at home if you wish) giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should
become incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I’m no longer CEO, in
which case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of
your primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you have
participated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it’s
important to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have
your thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a few
operations that are run by two or more of you – such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at Applied
Underwriters, etc. – and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal,
handwritten, etc. Justmark it “Personal for Warren.”
Thanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make
my job easy.

P.S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercede
with the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will be
accompanied by “It can’t hurt to ask.” It will be easier for both of us if you just say “no.” As an added
favor, don’t suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 76 businesses by the periodic “I think he’ll
be interested in this one” and youcan understand whyit isbetter to saynofirmly and immediately.
