invest for Berkshire’s benefit. And if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive in
premiums, we additionally earn an underwriting profit, meaning the float costs us less than nothing.
Though we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time, we’ve now had nine consecutive
years of underwriting profits, totaling about $17 billion. Over the same nine years our float increased

• Three large and very attractive fixed-income investments were called awayfrom us bytheir issuers in
2011. Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeem
securities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That’s a lot of
incometoreplace,thoughourLubrizolpurchasedidoffsetmostofit.
• Last year, I told you that “a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.” I was dead
wrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. The
connection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country,
accountingforabout7%ofthoseconstructedduring2011.
Additionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and MiTek (building products,
primarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. In
aggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That’s
similarto2010butdownfrom$1.8billionin2006.
Housingwillcomeback–youcanbesureofthat.Overtime,thenumberofhousingunitsnecessarily
matches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period of
years prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, we

than housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormones

in-lawscanquicklyloseitsallure.
At our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts – considerably less than the number of new
households being formed – buyers and renters are sopping up what’s left of the old oversupply. (This
process will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varies
widely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter,
employing only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of the
economy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in a
depression of its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely
laggedthesteadyandsubstantialcomebackwehaveseeninalmostallothersectorsofoureconomy.
Wisemonetaryandfiscalpoliciesplayanimportantroleintemperingrecessions,butthesetoolsdon’t
create households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our market
system will restore the needed balance – probably before long. When that day comes, we will again
build one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how far
unemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776:

IntrinsicBusinessValue
Charlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic business
value. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks. If it
doesn’t,weareoverpaidatanyprice.
Wehavenowaytopinpointintrinsicvalue.Butwedohaveauseful,thoughconsiderablyunderstated,
proxy for it: per-share book value. This yardstick is meaningless at most companies. At Berkshire, however,
bookvalue very roughly tracks business values.That’s becausetheamount bywhichBerkshire’s intrinsic value
exceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year, though it increases in most years. Over time, the

We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course,
infractions – even serious ones – are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In other
instances,alessbenignconclusionseemswarranted.Itdoesn’tsufficetosaythatrepurchasesarebeingmadeto
offset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholders
are hurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation – whether the
moneyisslatedforacquisitionsorsharerepurchases–isthatwhatissmartatonepriceisdumbatanother.(One
CEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; I
recommendthatyoureadhisannualletter.)
Charlie and I have mixed emotions when Berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. We like
making money for continuing shareholders, and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset – our
own stock – that we know to be worth at least x for less than that – for .9x, .8x or even lower. (As one of our
directorssays,it’slikeshootingfishinabarrel,afterthebarrelhasbeendrainedandthefishhavequitflopping.)
Nevertheless, we don’t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even though our doing so may give the selling
shareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. When we are buying,
therefore,wewantthoseexitingpartnerstobefullyinformedaboutthevalueoftheassetstheyareselling.
At our limit price of 110% of book value, repurchases clearly increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic
value.Andthemoreandthecheaperwebuy,thegreaterthegainforcontinuingshareholders.Therefore,ifgiven
the opportunity, we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. You should know,
however,thatwehavenointerestinsupportingthestockandthatourbidswillfadeinparticularlyweakmarkets.
Nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strength

Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%.

Let’sdothemath.IfIBM’sstockpriceaverages,say,$200duringtheperiod,thecompanywillacquire
250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and we
would own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-year
period, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after
fiveyears,ofwhichwewouldown6.5%.

Thelogicissimple:Ifyouaregoingtobeanetbuyerofstocksinthefuture,eitherdirectlywithyourown

Insurance
Let’slookfirstatinsurance,Berkshire’scoreoperationandtheenginethathaspropelledourexpansion
overtheyears.
Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,
such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This
collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to
others. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims
come and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.
Consequently,asourbusinessgrows,sodoesourfloat.Andhowwehavegrown,asthefollowingtableshows:
Year Float(in$millions)
1970 $ 39
1980 237
1990 1,632
2000 27,871
2010 65,832

It’sunlikelythatourfloatwillgrowmuch–ifatall–fromitscurrentlevel.That’smainlybecausewe
alreadyhaveanoutsizedamountrelative toourpremiumvolume.Weretheretobeadeclineinfloat,Iwilladd,
itwouldalmostcertainlybeverygradualandthereforeimposenounusualdemandforfundsonus.
If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit
that adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free
money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy
result creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to
operateatasignificantunderwritingloss.Forexample,StateFarm,byfarthecountry’slargestinsurerandawell-managed
company besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There are
alotofwaystolosemoneyininsurance,andtheindustryisresourcefulincreatingnewones.
As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine
consecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to
underwrite profitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be
betterthancost-free.Wewillprofitjustaswewouldifsomepartydeposited$70.6billionwithus,paidusafee
forholdingitsmoneyandthenletusinvestitsfundsforourownbenefit.
So how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in full as a
liability in calculating Berkshire’s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable to
replenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. If
floatisbothcostlessandlong-enduring,thetruevalueofthisliabilityisfarlowerthantheaccountingliability.
Partially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” attributable to our insurance
companiesthatisincludedinbookvalueasanasset.Ineffect,thisgoodwillrepresents thepricewepaidforthe
float-generatingcapabilitiesofourinsuranceoperations.Thecostofthegoodwill,however,hasnobearingonits
true value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill asset
attributabletoitshouldbedeemedvalueless,whateveritsoriginalcost.
Fortunately, that’s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our
insurance goodwill – what we would pay to purchase float of similar quality – to be far in excess of its historic
carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic
businessvaluesubstantiallyexceedsbookvalue.

most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some
mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever faced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a
moderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. Concurrently, all other major insurers and
reinsurerswouldbefarinthered,andsomewouldfaceinsolvency.
From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $34 billion and
significant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By these
accomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Charlie would gladly
trademeforasecondAjit.Alas,thereisnone.

At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all
exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposure
actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,
after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the
appropriatepremiumcan’tbeobtained.

that their competitors are eagerly writing. That old line, “The other guy is doing it so we must as well,” spells
trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Indeed, a good underwriter needs an independent

Regulated,Capital-IntensiveBusinesses
We have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important common
characteristicsdistinguishingthemfromourmanyotherbusinesses.Consequently,weassignthemtheirownsector
inthisletterandalsosplitouttheircombinedfinancialstatisticsinourGAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement.
A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated
assets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our
credit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amply
covers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF’s interest
coverage was 9.5x. At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all
circumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and a
diversityofearningsstreams,whichshielditfromtheactionsofanysingleregulatorybody.
Measured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America’s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more than
any other railroad – about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of all inter-city
ton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as the

Tofulfillitssocietalobligation,BNSFregularlyinvestsfarmorethanitsdepreciationcharge,withthe
excess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays.
Though many people decry our country’s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be levied
against the railroad industry. It is pouring money – funds from the private sector – into the investment projects
needed to provide better and more extensive service in the future. If railroads were not making these huge
expenditures, our country’s publicly-financed highway system would face even greater congestion and
maintenanceproblemsthanexisttoday.
Massive investments of thesortthatBNSFismakingwouldbefoolish ifitcouldnotearnappropriate
returns on the incremental sums it commits. But I am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers.
Many years ago Ben Franklin counseled, “Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.” Translating this to our
regulated businesses, he might today say, “Take care of your customer, and the regulator – your customer’s
representative–willtakecareofyou.”Goodbehaviorbyeachpartybegetsgoodbehaviorinreturn.

The steady and substantial comeback in the U.S. economy since mid-2009 is clear from the earnings

The four housing-related companies in this section (a group that excludes Clayton, which is carried

It’s instructive tolookatwhattranspired atourthree operating businesses after theeconomyfell offa
cliffinlate2008,becausetheirexperiencesilluminatethefracturedrecoverythatlatercamealong.
Results at our two leasing companies mirrored the “non-housing” economy. Their combined pre-tax
earningswere$13millionin2009,$53millionin2010and$155millionin2011,animprovementreflectingthe
steady recovery we have seen in almost all of our non-housing businesses. In contrast, Clayton’s world of
manufactured housing(just likesite-built housing) hasenduredaveritable depression, experiencing norecovery
to date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in
2011.(Whenhousingwasboomingin2005,theywere146,744.)
Despitethesedifficult times,Claytonhascontinuedtooperateprofitably,largelybecauseitsmortgage
portfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufactured
homes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, youmight expectustosuffer
heavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies – meaningful down
payments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income – Clayton has kept losses to
acceptablelevels.Ithasdonesoeventhoughmanyofourborrowershavehadnegativeequityforsometime.
As is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,
and for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructive
behavior – government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly was
the almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dips
would be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housing
transactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to “monetize” the increased value of their homes by
refinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemed
great fun while it lasted. (A largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have “lost” their house through
foreclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash in
excessoftheircost.Inthesecases,theevictedhomeownerwasthewinner,andthevictimwasthelender.)
15
In2007,thebubbleburst,justasallbubblesmust.Wearenowinthefourthyearofacurethat,though
longandpainful,issuretosucceed.Today,householdformationsareconsistentlyexceedinghousingstarts.
Clayton’s earnings should improve materially when the nation’s excess housing inventory is worked
off. As I see things today, however, I believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does not
differmateriallyfromtheirbookvalue.

The banking industry is back on its feet, and Wells Fargo is prospering. Its earnings are strong, its
assets solid and its capital at record levels. At Bank of America, some huge mistakes were made by prior
management. Brian Moynihan has made excellent progress in cleaning these up, though the completion of that
process willtakeanumberofyears.Concurrently, heisnurturingahugeandattractive underlyingbusinessthat

however, must be noted: Though our existing contracts have very minor collateral requirements, the rules have

TheBasicChoicesforInvestorsandtheOneWeStronglyPrefer

moremoneyinthefuture.AtBerkshirewetakeamoredemandingapproach,defininginvestingasthetransferto

Investment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it’s
importanttounderstandthecharacteristicsofeach.Solet’ssurveythefield.
• Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages,
bankdeposits,andotherinstruments.Mostofthesecurrency-basedinvestmentsarethoughtofas“safe.”

from bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers would

For tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-year
period,continuousrollingofU.S.Treasurybillsproduced5.7%annually.Thatsoundssatisfactory.But
if an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return would

Highinterestrates,ofcourse,cancompensatepurchasersfortheinflationrisktheyfacewithcurrency-based
investments–andindeed,ratesintheearly1980sdidthatjobnicely.Currentrates,however,donotcome
close to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume. Right now bonds should come with a
warninglabel.
Undertoday’sconditions,therefore,Idonotlikecurrency-basedinvestments.Evenso,Berkshireholds
significant amounts of them, primarily of the short-term variety. At Berkshire the need for ample
liquidity occupies center stage and will never be slighted, however inadequate rates may be.
Accommodating this need, we primarily hold U.S. Treasury bills, the only investment that can be
countedonforliquidityunderthemostchaoticofeconomicconditions.Ourworkinglevelforliquidity
is$20billion;$10billionisourabsoluteminimum.
Beyondtherequirements thatliquidityandregulators imposeonus,wewillpurchasecurrency-related
securities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain – either because a particular credit is
mispriced, as can occur in periodic junk-bond debacles, or because rates rise to a level that offers the
possibility of realizing substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates fall. Though we’ve
exploitedbothopportunitiesinthepast–andmaydosoagain–wearenow180degreesremovedfrom
such prospects. Today, a wry comment that Wall Streeter Shelby Cullom Davis made long ago seems
apt:“Bondspromotedasofferingrisk-freereturnsarenowpricedtodeliverreturn-freerisk.”
• Thesecondmajorcategoryofinvestmentsinvolvesassetsthatwillneverproduceanything,butthatare
purchased in the buyer’s hope that someone else – who also knows that the assets will be forever
unproductive – will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of
suchbuyersinthe17thcentury.
This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they
believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can
produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more
avidlyinthefuture.
Themajorassetinthiscategoryisgold,currentlyahugefavoriteofinvestorswhofearalmostallother
assets, especially paper money (of whosevalue, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold,however,
has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some
industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of
soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still
ownoneounceatitsend.
What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow.During the
past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated
additionalbuyingenthusiasm,attractingpurchaserswhoseetheriseasvalidatinganinvestmentthesis.
As“bandwagon”investorsjoinanyparty,theycreatetheirowntruth–forawhile.
Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses

Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it
wouldformacubeofabout68feetperside.(Pictureitfittingcomfortablywithinabaseballinfield.)At
$1,750perounce–gold’spriceasIwritethis–itsvaluewouldbe$9.6trillion.CallthiscubepileA.
Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400
million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most
profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would
have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying
binge).Canyouimagineaninvestorwith$9.6trillionselectingpileAoverpileB?
Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual
production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users,
frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely
maintainanequilibriumatpresentprices.
Acenturyfromnowthe400millionacresoffarmlandwillhaveproducedstaggeringamountsofcorn,
wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the
currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its
owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The
170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can
fondlethecube,butitwillnotrespond.
Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m
confident,however,thatthe$9.6trillioncurrentvaluationofpileAwillcompoundoverthecenturyat
aratefarinferiortothatachievedbypileB.
• Our first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: Terror over economic collapse
drives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currency
collapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard “cash is king” in late 2008, just
whencashshouldhavebeendeployedratherthanheld.Similarly,weheard“cashistrash”intheearly
1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On those
occasions,investorswhorequiredasupportivecrowdpaiddearlyforthatcomfort.
My ownpreference –and you knewthiswascoming–isourthird category: investment inproductive
assets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability in
inflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a
minimum ofnewcapital investment. Farms,realestate,andmanybusinessessuchasCoca-Cola,IBM
and our own See’s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies – think of our
regulatedutilities,forexample–failitbecauseinflationplacesheavycapitalrequirementsonthem.To
earn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior to
nonproductiveorcurrency-basedassets.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we
will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year the store did $32.7 million of business
during its annual meeting sale, a volume that exceeds the yearly sales of most furniture stores. To obtain the
Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, May 1st and Monday, May 7th inclusive,
and also present your meeting credential. Theperiod’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several
prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of
our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open

9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 2 p.m., I will be clerking at
Borsheims, desperate to beat my sales figure from last year. So come take advantage of me. Ask me for my

We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,
shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30th through Saturday, May 12th. During that period,
please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that
