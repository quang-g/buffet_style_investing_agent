Notes: Data are for calendar years with these exceptions: 1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended
12/31. Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at
market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s

Š When the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965, I could never have dreamed that a year in
whichwehadagainof$24.1billionwouldbesubpar,intermsofthecomparisonwepresentonthefacing

But subpar it was. For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire’s percentage increase in book value was less
than the S&P’s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). In
eight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&Phad a gain of 15% or more. We dobetter whenthe

Todate,we’veneverhadafive-yearperiodofunderperformance,havingmanaged43timestosurpassthe

four years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-
yearwinswillend.
One thing of which you can be certain: Whatever Berkshire’s results, my partner Charlie Munger, the
company’s Vice Chairman, and I will not change yardsticks. It’s our job to increase intrinsic business

We couldn’t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinary
manager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holding
company. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend. The preferred
has two other features that materially increase its value: at some point it will be redeemed at a significant
premium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holding
company’scommonstockforanominalsum.

Ofthisgroup,onlyMidAmerican,thenearning$393millionpre-tax,wasownedbyBerkshireeightyears

BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased the

Š Berkshire’s yearend employment totaled a record 288,462 (see page 106 for details), up 17,604 from last
year.Ourheadquarterscrew,however,remainedunchangedat24.Nosensegoingcrazy.
Š Berkshire’s“BigFour”investments–AmericanExpress,Coca-Cola,IBMandWellsFargo–allhadgood
years. Our ownership interest in each of these companies increased during the year. We purchased
additionalsharesofWellsFargo(ourownershipnowis8.7%versus7.6%atyearend2011)andIBM(6.0%
versus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage
ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.8% to 8.9% and our interest at American Express from
13.0%to13.7%.
Berkshire’s ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future. Mae West had it
right:“Toomuchofagoodthingcanbewonderful.”
The four companies possess marvelous businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and
shareholder-oriented. At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a
wonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business. Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us a
significantadvantageovercompaniesthatlimitthemselvesonlytoacquisitionstheycanoperate.
Goingbyouryearendsharecount,ourportionofthe“BigFour’s”2012earningsamountedto$3.9billion.

The earnings that the four companies retain are often used for repurchases – which enhance our share of

expect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. If we are correct, dividends to Berkshire
will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains (which, for the four, totaled

Š There was alotofhand-wringinglastyearamongCEOswhocried“uncertainty”whenfacedwithcapital-
allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings and
cash). At Berkshire, we didn’t share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant and
equipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That’s 19% more than we spent in 2011, our
previous high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits are

IntrinsicBusinessValue
AsmuchasCharlieandItalkaboutintrinsicbusinessvalue,wecannottellyoupreciselywhatthatnumber
is for Berkshire shares (or, for that matter, any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the
three elements – one of which was qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’s
intrinsicvalue.Thatdiscussionisreproducedinfullonpages104-105.
Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2012 our per-share investments increased 15.7% to
$113,786, and our per-share pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments also increased
15.7%to$8,085.
Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.4% compounded annually, and our
per-share earnings figure has grownata20.8%clip.Itisnocoincidence thattheprice ofBerkshire stockoverthe
42-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see

Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and
income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll present them
asfourseparatebusinesses,whichishowCharlieandIviewthem.

Insurance
Let’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion
overtheyears.
Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such
as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-
now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others.
Meanwhile,wegettoinvestthisfloatforBerkshire’sbenefit.Thoughindividualpoliciesandclaimscomeandgo,
the amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business
grows,sodoesourfloat.Andhowwehavegrown,asthefollowingtableshows:

National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts
downward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual – at the outside no
morethan2%inanyyear.
If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit
thataddstotheinvestmentincomeourfloatproduces.Whensuchaprofitisearned,weenjoytheuseoffreemoney
–and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit.That’slikeyourtakingoutaloanandhavingthebankpayyouinterest.
Unfortunately,thewishofallinsurerstoachievethishappyresultcreatesintensecompetition,sovigorous
in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in
effect,iswhattheindustrypaystoholditsfloat.Forexample,StateFarm,byfarthecountry’slargestinsureranda
well-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Their
financialsfor2012arenotyetavailable.)Therearealotofwaystolosemoneyininsurance,andtheindustrynever
ceasessearchingfornewones.
As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten
consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will
continuetounderwriteprofitablyinmostyears.Ifwedo,ourfloatwillbebetterthanfreemoney.
So how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is
calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were
unable to replenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving
fund.Iffloatisbothcostlessandlong-enduring,whichIbelieveBerkshire’swillbe,thetruevalueofthisliabilityis
dramaticallylessthantheaccountingliability.
Apartialoffsettothisoverstatedliabilityis$15.5billionof“goodwill”thatisattributabletoourinsurance
companiesandincludedinbookvalueasanasset.Ineffect,thisgoodwillrepresentsthepricewepaidforthefloat-
generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true
value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset
carriedonthebooksshouldbedeemedvalueless,whateveritsoriginalcost.

Fortunately,that’snotthecaseatBerkshire.CharlieandIbelievethetrueeconomicvalueofourinsurance
goodwill–whatwewouldhappilypaytopurchaseaninsuranceoperationproducingfloatofsimilarquality–tobe

2011, the industry’s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry’s
overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by American
industry,asorryperformancealmostcertaintocontinue.
A further unpleasant reality adds to the industry’s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefitting
from “legacy” bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvested
duringthenextfewyears–andperhapsformanyyearsbeyondthat.Today’sbondportfoliosare,ineffect,wasting

one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most
important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are
inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large
insurers.Forexample,iftheinsuranceindustryshouldexperiencea$250billionlossfromsomemega-catastrophe

causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both

I rub my eyes when I look at what Tony has accomplished. Last year, it should be noted, his record was
considerably better thanisindicated byGEICO’sGAAPunderwriting profit of$680million.Becauseofachange
in accounting rules at the beginning of the year, we recorded a charge to GEICO’s underwriting earnings of
$410million.Thisitemhadnothingtodowith2012’soperatingresults,changingneithercash,revenues,expenses
nor taxes. In effect, the writedown simply widened the already huge difference between GEICO’s intrinsic value
andthevalueatwhichwecarryitonourbooks.
GEICO earned its underwriting profit, moreover, despite the company suffering its largest single loss in
history. The cause was Hurricane Sandy, which cost GEICO more than three times the loss it sustained from
Katrina, the previous record-holder. We insured 46,906 vehicles that were destroyed or damaged in the storm, a
staggeringnumberreflectingGEICO’sleadingmarketshareintheNewYorkmetropolitanarea.
Last year GEICO enjoyed a meaningful increase in both the renewal rate for existing policyholders
(“persistency”) and in the percentage of rate quotations that resulted in sales (“closures”). Big dollars ride on those
two factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than
$1 billion. GEICO’s gains in 2012 offer dramatic proof that when people check the company’s prices, they usually

A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with
these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact
not needed because each business has earning power that even under terrible conditions amply covers its interest
requirements. In last year’s tepid economy, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was 9.6x. (Our definition of
coverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as deeply flawed.)
At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances: the
company’srecession-resistantearnings,whichresultfromourexclusivelyofferinganessentialservice,anditsgreat

Sharp-eyed readers willnotice anincongruityintheMidAmerican earningstabulation. Whatintheworld
is HomeServices, a real estate brokerage operation, doing in a section entitled “Regulated, Capital-Intensive
Businesses?”
Well, its ownership came with MidAmerican when we bought control of that company in 2000. At that
time, I focused on MidAmerican’s utility operations and barely noticed HomeServices, which then owned only a
fewrealestatebrokeragecompanies.
Since then, however, the company has regularly added residential brokers – three in 2012 – and now has
about 16,000 agents in a string of major U.S. cities. (Our real estate brokerage companies are listed on page 107.)

Our income and expense data conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) is on
page 29. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude some
purchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in this
mannerbecauseCharlieandIbelievetheadjustednumbersmoreaccuratelyreflecttherealexpensesandprofitsof
thebusinessesaggregatedinthetable.
I won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are small and arcane – but serious investors should
understand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value.
With software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as
theamortizationofcustomerrelationships,however,arisethroughpurchase-accountingrulesandareclearlynotreal
expenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as
expenseswhencalculatingearnings–eventhoughfromaninvestor’sviewpointtheycouldnotbemoredifferent.

that is the portion we have included in the table above – and the rest not. This difference has become significant
becauseofthemanyacquisitionswehavemade.

The crowd of companies in this section sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the
businesses enjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25%
after-tax to more than 100%. Others produce goodreturns in the area of 12-20%.Afew,however,haveverypoor

More than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price
than to buy a fair business at a wonderful price. Despite the compelling logic of his position, I have sometimes

Viewed as a single entity, therefore, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employ

Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the price paid is excessive. We

WeBuySomeNewspapers...Newspapers?
During the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This may
puzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that the
circulation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certain to decline. That prediction still
holds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our oft-stated size requirements for
acquisitions.

News,toputitsimply,iswhatpeopledon’tknowthattheywanttoknow.Andpeoplewillseektheirnews
– what’s important to them – from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access,
reliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of the
newsandthepersonwantingit.
BeforetelevisionandtheInternet,newspapersweretheprimarysourceforanincrediblevarietyofnews,a
fact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests were
international, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latest
information.Indeed,yourpapercontainedsomuchyouwantedtolearnthatyoureceivedyourmoney’sworth,even
if only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost all
oftheproduct’scost,andreadersrodetheircoattails.
Additionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effect
providing even more “news.” Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs or
apartmentswereavailable,whatsupermarketswerecarryingwhichweekendspecials,orwhatmovieswereshowing
whereandwhenwasfarmoreimportantthantheviewsexpressedontheeditorialpage.
16
In turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, they
requireda“megaphone”totellthecity’sresidentswhytheirstoresshouldbevisitedtoday.Indeed,bigdepartment
stores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods they
advertised wouldfly off the shelves. Withnoothermegaphone remotely comparable tothatofthenewspaper,ads
soldthemselves.
As long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary;
whether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, “I
owemyexaltedpositioninlifetotwogreatAmericaninstitutions–nepotismandmonopoly.”)
Over the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers that
joinedforcestooperateasasingleeconomicunit).Thiscontractionwasinevitablebecausemostpeoplewishedto
read and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulation
almostautomatically receivedthemostads.Thatleftadsdrawingreadersandreadersdrawingads.Thissymbiotic

Now the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old news
longbeforethepressesbegintoroll.TheInternetoffersextensiveinformationaboutbothavailablejobsandhomes.
Television bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another,
newspapers have therefore lost their “primacy.” And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenues
from“helpwanted”classifiedads–longahugesourceofincomefornewspapers–haveplungedmorethan90%in
thepast12years.)

about Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors will
be read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper thatserves the special informational
needsofthatcommunitywillremainindispensabletoasignificantportionofitsresidents.
Even a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. Andthat process has
been underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers – including Berkshire in Buffalo –
haveofferedtheirpaperfreeontheInternetwhilechargingmeaningfulsumsforthephysicalspecimen.Howcould
this lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation,
moreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the “virtuous circle” of the past
reverses.
The Wall Street Journal went to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is the
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and over
the past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. Despite
Walter’s powerful example, it’s only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire’s, have
exploredpayarrangements.Whateverworksbest–andtheanswerisnotyetclear–willbecopiedwidely.
************
Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound
communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that
success will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage
will almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in some
large towns or cities – while it may improve profits in the short term – seems certain to diminish the papers’
relevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paid
appropriatelybythosewhofindususeful,whethertheproducttheyviewisintheirhandsorontheInternet.
17
Our confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger’s outstanding management group at the
Omaha World-Herald, a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers,
however, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailies

Our newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward.

Dividends
AnumberofBerkshireshareholders–includingsomeofmygoodfriends–wouldlikeBerkshiretopaya

butpayoutnothingourselves.Solet’sexaminewhendividendsdoanddon’tmakesenseforshareholders.
A profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). A
company’smanagementshouldfirstexaminereinvestmentpossibilitiesofferedbyitscurrentbusiness–projectsto
become more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economic
moatseparatingthecompanyfromitscompetitors.
Iaskthemanagers ofoursubsidiaries tounendingly focusonmoat-widening opportunities, andtheyfind
manythatmakeeconomic sense.Butsometimes ourmanagers misfire. Theusualcauseoffailure isthattheystart
with the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process is
subconscious;that’swhatmakesitsodangerous.
Your chairman has not been free of this sin. In Berkshire’s 1986 annual report, I described how twenty
yearsofmanagement effortandcapitalimprovements inouroriginaltextilebusinesswereanexerciseinfutility. I
wanted the business to succeed and wished my way into a series of bad decisions. (I even bought another New
Englandtextilecompany.)ButwishingmakesdreamscometrueonlyinDisneymovies;it’spoisoninbusiness.
Despite such past miscues, our first priority with available funds will always be to examine whether they
canbeintelligentlydeployedinourvariousbusinesses.Ourrecord$12.1billionoffixed-assetinvestmentsandbolt-
on acquisitions in 2012 demonstrate that this is a fertile field for capital allocation at Berkshire. And here we have
anadvantage:Becauseweoperateinsomanyareasoftheeconomy,weenjoyarangeofchoicesfarwiderthanthat
opentomostcorporations.Indecidingwhattodo,wecanwatertheflowersandskipovertheweeds.
Evenafterwedeployheftyamountsofcapitalinourcurrentoperations,Berkshirewillregularlygeneratea
lot of additional cash. Our next step, therefore, is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses.
Here our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholders
wealthieronaper-sharebasisthantheywerepriortotheacquisition?
I have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record is
satisfactory,whichmeansthatourshareholdersarefarwealthiertodaythantheywouldbeifthefundsweusedfor
acquisitionshadinsteadbeendevotedtosharerepurchasesordividends.
But, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is noguarantee of future results. That’s particularly
true at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is now
moredifficultthanithasbeenduringmostofouryears.
Nevertheless,alargedealstilloffersuspossibilitiestoaddmateriallytoper-shareintrinsicvalue.BNSFis
a case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the funds
required for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though large
transactionsoftheBNSFkindwillberare,therearestillsomewhalesintheocean.
The third use of funds – repurchases – is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful
discount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds
intelligently: It’s hard to go wrong when you’re buying dollar bills for 80¢ or less. We explained our criteria for
repurchases in last year’s report and, if the opportunity presents itself,we will buylarge quantities of our stock.We
originally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, we
increasedthelimitto120%inDecemberwhenalargeblockbecameavailableatabout116%ofbookvalue.
19
But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are
madeaboveintrinsic value.Thedirectors andIbelievethatcontinuingshareholdersarebenefittedinameaningful
waybypurchasesuptoour120%limit.
And that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The
numberswillrequirecarefulreading,buttheyareessentialtounderstandingthecaseforandagainstdividends.So
bearwithme.
We’llstartbyassumingthatyouandIaretheequalownersofabusinesswith$2millionofnetworth.The
business earns 12% on tangible net worth – $240,000 – and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% on
reinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of net
worth.Therefore,thevalueofwhatweeachownisnow$1.25million.
Youwouldliketohavethetwoofusshareholdersreceiveone-thirdofourcompany’sannualearningsand
have two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income and
capital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase the
futureearningsofthebusiness.Inthefirstyear,yourdividendwouldbe$40,000,andasearningsgrewandtheone-
third payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8%
eachyear(12%earnedonnetworthless4%ofnetworthpaidout).
Aftertenyearsourcompanywouldhaveanetworthof$4,317,850(theoriginal$2millioncompoundedat
8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656
(125% of our half of the company’s net worth). And we would live happily ever after – with dividends and the
valueofourstockcontinuingtogrowat8%annually.
There is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, we
wouldleaveallearningsinthecompanyandeachsell3.2%ofoursharesannually.Sincetheshareswouldbesold
at 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would grow
annually.Callthisoptionthe“sell-off”approach.
Under this “sell-off” scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years
($2millioncompoundedat12%).Becausewewouldbesellingshareseachyear,ourpercentageownershipwould
have declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the net
worth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable to
eachofuscanbesoldfor$1.25.Therefore,themarketvalueofyourremainingshareswouldbe$2,804,425,about
4%greaterthanthevalueofyoursharesifwehadfollowedthedividendapproach.
Moreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than you
would have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! – you would have both more cash to spend annually and
morecapitalvalue.
Thiscalculation,ofcourse,assumesthatourhypotheticalcompanycanearnanaverageof12%annuallyon
net worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, the
S&P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth.
BothassumptionsalsoseemreasonableforBerkshire,thoughcertainlynotassured.
Moreover,ontheplusside,therealsoisapossibilitythattheassumptionswillbeexceeded.Iftheyare,the
argumentforthesell-offpolicybecomesevenstronger.OverBerkshire’shistory–admittedlyonethatwon’tcome
close to being repeated –the sell-off policywouldhaveproducedresults forshareholders dramatically superior to
thedividendpolicy.
Aside from the favorable math, there are two further – and important – arguments for a sell-off policy.
First,dividendsimposeaspecificcash-outpolicyuponallshareholders.If,say,40%ofearningsisthepolicy,those
whowish30%or50%willbethwarted.Our600,000shareholderscoverthewaterfrontintheirdesiresforcash.It
is safe to say, however, that a great many of them – perhaps even most of them – are in a net-savings mode and
logicallyshouldprefernopaymentatall.
20
Thesell-offalternative,ontheotherhand,letseachshareholdermakehisownchoicebetweencashreceipts
and capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholders
elect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder inour dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use his
dividendstopurchasemoreshares.Buthewouldtakeabeatingindoingso:Hewouldbothincurtaxesandalsopay
a 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take place
at125%ofbookvalue.)
The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all
taxpaying shareholders areinferior –usually farinferior –tothoseunderthesell-off program.Underthedividend
program, all of the cash received byshareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax on
onlythegainportionofthecashreceipts.
Let me endthis math exercise – andI canhear youcheering as I put awaythe dentist drill – by usingmy
own case to illustrate how a shareholder’s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased
investmentinhisorherbusiness.Forthelastsevenyears,Ihaveannuallygivenawayabout41⁄ 4%ofmyBerkshire
shares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) has
decreasedto528,525,623shares.Clearlymyownershippercentageofthecompanyhassignificantlydecreased.
Yet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in
Berkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figures
are $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have far more money working for me
at Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It’s also true that my share of
bothBerkshire’sintrinsicbusinessvalueandthecompany’snormalearningpowerisfargreaterthanitwasin2005.
Over time, I expect this accretion of value to continue – albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion – even as I now
annually give away more than 41⁄ 2% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I’ve recently doubled my
lifetimepledgestocertainfoundations).
