BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC.
TotheShareholdersofBerkshireHathawayInc.:
Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value of
both our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51years (that is, since present management took over),
per-sharebookvaluehasgrownfrom$19to$155,501,arateof19.2%compoundedannually.*
During the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really
counts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our
resourcesweredeployedinmarketablesecuritiesthatwereregularlyrevaluedtotheirquotedprices(lessthetaxthat
would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part
“markedtomarket.”
By the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that
diminishedtherelevanceofbalance-sheetfigures.Thatdisconnectoccurredbecausetheaccountingrulesthatapply

economic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire’s book value. We’ve

Over time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gap
betweenintrinsicvalueandbookvalue.Today,thelarge–andgrowing–unrecordedgainsatour“winners”makeit

TheYearatBerkshire
Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized earning
powertoincreaseeveryyear.(Actualyear-to-yearearnings,ofcourse,willsometimesdeclinebecauseofweakness
intheU.S.economyor,possibly,becauseofinsurancemega-catastrophes.)Insomeyearsthenormalizedgainswill
besmall;atothertimestheywillbematerial.Lastyearwasagoodone.Herearethehighlights:
‹ The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to better
earnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service to
customers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capital
expenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annual
depreciationcharge.Itwasmoneywellspent.
BNSF moves about 17% of America’s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whether
transported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among the
sevenlargeAmericanrailroads(twoofwhichareCanadian-based),carrying45%moreton-milesoffreight
than our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to our
shippers’welfarebutalsoimportanttothesmoothfunctioningoftheU.S.economy.
For most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earnings
weakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion*
(a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks and
deserveyours.
‹ BNSF is the largest of our “Powerhouse Five,” a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy,
Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies – our five most profitable non-insurance
businesses–earned$13.1billionin2015,anincreaseof$650millionover2014.
Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003.
Subsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, we
paid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the
numberoutstandingby6.1%.Inotherwords,the$12.7billiongaininannualearningsdeliveredBerkshire
by the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That
satisfiesourgoalofnotsimplyincreasingearnings,butmakingsurewealsoincreaseper-shareresults.
‹ Next year, I will be discussing the “Powerhouse Six.” The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp.
(“PCC”), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectly

A personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance of

JorgePauloandhisassociatescouldnotbebetterpartners.Wesharewiththemapassiontobuy,buildand

thisgoal.
Their method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer an
opportunityforeliminatingmanyunnecessarycostsandthen–verypromptly–tomakethemovesthatwill
get the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America’s
economic growthoverthepast240years.Withoutmoreoutputofdesiredgoodsandservicesperworking
hour – that’s the measure of productivity gains – an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporate
America,trulymajorgainsinproductivityarepossible,afactofferingopportunitiestoJorgePauloandhis
associates.
At Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow
an approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by
cost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, our role is simply to create an environment in
which these CEOs – and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded – can maximize both
theirmanagerialeffectivenessandthepleasuretheyderivefromtheirjobs.(Withthishands-offstyle,Iam
heeding a well-known Mungerism: “If you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure to

Wewillcontinue tooperate withextreme –indeed,almostunheardof–decentralization atBerkshire.But
we will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was the
case whenhis group purchased Tim Horton’s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz.
Wealsomayoccasionallypartnerwithothers,aswehavesuccessfullydoneatBerkadia.
Berkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostile
offersarejustified:SomeCEOsforgetthatitisshareholdersforwhomtheyshouldbeworking,whileother
managers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant to

‹ Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – American
Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our
ownershipto8.4%versus7.8%atyearend2014)andWellsFargo(goingto9.8%from9.4%).Attheother
twocompanies,Coca-ColaandAmericanExpress,stockrepurchasesraisedourpercentageownership.Our
equityinCoca-Colagrewfrom9.2%to9.3%,andourinterestinAmericanExpressincreasedfrom14.8%
to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren’t important, consider this math: For the
four companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire’s
portionoftheirannualearningsbyabout$500million.
These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and
shareholder-oriented. Theirreturnsontangibleequityrangefromexcellenttostaggering.AtBerkshire,we
muchprefer owninganon-controlling butsubstantial portion ofawonderful companytoowning100%of

If Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2015 earnings
amounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends they
pay us – about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies’
earningswedon’treportareeverybitasvaluabletousastheportionBerkshirerecords.
Theearningsourinvesteesretainareoftenusedforrepurchasesoftheirownstock–amovethatincreases
Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Theretained earnings of these
companies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to
expectthattheper-shareearningsofthesefourinvestees,inaggregate,willgrowsubstantiallyovertime.If
gains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capital
gains.
Our flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled
businesses – gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they will
operate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chance
offindingadateonSaturdaynight.Inlikemanner–well,notexactlylikemanner–ourappetiteforeither
operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire’s
endless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpile

It’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course,
onlytheycansolve).Asaresultofthisnegativedrumbeat,manyAmericansnowbelievethattheirchildrenwillnot

Thatviewisdeadwrong:ThebabiesbeingborninAmericatodayaretheluckiestcropinhistory.

Some commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP–and, yes, wewouldall like to

America’s population is growing about .8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and .3% from net
migration). Thus2%ofoverall growthproducesabout1.2%ofpercapitagrowth.Thatmaynotsoundimpressive.
But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in real GDP per capita.
(Compounding’seffectsproducetheexcessoverthepercentagethatwouldresultbysimplymultiplying25x1.2%.)
Inturn,that34.4%gainwillproduceastaggering$19,000increaseinrealGDPpercapitaforthenextgeneration.
Were that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today’s politicians
neednotshedtearsfortomorrow’schildren.
Indeed, most of today’s children are doing well. All families in my upper middle-class neighborhood
regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth. His
unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is – to name just a few –
transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he
couldnot,however,liveaswellasmyneighborsnowdo.
Though the pie to be shared by the next generation will be far larger than today’s, how it will be divided
will remain fiercely contentious. Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goods
and services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm,
betweentheinheritorsandtheHoratioAlgers,betweeninvestorsandworkersand,inparticular,betweenthosewith
talentsthatarevaluedhighlybythemarketplaceandtheequallydecenthard-workingAmericanswholacktheskills
the market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us – and will forever continue. Congress will be the
battlefield;moneyandvoteswillbetheweapons.Lobbyingwillremainagrowthindustry.
The good news, however, is that even members of the “losing” sides will almost certainly enjoy –as they
should –farmoregoodsandservices inthefuture thantheyhaveinthepast.Thequality oftheir increased bounty
will also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want – nor, even more
so, in delivering what people don’t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a television
set, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do,
quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter,
“search”isinvaluabletome.(I’mnotreadyforTinder,however.)
For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America’s
golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social security
promises willbehonoredandperhaps mademoregenerous. And,yes,America’s kidswilllivefarbetter thantheir

Considering thisfavorable tailwind, Berkshire (and,tobesure,agreat manyotherbusinesses) willalmost
certainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by
following our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries;
(2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees;
(4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and
(5)makinganoccasionallargeacquisition.Managementwillalsotrytomaximizeresultsforyoubyrarely,ifever,

IntrinsicBusinessValue
AsmuchasCharlieandItalkaboutintrinsicbusinessvalue,wecannottellyoupreciselywhatthatnumber
isforBerkshireshares(nor,infact,foranyotherstock).Itispossible,however,tomakeasensibleestimate.Inour
2010 annual report we laid out the three elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to an
estimationofBerkshire’sintrinsicvalue.Thatdiscussionisreproducedinfullonpages113-114.
Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased
8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses –
including insurance underwriting income – increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor
the dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-counting
of value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortization
andminorityinterests.Incometaxes,though,arenotdeducted.Thatis,theearningsarepre-tax.
Iusedtheitalicsintheparagraphabovebecauseweareforthefirsttimeincludinginsuranceunderwriting
incomeinbusinessearnings.WedidnotdothatwhenweinitiallyintroducedBerkshire’stwoquantitativepillarsof
valuation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn’t
blow and the earth didn’t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe wouldproduce red ink. In order to
be conservative then in stating our business earnings, weconsistently assumed that underwriting wouldbreak even
overtimeandignoredanyofitsgainsorlossesinourannualcalculationofthesecondfactorofvalue.
Today,ourinsuranceresultsarelikelytobemorestablethanwasthecaseadecadeortwoagobecausewe
have deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year,
ourunderwritingincomecontributed$1,118persharetothe$12,304pershareofearningsreferencedinthesecond

anticipatebeingprofitableinmostyears.Youshouldrecognize,however,thatunderwritinginanygivenyearcould

Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our
earnings(includingtheunderwritingresultsinboththeinitialandterminalyear)havegrownata23.7%clip.Itisno
coincidencethatthepriceofBerkshirestockovertheensuing45yearshasincreasedatarateverysimilartothatof
our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operating
earnings.

Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and
incomecharacteristics fromtheothers.Sowe’llpresentthemasfourseparatebusinesses,whichishowCharlieand

Insurance
Let’slookfirstatinsurance.Theproperty-casualty(“P/C”)branchofthatindustryhasbeentheenginethat
has propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National
Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world,
as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is far in excess of the value at which it is carried on our
books.

One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive
premiumsupfrontandpayclaimslater.Inextremecases,suchasthosearisingfromcertainworkers’compensation
accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies
holdinglargesums–moneywecall“float”–thatwilleventuallygotoothers.Meanwhile,insurersgettoinvestthis

Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specialized

never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This
structure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire’s economic fortress. It will never be
compromised.
If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit

Unfortunately,thewishofallinsurerstoachievethishappyresultcreatesintensecompetition,sovigorous
indeed that it sometimes causes the P/Cindustry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.This loss,
in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance
industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal
returnsontangiblenetworthascomparedtootherAmericanbusinesses.Theprolongedperiodoflowinterestrates
the world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings onfloat will steadily decrease for many years
to come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It’s agoodbetthatindustry results overthenextten
years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize in
reinsurance.
As noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive

If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this
liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –

Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our
insurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance
operationpossessingit–tobefarinexcessofitshistoriccarryingvalue.Indeed,almosttheentire$15.5billionwe
carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our
float. Its value today is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value
substantiallyexceedsitsbookvalue.
************
Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running
disciplinedoperationsthatpossesshard-to-replicatebusinessmodels.Letmetellyouaboutthemajorunits.
First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks
that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,
most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that
areinappropriateinrelationtoourresources.
Indeed, Berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the
insuranceindustryshouldexperiencea$250billionlossfromsomemega-catastrophe –alossabouttripleanything
it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its
many streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to write
business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers
wouldbeswimminginredink,ifnotfacinginsolvency.
When Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the
insurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our
reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions of
valueforBerkshireshareholders.

At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all
exposuresthatmightcauseapolicytoincurlosses;(2)conservativelyassessthelikelihoodofanyexposureactually
causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both
prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate
premiumcan’tbeobtained.

Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge
float has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.
We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown

Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony

GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after

In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies that primarily
write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation that
consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed,
over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting – about 13% of its premium volume –

Regulated,Capital-IntensiveBusinesses
We have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing them
fromourotherbusinesses.Consequently,weassignthemtheirownsectioninthisletterandsplitouttheircombined
financialstatistics inourGAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement.Together,theylastyearaccountedfor37%of
Berkshire’safter-taxoperatingearnings.
A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with
these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact
notneededbecauseeachcompanyhasearningpowerthatevenunderterribleeconomicconditionswouldfarexceed

At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.
The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an
essential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-widening
diversityofearningsstreams,whichshieldBHEfrombeingseriouslyharmedbyanysingleregulatorybody.These

AtBNSF,price comparisons betweenmajorrailroads arefarmoredifficult tomakebecauseofsignificant
differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a very crude measure,
however,ourrevenue perton-mile wasjustunder3¢last year,whileshippingcostsforcustomers oftheotherfour

Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no
state comes close to Iowa, where last year megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 47% of all
megawatt-hours sold to our retail customers. (Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take that
figureto58%in2017.)
BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost
500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highway
congestion–andthetaxpayer-fundedmaintenanceexpendituresthatcomewithheaviertraffic–inamajorway.

*Earnings for 2013 have been restated to exclude Marmon’s leasing operations, which are now included in the
FinanceandFinancialProductsresults.
Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 38. In contrast, the operating expense
figures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of
certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers
more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do
GAAPfigures.
Iwon’texplainalloftheadjustments–somearetinyandarcane–butseriousinvestorsshouldunderstand
the disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no way lose value.
For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recording
charges against otherintangibles, suchascustomer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rulesandclearly
does not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both,
that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though, from an investor’s viewpoint, they
couldnotdiffermore.
15
In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have been
deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non-
existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real
amortizationchargesarelikelytoclimbfurtherasweacquiremorecompanies.
Thetableonpage55givesyouthecurrentstatusofourintangibleassetsascalculatedbyGAAP.Wenow
have $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years.
Eventually, of course, every dollar of these “assets” will be charged off. When that happens, reported earnings
increaseeveniftrueearningsareflat.(Mygifttomysuccessor.)
I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I do
that,knowingthatithasbecomecommonformanagerstotelltheirownerstoignorecertainexpenseitemsthatare
alltooreal.“Stock-basedcompensation”isthemostegregiousexample.Theverynamesaysitall:“compensation.”
If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation of
earnings,whereintheworlddotheybelong?
Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring
“earnings” figures fed them bymanagements. Maybe the offending analysts don’t knowany better. Ormaybethey
fear losing “access” to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is
playing the game, why shouldn’t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of
propagatingmisleadingnumbersthatcandeceiveinvestors.

Let’s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products ranging
from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible
assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others
generategoodreturnsintheareaof12%to20%.
A few, however – these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation – have very poor
returns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the
industry in which it operates, and weare nowpaying the price for my misjudgments. Atother times, I stumbled in

FinanceandFinancialProducts
Our three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and
Marmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies are
industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. At
each of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that’s
paidoff.DealingfromstrengthisoneofBerkshire’senduringadvantages.
Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largest
homebuilderinAmerica.Lastyear,thecompanysold34,397homes,about45%ofthemanufacturedhomesbought

Manufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-income
citizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton’s
homesaresoldthroughthe331storesweourselvesownandoperate.MostofClayton’sremainingsalesaremadeto

Key to Clayton’s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all
mortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, with
the balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market only
thehomesofourcompetitors.
Lenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire’s backing, however, Clayton steadfastly
financed home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used precious
capitaltofinancedealerswhodidnotsellourhomes.ThefundswesuppliedtoGoldmanSachsandGeneralElectric
at that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownership

Our retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers of
alternative sources for financing –most of it comingfrom local banks–andalwayssecure acknowledgments from
customers that this information has been received and read. (The form we use is reproduced in its actual size on
page119.)

Mortgage-origination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society. There is no
question that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008,
which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corrupt
pattern of mortgage creation flourished whereby (1) an originator in, say, California would make loans and
(2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package many
mortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold to
unwittinginstitutionsaroundtheworld.
As if these sins weren’t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimes
concoctedasecondlayerofsliced-upfinancingwhosevaluedependedonthejunkierportionsofprimaryofferings.
(When Wall Street gets “innovative,” watch out!) While that wasgoing on,I described this “doubling-up” practice
as requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single security
beingoffered.
Both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by
volume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applications
whilemortgage originators lookedtheotherway.Naturally, thegamiest credits generated themostprofits.Smooth
Wall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable to
understand. (It’s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the more
complexstructures.Butratethemtheydid.)
BarneyFrank,perhapsthemostfinancially-savvy memberofCongressduringthepanic,recentlyassessed

AtClayton,ourrisk retention was,andis,100%.Whenweoriginate amortgage wekeepit(leaving aside

Normally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at
Clayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however,
we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn

ProductivityandProsperity
Earlier, I told you how our partners at Kraft Heinz root out inefficiencies, thereby increasing output per
hour of employment. That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America’s remarkable gains in living
standards since the nation’s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of “secret” is appropriate: Too few
Americansfullygraspthelinkagebetweenproductivityandprosperity.Toseethatconnection,let’slookfirstatthe
country’smostdramaticexample–farming–andlaterexaminethreeBerkshire-specificareas.
In1900,America’scivilianworkforcenumbered28million.Ofthese,11million,astaggering40%ofthe
total, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to its
productionandtheyieldperacrewas30bushels,foratotaloutputof2.7billionbushelsannually.
Then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity
as planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn.
Productivity,however,hasimprovedyieldstomorethan150bushelsperacre,foranannualoutputof13-14billion
bushels.Farmershavemadesimilargainswithotherproducts.
Increased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have been
accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (“human input”). Today about three million
people work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods have
allowedtensofmillionsofpresent-dayworkerstoutilizetheirtimeandtalentsinotherendeavors,areallocationof
human resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services they

It’s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural
innovations havebeen–notjustforfarmers but,morebroadly,forourentiresociety.Wewouldnothaveanything

examinethisflip-sidetoproductivitygainslaterinthissection.
For the moment, however, let’s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences
forBerkshiresubsidiaries.SimilartransformationshavebeencommonplacethroughoutAmericanbusiness.
‹ In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About
1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved by
ClassIrailroadsthatyeartotaled655billion.
By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only
187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-related
employees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggering
improvement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by
55%since1947,adropsavingshippersabout$90billionannuallyincurrentdollars.
Anotherstartling statistic: Ifittookasmanypeoplenowtomovefreight asitdidin1947,wewouldneed
well over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employment
wouldraisefreightchargesbyalot;consequently,nothingclosetotoday’svolumewouldactuallymove.)

‹ A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures cars
and their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies – the kind
dealing infireinsurance.Thisagency-centric approachincludedhighcommissions andotherunderwriting
expenses that consumed about 40¢ of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver’s
seat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another when
commissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine –
exceptfortheconsumer.
AndthensomeAmericaningenuitycameintoplay:G.J.Mecherle,afarmerfromMerna,Illinois,cameup
with the idea of a captive sales force that would sell theinsurance products ofonlyasingle company.His
baby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses – moves that
permitted lower prices – and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been the
runaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner’s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with a
direct distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwriting
expensesofabout25%.
In the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (“USAA”), a mutual-like
company,waswritingautoinsuranceformilitaryofficersonadirect-to-the-customerbasis.Thismarketing
innovationrosefromaneedthatmilitarypersonnelhadtobuyinsurancethatwouldstaywiththemasthey
movedfrombasetobase.Thatwasbusinessoflittleinteresttolocalinsuranceagencies,whichwantedthe
steadyrenewalsthatcamefrompermanentresidents.
The direct distribution method of USAA,as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed byState
FarmandAllstateandthereforedeliveredanevengreaterbargaintocustomers.ThatmadeLeoandLillian
Goodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution model
beyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated Government
EmployeesInsuranceCo.(latercompressingthismouthfultoGEICO).
Their fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did
$22.6 billion, more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the second
mouse gets the cheese.) GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAA
being the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA but
spendsconsiderablymoreonadvertisingaimedatpromotinggrowth.)
With the price advantage GEICO’slowcosts allow, it’s not surprising that several yearsagothecompany
seized the number twospotinautoinsurance from Allstate. GEICOisalsogaininggroundonState Farm,
though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 – my 100th birthday – I plan to announce
thatGEICOhastakenoverthetopspot.Markyourcalendar.
GEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at the
workforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe,
however,thatthenumberwouldbeatleast60,000,acombinationofwhattheinsurerwouldneedindirect
employmentandthepersonnelrequiredatsupportingagencies.

‹ In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) operates within a changing
economic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric companydidnotdependonits efficiency. In
fact,a“sloppy”operationcoulddojustfinefinancially.
That’s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a
levelthatgavethemaprescribedreturnuponthecapitaltheyemployed.Thejokeintheindustrywasthata
utility was the only business that would automatically earn more money byredecorating the boss’s office.
AndsomeCEOsranthingsaccordingly.
That’s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is in
our country’s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makes

The safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015

In 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our

TheproductivitygainsthatI’vejustspelledout–andcountlessothersthathavebeenachievedinAmerica
– have delivered awesome benefits to society. That’s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed – and will
continuetoenjoy–majorgainsinthegoodsandservicestheyreceive.
To this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely
benefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay a
terriblepricewheninnovationornewefficienciesupendtheirworlds.
We need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of public
shareholders). It’s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from good
decisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices. Moreover, investors who
diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winning
investments have always far more than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20th Century, the Dow Jones
IndustrialAverage–anindexfundofsorts–soaredfrom66to11,497,withitscomponentcompaniesallthewhile

A long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact to
produce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decent
employmentelsewhere;forothers,thatisnotanoption.
When low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded,
putting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they could
learn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood they
couldnotreplace.Thesamescenariounfoldedinslow-motionatouroriginalNewEnglandtextileoperation,which

The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.

Thesolution,rather,isavarietyofsafetynetsaimedatprovidingadecentlifeforthosewhoarewillingto

price of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the
unfortunate.
ImportantRisks
We, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog “risk factors” in our 10-K. I
can’tremember,however,aninstancewhenreadinga10-K’s“risk”sectionhashelpedmeinevaluatingabusiness.
That’s not because the identified risks aren’t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known.
Beyond that, a 10-K’s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening event
actually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that will

None of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire’s long-term well-being. When we took over the
company in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: “The northern textile business in
which all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.” That development,
however,wasnodeathknell.Wesimplyadapted.Andwewillcontinuetodoso.
24
Every day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changing
world.Justasvigorously,CharlieandIfocusonwhereasteadystreamoffundsshouldbedeployed.Inthatrespect,
we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believe
that Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I’ve itemized above – and
manymore–andtoemergewithever-greaterearningpower.
There is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are
powerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a “successful” (as defined by the
aggressor)cyber,biological,nuclearorchemicalattackontheUnitedStates.ThatisariskBerkshireshareswithall

The probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It’s been more than 70

Nevertheless,what’sasmallprobabilityinashortperiodapproachescertaintyinthelongerrun.(Ifthereis
only one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in a
century is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps even

I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this
year’s annualmeeting. Thesponsorwouldlikeustoprovideareport onthedangersthatthischangemightpresent

danger.
Thisissuebearsasimilarity toPascal’sWagerontheExistenceofGod.Pascal,itmayberecalled,argued

foolhardy. Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how
cloudlesstheskiesappear.
It’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by
climate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that property
losseswillskyrocketbecauseofweatherchanges.Andsuchworriesmight,infact,bewarrantedifwewroteten-or

Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company’s average loss-per-policy
wasthenabout$30annually.ImagineyourreactionifIhadpredictedthenthatin2015thelosscostswouldincrease
toabout$1,000perpolicy.Wouldn’tsuchskyrocketinglossesprovedisastrous,youmightask?Well,no.
Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans
involved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So,
paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had
remainedunchanged,Berkshirewouldnowownanautoinsurerdoing$600millionofbusinessannuallyratherthan
onedoing$23billion.
Up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-
related events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years,
whichiswhywehavebackedawayfromthatbusiness.Ifsuper-catsbecomecostlierandmorefrequent,thelikely–

As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a

TheAnnualMeeting
Charlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21st Century. Our annual meeting this year will be webcast
worldwide in its entirety. To view the meeting, simply go to https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream at 9 a.m.
Central Daylight Time on Saturday, April 30th. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews with
managers,directorsandshareholders.Then,at9:30,CharlieandIwillcommenceansweringquestions.
This new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance at
themeeting.Lastyear’srecordofmorethan40,000attendeesstrainedourcapacity.Inadditiontoquicklyfillingthe
CenturyLink Center’s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms at
the adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb’s stepped-up presence. Airbnb
wasespeciallyhelpfulforthosevisitorsonlimitedbudgets.
Our second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we were
partners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look in
occasionallytomakesurewehadn’tdriftedoffintola-laland.Shareholders,incontrast,shouldnotneedtocometo
Omaha to monitor how we look and sound. (In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn’t

On Saturday morning, we will have our fifth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target will
again be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager – in my
one brief flirtation with honest labor – I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good at this game.
Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and youmust fold them

The competition begins at 7:15, when contestants will make preliminary tosses. The eight throws judged

home.
And be sure to check out the Clayton home itself. It can be purchased for $78,900, fully installed on land
you provide. In past years, we’ve made many sales on the meeting day. Kevin Clayton will be on hand with his
orderbook.
At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer
period, which (including a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess,

A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from
around the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount
(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental
point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)

Andy Kilpatrick will introduce (and be glad to sign) the latest edition of his all-encompassing coverage of
Berkshire. It’s 1,304 pages and weighs 9.8 pounds. (My blurb for the book: “Ridiculously skimpy.”) Check out
PeterBevelin’snewbookaswell.PeterhaslongbeenakeenobserverofBerkshire.
We will also have a new, 20-page-longer edition of Berkshire’s 50-year commemorative book that at last
year’s meeting sold 12,000 copies. Since then, Carrie and I have uncovered additional material that we find
fascinating, suchassomeverypersonal letters sentbyGroverCleveland toEdwardButler,hisfriendandthethen-
publisher of The Buffalo News. Nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated, and the price
remains $20. Charlie and I will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5,000available for
saleatthemeeting.

Finally, Jeremy Miller has written Warren Buffett’s Ground Rules, a book that will debut at the annual
meeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd.
and of explaining how Berkshire’s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investment
theoryandpractice,youwillenjoythisbook.
An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the
credential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up
prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.
Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21⁄ 2 hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you
significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to
$1,000ormore.Spendthatmoneywithus.
At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will
again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the weekencompassing the meeting, thestore
did a record $44,239,493 of business. If you repeat that figure to a retailer, he is not going to believe you. (An
average week for NFM’s Omaha store – the highest-volume home furnishings store in the United States except for
ournewDallasstore–isabout$9million.)

We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,
shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25ththrough Saturday, May 7th.Duringthatperiod,please
identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing

On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will
bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top
bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. I will join them and hope to
haveAjitandCharlietherealso.
My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met
Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now,she’s a junior at Princeton,
having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test

asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-
mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed at
loomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of
TheNewYorkTimes,atarsorkin@nytimes.com.

An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the
insurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insurance
operations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our
hopeisthattheanalysts andjournalists willaskquestions that addtoourowners’understandingandknowledgeof

Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,
forsure,andthat’s thewaywelikeit.Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; wewanttogiveasmanyquestioners as

All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for

While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe
all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible,
should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issue
financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We

Forgoodreason,Iregularlyextoltheaccomplishmentsofouroperatingmanagers.TheyaretrulyAll-Stars
who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of our
managerstobeasshareholder-orientedascanbefoundintheuniverseoflargepublicly-ownedcompanies.Mostof
our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as
theirpaycheck.
Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This
group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federal
income tax return – that’s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! – oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns,

They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy
andpleasant. Theirefforts gobeyondactivities strictly related toBerkshire: Lastyear,forexample, theydealt with
the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also
handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries
(smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work
everyday.Infact,myjobbecomesmorefuneveryyear.
