Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results

HowWeMeasureOurselves
Our metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. From the start,
Charlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have – or have
not–accomplished.Thatkeepsusfromthetemptationofseeingwherethearrowofperformancelandsandthen
paintingthebull’seyearoundit.
Selecting the S&P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can
matchitsperformancebyholdinganindexfund.Whyshouldtheypayusformerelyduplicatingthatresult?
A more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&P. There are
good arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that is
thebesttest.Butyear-to-yearmarketpricescanbeextraordinarilyerratic.Evenevaluationscoveringaslongasa
decade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurement
period.SteveBallmer,ofMicrosoft,andJeffImmelt,ofGE,cantellyouaboutthatproblem,sufferingastheydo

TheidealstandardformeasuringouryearlyprogresswouldbethechangeinBerkshire’sper-shareintrinsic
value.Alas,thatvaluecannotbecalculatedwithanythingclosetoprecision,soweinsteaduseacrudeproxyfor
it: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93.
Additionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case at
Berkshire.Inaggregate,ourbusinessesareworthconsiderablymorethanthevaluesatwhichtheyarecarriedon
our books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and I
believe that our book value – understated though it is – supplies the most useful tracking device for changes in
intrinsicvalue.Bythismeasurement,astheopeningparagraphofthisletterstates,ourbookvaluesincethestart

We should note that had we instead chosen market prices as our yardstick, Berkshire’s results would
lookbetter,showingagainsincethestartoffiscal1965of22%compoundedannually.Surprisingly,thismodest
difference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year period
compared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965
Berkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereas
todayBerkshiresharesregularlysellatapremiumtotheaccountingvaluesofitsfirst-classbusinesses.
Summed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First,
wehaveneverhadanyfive-yearperiodbeginningwith1965-69andendingwith2005-09–andtherehavebeen
41ofthese–duringwhichourgaininbookvaluedidnotexceedtheS&P’sgain.Second,thoughwehavelagged
the S&P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&P in the
eleven years during which it delivered negative results. In other words, our defense has been better than our
offense,andthat’slikelytocontinue.
The big minus is that our performance advantage has shrunk dramatically as our size has grown, an
unpleasanttrendthatiscertaintocontinue.Tobesure,Berkshirehasmanyoutstandingbusinessesandacadreof

WhatWeDon’tDo
Longago,Charlielaidouthisstrongestambition:“AllIwanttoknowiswhereI’mgoingtodie,soI’ll
never go there.” That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled
“Invert, always invert” as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approach
works on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house and
wife.)
HereareafewexamplesofhowweapplyCharlie’sthinkingatBerkshire:
• Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can’t evaluate, no matter how exciting their
products may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth
thatawaitedsuchindustriesasautos(in1910),aircraft(in1930)andtelevisionsets(in1950).But
the future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of the
companiesenteringthoseindustries.Eventhesurvivorstendedtocomeawaybleeding.
Just because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean
wecanjudgewhatits profit margins andreturns oncapital willbeasahostofcompetitors battle
for supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to
comeseemsreasonablypredictable.Eventhen,wewillmakeplentyofmistakes.
• We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallback
positionatBerkshire.Instead,wewillalwaysarrangeouraffairssothatanyrequirementsforcash
we may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will be
constantlyrefreshedbyagusherofearningsfromourmanyanddiversebusinesses.
When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier
of liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured
$15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government for
help. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secure
Americanbusinessesthatneeded–withoutdelay–ourtangiblevoteofconfidence.Theremaining
$6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that was
completedwithoutpausewhile,elsewhere,panicreigned.

We pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. The $20 billion-plus of cash-
equivalentassetsthatwecustomarilyholdisearningapittanceatpresent.Butwesleepwell.
• We tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own, without our supervising and
monitoring them to any degree. That means we are sometimes late in spotting management
problems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which Charlie
and I would have disagreed had we been consulted. Most of our managers, however, use the
independence we grant them magnificently, rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner-
oriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. We would rather
suffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible coststhatcomefrom
decisionsmadetooslowly–ornotatall–becauseofastiflingbureaucracy.
With our acquisition of BNSF, we now have about 257,000 employees and literally hundreds of

to become some monolith that is overrun with committees, budget presentations and multiple

and I will limit ourselves to allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers and

To build a compatible shareholder population, we try to communicate with our owners directly
and informatively. Our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions were
reversed. Additionally, we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on the
Internet early on weekends, thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during a
non-tradingperiodtodigestjustwhathashappenedatourmulti-facetedenterprise.(Occasionally,
SEC deadlines force a non-Friday disclosure.) These matters simply can’t be adequately
summarized in a few paragraphs, nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline that
journalistssometimesseek.
Last year we saw, in one instance, how sound-bite reporting can go wrong. Among the 12,830
words in the annual letter was this sentence: “We are certain, for example, that the economy will
beinshamblesthroughout2009–andprobablywellbeyond–butthatconclusiondoesnottellus
whetherthemarketwillriseorfall.”Manynewsorganizationsreported–indeed,blared–thefirst
part of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. I regard this as terrible
journalism: Misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that Charlie and I were
forecasting bad things for the stock market, though we had not only in that sentence, but also
elsewhere, made it clear we weren’t predicting the market at all. Any investors who were misled
bythe sensationalists paid a big price: TheDowclosedthedayoftheletter at7,063andfinished

Given a few experiences we’ve had like that, you can understand why I prefer that our

Insurance
Ourproperty-casualty(P/C)insurancebusinesshasbeentheenginebehindBerkshire’sgrowthandwill
continue to be. It has worked wonders for us. We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion more
than their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our “Goodwill” account. These companies, however, are
worthfarmorethantheircarryingvalue–andthefollowinglookattheeconomicmodeloftheP/Cindustrywill
tellyouwhy.
Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from
certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model
leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to
invest thisfloat forBerkshire’s benefit. Thoughindividualpoliciesandclaimscomeandgo,theamountoffloat
weholdremainsremarkablystableinrelationtopremiumvolume.Consequently,asourbusinessgrows,sodoes
ourfloat.
If premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that
adds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of free
money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition,
so vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.
This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Usually this cost is fairly low, but in some
catastrophe-ridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use of
float.
In my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I will
absolutelystatethatwehavethebestmanagers.Ourfloathasgrownfrom$16millionin1967,whenweentered
the business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for
seven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – though
certainlynotall–futureyears.Ifwedoso,ourfloatwillbecost-free,muchasifsomeonedeposited$62billion
withusthatwecouldinvestforourownbenefitwithoutthepaymentofinterest.
Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not a result to be expected for the P/C industry as a
whole: In most years, premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the
industry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the S&P
500. Outstanding economics exist at Berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running some
unusual businesses. Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars to
Berkshire’svalue.It’sapleasureformetotellyouabouttheseall-stars.

Let’s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertising
budget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by Tony

GEICO’s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here’s proof: Since Berkshire

invest.
In earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, the
best businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require little
incrementalinvestmenttogrow.Wearefortunatetoownanumberofsuchbusinesses,andwewouldlovetobuy
more. Anticipating, however, that Berkshire will generate ever-increasing amounts of cash, we are today quite
willingtoenterbusinessesthatregularlyrequirelargecapitalexpenditures.Weexpectonlythatthesebusinesses
have reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. If our expectations
are met – and we believe that they will be – Berkshire’s ever-growing collection of good to great businesses

Our BNSF operation, it should be noted, has certain important economic characteristics that resemble
thoseofourelectricutilities.Inbothcasesweprovidefundamentalservicesthatare,andwillremain,essentialto
the economic well-being of our customers, the communities we serve, and indeed the nation. Both will require
heavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. Both must also plan far
ahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. Finally, both require wise regulators
who will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investments
requiredtomaintain,replaceandexpandtheplant.
We see a “social compact” existing between the public and our railroad business, just as is the case
with our utilities. If either side shirks its obligations, both sides will inevitably suffer. Therefore, both parties to
the compact should – and we believe will – understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages good
behavior by the other. It is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economic
potential without its possessing first-class electricity and railroad systems. We will do our part to see that they
exist.
In the future, BNSF results will be included in this “regulated utility” section. Aside from the two
businesses having similar underlying economic characteristics, both are logical users of substantial amounts of
debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Both will retain most of their earnings. Bothwill earn and invest large
sums in good times or bad, though the railroad will display the greater cyclicality. Overall, we expect this

Among the businesses we own that have major exposure to the depressed industrial sector, both
Marmon and Iscar turned in relatively strong performances. Frank Ptak’s Marmon delivered a 13.5% pre-tax
profit margin, a record high. Though the company’s sales were down27%, Frank’s cost-conscious management
mitigatedthedeclineinearnings.
Nothing stops Israel-based Iscar – not wars, recessions or competitors. The world’s two other leading
suppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of the
year. Though Iscar’s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, even
while it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about last
year. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of Eitan
Wertheimer,JacobHarpazandDannyGoldmanwillseetothat.
Every business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely
in 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and MiTek were $227 million, an
82.5% decline from $1.295billion in 2006,whenconstruction activity wasbooming. These businesses continue

Our largest operation in this sector is Clayton Homes, the country’s leading producer of modular and
manufactured homes. Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers were
Fleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All have
since gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000units in 1999to 60,000units in
2009.
Theindustry isinshambles fortworeasons, thefirst ofwhichmustbelivedwithiftheU.S.economy
istorecover.ThisreasonconcernsU.S.housingstarts(includingapartmentunits).In2009,startswere554,000,
byfarthelowestnumberinthe50yearsforwhichwehavedata.Paradoxically,thisisgoodnews.
Peoplethoughtitwasgoodnewsafewyearsbackwhenhousingstarts–thesupplysideofthepicture
– were running about two million annually. But household formations – the demand side – only amounted to
about 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too many
houses.
There were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the
destruction of autos that occurred with the “cash-for-clunkers” program; (2) speed up household formations by,
say, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reduce
newhousingstartstoanumberfarbelowtherateofhouseholdformations.
Our country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residential
housing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certain
localitieswhereoverbuildingwasparticularlyegregious.Priceswillremainfarbelow“bubble”levels,ofcourse,
butforeveryseller(orlender)hurtbythistherewillbeabuyerwhobenefits.Indeed,manyfamiliesthatcouldn’t
affordtobuyanappropriatehomeafewyearsagonowfinditwellwithintheirmeansbecausethebubbleburst.
The second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive
differential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. Before you read further, let me
underscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary that
followswithspecialcare.Thatwarningmade,however,letmeexplainwhytheratedifferentialcausesproblems
forbothlargenumbersoflower-incomeAmericansandClayton.
The residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie
Mac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typically
be securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers of
conventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 51⁄ 4%. In
addition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, an
actionthatalsohelpedtokeepratesatbargain-basementlevels.
In contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a
meritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton’s
homesofferterrificvalue.Ifthebuyerneedsmortgagefinancing,however–and,ofcourse,mostbuyersdo–the
differenceinfinancingcoststoooftennegatestheattractivepriceofafactory-builthome.
12
LastyearItoldyouwhyourbuyers–generallypeoplewithlowincomes–performedsowellascredit
risks. Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it.
Consequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren’t
making “liar’s loans”) and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs,had
health problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simply
because house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton’s delinquencies and
defaultsremainreasonableandwillnotcauseussignificantproblems.
We have tried to qualify more of our customers’ loans for treatment similar to those available on the
site-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsible
habits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to the
factory-built product makes monthly payments too expensive. If qualifications aren’t broadened, so as to open
low-costfinancingtoallwhomeetdown-paymentandincomestandards,themanufactured-homeindustryseems
destinedtostruggleanddwindle.
Even under these conditions, I believe Clayton will operate profitably in coming years, though well

At the end of 2009, we became a 50% owner of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage (formerly known as
Capmark), the country’s third-largest servicer of commercial mortgages. In addition to servicing a $235 billion
portfolio, the company is an important originator of mortgages, having 25 offices spread around the country.
Though commercial real estate will face major problems in the next few years, long-term opportunities for

Last year I wrote extensively about our derivatives contracts, which were then the subject of both
controversyandmisunderstanding.Forthatdiscussion,pleasegotowww.berkshirehathaway.com.
We have since changed only a few of our positions. Some credit contracts have run off. The terms of
about 10% of our equity put contracts have also changed: Maturities have been shortened and strike prices
materiallyreduced.Inthesemodifications,nomoneychangedhands.
Afewpointsfromlastyear’sdiscussionareworthrepeating:
(1) Though it’s no sure thing, I expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime,
even when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in the
calculation. Our derivatives float – which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float I
describedearlier–wasabout$6.3billionatyearend.
(2) Onlyahandfulofourcontractsrequireustopostcollateralunderanycircumstances.Atlastyear’slow
point in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of the
derivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put up
continuetoearnmoneyforouraccount.
(3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affect
our reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings.
That thought certainly fit 2009’s circumstances. Here are the pre-tax quarterly gains and losses from
derivativesvaluationsthatwerepartofourreportedearningslastyear:
Quarter $Gain(Loss)inBillions
1 (1.517)
2 2.357

As we’ve explained, these wild swings neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. When we report to
you,wewillcontinuetoseparateoutthesefigures(aswedorealizedinvestmentgainsandlosses)sothatyoucan
more clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. We are delighted that we hold the derivatives
contracts that we do. To date we have significantly profited from the float they provide. We expect also to earn

We have long invested inderivatives contracts that Charlie andIthinkaremispriced, justaswetryto
invest in mispriced stocks andbonds.Indeed,wefirst reported toyouthat weheldsuchcontracts inearly 1998.
The dangers that derivatives pose for both participants and society – dangers of which we’ve long warned, and
that can be dynamite – arise when these contracts lead to leverage and/or counterparty risk that is extreme. At
Berkshirenothinglikethathasoccurred–norwillit.
It’smyjobtokeepBerkshirefarawayfromsuchproblems.CharlieandIbelievethataCEOmustnot

MidAmerican,andtheminorrunoffcontractsatGeneralRe.IfBerkshireevergetsintrouble,itwillbemyfault.
ItwillnotbebecauseofmisjudgmentsmadebyaRiskCommitteeorChiefRiskOfficer.

In my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its
CEO bear full responsibility for risk control. If he’s incapable of handling that job, he should look for other
employment.Andifhefailsatit–withthegovernmentthereuponrequiredtostepinwithfundsorguarantees–

CEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by their

insurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; some

AnInconvenientTruth(BoardroomOverheating)

effect, using counterfeit money. Periodically, many air-for-assets acquisitions have taken place, the late 1960s
having been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. Indeed, certain large companies were built in this
way. (No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there is

In the end, Charlie and I decided that the disadvantage of paying 30% of the price through stock was
offset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy $22 billion of cash in a business we understood and
liked for the long term. It has the additional virtue of being run by Matt Rose, whom we trust and admire. We
also like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. But the final

I have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated, often with the
directors being instructed byhigh-priced investment bankers (are there any other kind?).Invariably, thebankers

I can’t resist telling you a true story from long ago. We owned stock in a large well-run bank that for
decades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. Eventually, the law was changed and our bank
immediately began looking for possible purchases. Its managers – fine people and able bankers – not
unexpectedlybegantobehaveliketeenageboyswhohadjustdiscoveredgirls.
They soon focused on a much smaller bank, also well-run and having similar financial characteristics
in such areas as return on equity, interest margin, loan quality, etc. Our bank sold at a modest price (that’s why
we had bought into it), hovering near book value and possessing a very low price/earnings ratio. Alongside,

TheAnnualMeeting
Our best guess is that 35,000 people attended the annual meeting last year (up from 12 – no zeros
omitted –in1981).Withourshareholder population muchexpanded,weexpectevenmorethisyear.Therefore,
we will have to make a few changes in the usual routine. There will be no change, however, in our enthusiasm
forhavingyouattend.CharlieandIliketomeetyou,answeryourquestionsand–bestofall–haveyoubuylots
ofgoodsfromourbusinesses.
The meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 1st. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest
Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the
question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:30. After a
short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’s
questionperiods,pleasedosowhileCharlieistalking.(Actfast;hecanbeterse.)
The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-
foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did
your part, and most locations racked up record sales. But you can do better. (A friendly warning: If I find sales
arelagging,Igettestyandlocktheexits.)
GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of
them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a
shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we
operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given
certain groups.)Bringthedetails ofyourexisting insurance andcheckoutwhetherwecansaveyoumoney.For

Be sure to visit the Bookworm. Among the more than 30 books and DVDs it will offer are two new
books by my sons: Howard’s Fragile, a volume filled with photos and commentary about lives of struggle
around the globe and Peter’s Life Is What You Make It. Completing the family trilogy will be the debut of my

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the
credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Asfor plane, hotel and car reservations,
we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, who

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we
will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make
your purchases between Thursday, April 29th and Monday, May 3rd inclusive, and also present your meeting
credential. Theperiod’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that
normallyhaveironcladrulesagainstdiscountingbutwhich,inthespiritofourshareholderweekend,havemade
an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a
BerkyvilleBBQtowhichyouareallinvited.
At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception
from6p.m.to10p.m.onFriday,April30th.Thesecond,themaingala,willbeheldonSunday,May2nd,from9
a.m.to4p.m.OnSaturday,wewillbeopenuntil6p.m.
We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,
shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 26th through Saturday, May 8th. During that period,
please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that
shows you are a Berkshire holder. Enter with rhinestones; leave with diamonds. My daughter tells me that the
moreyoubuy,themoreyousave(kidssaythedarnedestthings).
OnSunday,inthemalloutsideofBorsheims,ablindfoldedPatrickWolff,twiceU.S.chesschampion,
will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a
remarkablemagicianfromDallas,willbewilderonlookers.
Our special treat for shareholders this year will be the return of my friend, Ariel Hsing, the country’s
top-ranked junior table tennis player (and a good bet to win at the Olympics some day). Now 14, Ariel came to
the annual meeting four years ago and demolished all comers, including me. (You can witness my humiliating
defeatonYouTube;justtypeinArielHsingBerkshire.)
Naturally, I’ve been plotting a comeback and will take her on outside of Borsheims at 1:00 p.m. on
Sunday. It will be a three-point match, and after I soften her up, all shareholders are invited to try their luck at
similar three-point contests. Winners willbegivenaboxofSee’scandy.Wewillhaveequipmentavailable, but

Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 2nd, and will be
serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year, though, it was overwhelmed by demand. With many more diners
expected this year, I’ve asked myfriend, DonnaSheehan,atPiccolo’s –another favorite restaurant ofmine–to
serve shareholders onSundayas well. (Piccolo’s giantrootbeerfloat ismandatory foranyfanoffinedining.) I
plan to eat at both restaurants: All of the weekend action makes me really hungry, and I have favorite dishes at
each spot. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before) and at
Piccolo’scall402-342-9038.
Regrettably,wewillnotbeabletohaveareceptionforinternationalvisitorsthisyear.Ourcountgrew
to about 800 last year, and my simply signing one item per person took about 21⁄ 2 hours. Since we expect even
more international visitors this year, Charlie and I decided we must drop this function. But be assured, we
welcomeeveryinternationalvisitorwhocomes.
Last year we changed our method of determining what questions would be asked at the meeting and
received many dozens of letters applauding the new arrangement. We will therefore again have the same three
financialjournalistsleadthequestion-and-answerperiod,askingCharlieandmequestionsthatshareholdershave
submittedtothembye-mail.

The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at
cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross
Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted, each journalist will
choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me
yourquestionhasthebestchanceofbeingselectedifyoukeepitconciseandincludenomorethantwoquestions
in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if
yourquestionisselected.)
Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the
journalistswillpicksometoughonesandthat’sthewaywelikeit.
We will again have a drawing at 8:15 on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those shareholders
wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with
those from the winning shareholders. We’ve added 30 minutes tothequestion time andwillprobablyhavetime
forabout30questionsfromeachgroup.
***********
At 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams. We were born in America; had terrific
parents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came
equipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to that
experienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being. Moreover, we have
longhadjobsthatwelove,inwhichwearehelpedincountlesswaysbytalentedandcheerfulassociates.Indeed,
over the years, our work has become ever more fascinating; no wonder we tap-dance to work. If pushed, we
