    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1988 was $569 million, or\n20.0%. Over the last 24 years (that is, since present management\ntook over), our per-share book value has grown from $19.46 to\n$2,974.52, or at a rate of 23.0% compounded annually.\n\nWeve emphasized in past reports that what counts, however,\nis intrinsic business value - the figure, necessarily an\nestimate, indicating what all of our constituent businesses are\nworth. By our calculations, Berkshires intrinsic business value\nsignificantly exceeds its book value. Over the 24 years,\nbusiness value has grown somewhat faster than book value; in\n1988, however, book value grew the faster, by a bit.\n\nBerkshires past rates of gain in both book value and\nbusiness value were achieved under circumstances far different\nfrom those that now exist. Anyone ignoring these differences\nmakes the same mistake that a baseball manager would were he to\njudge the future prospects of a 42-year-old center fielder on the\nbasis of his lifetime batting average.\n\nImportant negatives affecting our prospects today are: (1) a\nless attractive stock market than generally existed over the past\n24 years; (2) higher corporate tax rates on most forms of\ninvestment income; (3) a far more richly-priced market for the\nacquisition of businesses; and (4) industry conditions for\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc., GEICO Corporation, and The Washington\nPost Company - Berkshires three permanent investments,\nconstituting about one-half of our net worth - that range from\nslightly to materially less favorable than those existing five to\nten years ago. All of these companies have superb management and\nstrong properties. But, at current prices, their upside\npotential looks considerably less exciting to us today than it\ndid some years ago.\n\nThe major problem we face, however, is a growing capital\nbase. Youve heard that from us before, but this problem, like\nage, grows in significance each year. (And also, just as with\nage, its better to have this problem continue to grow rather\nthan to have it solved.)\n\nFour years ago I told you that we needed profits of $3.9\nbillion to achieve a 15% annual return over the decade then\nahead. Today, for the next decade, a 15% return demands profits\nof $10.3 billion. That seems like a very big number to me and to\nCharlie Munger, Berkshires Vice Chairman and my partner. (Should\nthat number indeed prove too big, Charlie will find himself, in\nfuture reports, retrospectively identified as the senior\npartner.)\n\nAs a partial offset to the drag that our growing capital\nbase exerts upon returns, we have a very important advantage now\nthat we lacked 24 years ago. Then, all our capital was tied up\nin a textile business with inescapably poor economic\ncharacteristics. Today part of our capital is invested in some\nreally exceptional businesses.\n\nLast year we dubbed these operations the Sainted Seven:\nBuffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Scott\nFetzer Manufacturing Group, Sees, and World Book. In 1988 the\nSaints came marching in. You can see just how extraordinary\ntheir returns on capital were by examining the historical-cost\nfinancial statements on page 45, which combine the figures of the\nSainted Seven with those of several smaller units. With no\nbenefit from financial leverage, this group earned about 67% on\naverage equity capital.\n\nIn most cases the remarkable performance of these units\narises partially from an exceptional business franchise; in all\ncases an exceptional management is a vital factor. The\ncontribution Charlie and I make is to leave these managers alone.\n\nIn my judgment, these businesses, in aggregate, will\ncontinue to produce superb returns. Well need these: Without\nthis help Berkshire would not have a chance of achieving our 15%\ngoal. You can be sure that our operating managers will deliver;\nthe question mark in our future is whether Charlie and I can\neffectively employ the funds that they generate.\n\nIn that respect, we took a step in the right direction early\nin 1989 when we purchased an 80% interest in Borsheims, a\njewelry business in Omaha. This purchase, described later in\nthis letter, delivers exactly what we look for: an outstanding\nbusiness run by people we like, admire, and trust. Its a great\nway to start the year.",

    "content": "We have made a significant accounting change that was\nmandated for 1988, and likely will have another to make in 1990.\nWhen we move figures around from year to year, without any change\nin economic reality, one of our always-thrilling discussions of\naccounting is necessary.\n\nFirst, Ill offer my customary disclaimer: Despite the\nshortcomings of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),\nI would hate to have the job of devising a better set of rules.\nThe limitations of the existing set, however, need not be\ninhibiting: CEOs are free to treat GAAP statements as a beginning\nrather than an end to their obligation to inform owners and\ncreditors - and indeed they should. After all, any manager of a\nsubsidiary company would find himself in hot water if he reported\nbarebones GAAP numbers that omitted key information needed by his\nboss, the parent corporations CEO. Why, then, should the CEO\nhimself withhold information vitally useful to\nhis\nbosses - the\nshareholder-owners of the corporation?\n\nWhat needs to be reported is data - whether GAAP, non-GAAP,\nor extra-GAAP - that helps financially-literate readers answer\nthree key questions: (1) Approximately how much is this company\nworth? (2) What is the likelihood that it can meet its future\nobligations? and (3) How good a job are its managers doing, given\nthe hand they have been dealt?\n\nIn most cases, answers to one or more of these questions are\nsomewhere between difficult and impossible to glean from the\nminimum GAAP presentation. The business world is simply too\ncomplex for a single set of rules to effectively describe\neconomic reality for all enterprises, particularly those\noperating in a wide variety of businesses, such as Berkshire.\n\nFurther complicating the problem is the fact that many\nmanagements view GAAP not as a standard to be met, but as an\nobstacle to overcome. Too often their accountants willingly\nassist them. (How much, says the client, is two plus two?\nReplies the cooperative accountant, What number did you have in\nmind?) Even honest and well-intentioned managements sometimes\nstretch GAAP a bit in order to present figures they think will\nmore appropriately describe their performance. Both the\nsmoothing of earnings and the big bath quarter are white lie\ntechniques employed by otherwise upright managements.\n\nThen there are managers who actively use GAAP to deceive and\ndefraud. They know that many investors and creditors accept GAAP\nresults as gospel. So these charlatans interpret the rules\nimaginatively and record business transactions in ways that\ntechnically comply with GAAP but actually display an economic\nillusion to the world.\n\nAs long as investors - including supposedly sophisticated\ninstitutions - place fancy valuations on reported earnings that\nmarch steadily upward, you can be sure that some managers and\npromoters will exploit GAAP to produce such numbers, no matter\nwhat the truth may be. Over the years, Charlie and I have\nobserved many accounting-based frauds of staggering size. Few of\nthe perpetrators have been punished; many have not even been\ncensured. It has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen\nthan small sums with a gun.\n\nUnder one major change mandated by GAAP for 1988, we have\nbeen required to fully consolidate all our subsidiaries in our\nbalance sheet and earnings statement. In the past, Mutual\nSavings and Loan, and Scott Fetzer Financial (a credit company\nthat primarily finances installment sales of World Book and Kirby\nproducts) were consolidated on a one-line basis. That meant we\n(1) showed our equity in their combined net worths as a singleentry asset on Berkshires consolidated balance sheet and (2)\nincluded our equity in their combined annual earnings as a\nsingle-line income entry in our consolidated statement of\nearnings. Now the rules require that we consolidate each asset\nand liability of these companies in our balance sheet and each\nitem of their income and expense in our earnings statement.\n\nThis change underscores the need for companies also to\nreport segmented data: The greater the number of economically\ndiverse business operations lumped together in conventional\nfinancial statements, the less useful those presentations are and\nthe less able investors are to answer the three questions posed\nearlier. Indeed, the only reason we ever prepare consolidated\nfigures at Berkshire is to meet outside requirements. On the\nother hand, Charlie and I constantly study our segment data.\n\nNow that we are required to bundle more numbers in our GAAP\nstatements, we have decided to publish additional supplementary\ninformation that we think will help you measure both business\nvalue and managerial performance. (Berkshires ability to\ndischarge its obligations to creditors - the third question we\nlisted - should be obvious, whatever statements you examine.) In\nthese supplementary presentations, we will not necessarily follow\nGAAP procedures, or even corporate structure. Rather, we will\nattempt to lump major business activities in ways that aid\nanalysis but do not swamp you with detail. Our goal is to give\nyou important information in a form that we would wish to get it\nif our roles were reversed.\n\nOn pages 41-47 we show separate combined balance sheets and\nearnings statements for: (1) our subsidiaries engaged in financetype operations, which are Mutual Savings and Scott Fetzer\nFinancial; (2) our insurance operations, with their major\ninvestment positions itemized; (3) our manufacturing, publishing\nand retailing businesses, leaving aside certain non-operating\nassets and purchase-price accounting adjustments; and (4) an allother category that includes the non-operating assets (primarily\nmarketable securities) held by the companies in (3) as well as\nvarious assets and debts of the Wesco and Berkshire parent\ncompanies.",

    "content": "If you combine the earnings and the net worths of these four\nsegments, you will derive totals matching those shown on our GAAP\nstatements. However, we want to emphasize that our new\npresentation does not fall within the purview of our auditors,\nwho in no way bless it. (In fact, they may be horrified; I dont\nwant to ask.)\n\nI referred earlier to a major change in GAAP that is\nexpected in 1990. This change relates to the calculation of\ndeferred taxes, and is both complicated and controversial - so\nmuch so that its imposition, originally scheduled for 1989, was\npostponed for a year.\n\nWhen implemented, the new rule will affect us in various\nways. Most important, we will be required to change the way we\ncalculate our liability for deferred taxes on the unrealized\nappreciation of stocks held by our insurance companies.\n\nRight now, our liability is layered. For the unrealized\nappreciation that dates back to 1986 and earlier years, $1.2\nbillion, we have booked a 28% tax liability. For the unrealized\nappreciation built up since, $600 million, the tax liability has\nbeen booked at 34%. The difference reflects the increase in tax\nrates that went into effect in 1987.\n\nIt now appears, however, that the new accounting rule will\nrequire us to establish the entire liability at 34% in 1990,\ntaking the charge against our earnings. Assuming no change in\ntax rates by 1990, this step will reduce our earnings in that\nyear (and thereby our reported net worth) by $71 million. The\nproposed rule will also affect other items on our balance sheet,\nbut these changes will have only a minor impact on earnings and\nnet worth.\n\nWe have no strong views about the desirability of this\nchange in calculation of deferred taxes. We should point out,\nhowever, that neither a 28% nor a 34% tax liability precisely\ndepicts economic reality at Berkshire since we have no plans to\nsell the stocks in which we have the great bulk of our gains.\n\nTo those of you who are uninterested in accounting, I\napologize for this dissertation. I realize that many of you do\nnot pore over our figures, but instead hold Berkshire primarily\nbecause you know that: (1) Charlie and I have the bulk of our\nmoney in Berkshire; (2) we intend to run things so that your\ngains or losses are in direct proportion to ours; and (3) the\nrecord has so far been satisfactory. There is nothing\nnecessarily wrong with this kind of faith approach to\ninvesting. Other shareholders, however, prefer an analysis\napproach and we want to supply the information they need. In our\nown investing, we search for situations in which both approaches\ngive us the same answer.",

For that we thank our operating managers: You\nand I are fortunate to be associated with them.\n\nAt Berkshire, associations like these last a long time. We\ndo not remove superstars from our lineup merely because they have\nattained a specified age - whether the traditional 65, or the 95\nreached by Mrs. B on the eve of Hanukkah in 1988. Superb\nmanagers are too scarce a resource to be discarded simply because\na cake gets crowded with candles. Moreover, our experience with\nnewly-minted MBAs has not been that great. Their academic\nrecords always look terrific and the candidates always know just\nwhat to say; but too often they are short on personal commitment\nto the company and general business savvy. Its difficult to\nteach a new dog old tricks.\n\nHeres an update on our major non-insurance operations:\n\no\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin) and her\ncart roll on and on. Shes been the boss for 51 years, having\nstarted the business at 44 with $500. (Think what she would have\ndone with $1,000!) With Mrs. B, old age will always be ten years\naway.\n\nThe Mart, long the largest home furnishings store in the\ncountry, continues to grow. In the fall, the store opened a\ndetached 20,000 square foot Clearance Center, which expands our\nability to offer bargains in all price ranges.\n\nRecently Dillards, one of the most successful department\nstore operations in the country, entered the Omaha market. In\nmany of its stores, Dillards runs a full furniture department,\nundoubtedly doing well in this line. Shortly before opening in\nOmaha, however, William Dillard, chairman of the company,\nannounced that his new store would not sell furniture. Said he,\nreferring to NFM: We dont want to compete with them. We think\nthey are about the best there is.\n\nAt the Buffalo News we extol the value of advertising, and\nour policies at NFM prove that we practice what we preach. Over\nthe past three years NFM has been the largest ROP advertiser in\nthe Omaha World-Herald. (ROP advertising is the kind printed in\nthe paper, as contrasted to the preprinted-insert kind.) In no\nother major market, to my knowledge, is a home furnishings\noperation the leading customer of the newspaper. At times, we\nalso run large ads in papers as far away as Des Moines, Sioux\nCity and Kansas City - always with good results. It truly does\npay to advertise, as long as you have something worthwhile to\noffer.\n\nMrs. Bs son, Louie, and his boys, Ron and Irv, complete the\nwinning Blumkin team. Its a joy to work with this family. All\nits members have character that matches their extraordinary\nabilities.\n\no\nLast year I stated unequivocally that pre-tax margins at\nThe Buffalo News would fall in 1988. That forecast would have\nproved correct at almost any other newspaper our size or larger.\nBut Stan Lipsey - bless him - has managed to make me look\nfoolish.\n\nThough we increased our prices a bit less than the industry\naverage last year, and though our newsprint costs and wage rates\nrose in line with industry norms, Stan actually improved margins\na tad. No one in the newspaper business has a better managerial\nrecord. He has achieved it, furthermore, while running a paper\nthat gives readers an extraordinary amount of news. We believe\nthat our newshole percentage - the portion of the paper devoted\nto news - is bigger than that of any other dominant paper of our\nsize or larger. The percentage was 49.5% in 1988 versus 49.8% in\n1987. We are committed to keeping it around 50%, whatever the\nlevel or trend of profit margins.\n\nCharlie and I have loved the newspaper business since we\nwere youngsters, and we have had great fun with the News in the\n12 years since we purchased it. We were fortunate to find Murray\nLight, a top-flight editor, on the scene when we arrived and he\nhas made us proud of the paper ever since.\n\no\nSees Candies sold a record 25.1 million pounds in 1988.\nProspects did not look good at the end of October, but excellent\nChristmas volume, considerably better than the record set in\n1987, turned the tide.\n\nAs weve told you before, Sees business continues to become\nmore Christmas-concentrated. In 1988, the Company earned a\nrecord 90% of its full-year profits in December: $29 million out\nof $32.5 million before tax. (Its enough to make you believe in\nSanta Claus.) Decembers deluge of business produces a modest\nseasonal bulge in Berkshires corporate earnings. Another small\nbulge occurs in the first quarter, when most World Book annuals\nare sold.",

Upon reviewing his\nrecord, you may wonder what took us so long.\n\no\nAt Fechheimer, the Heldmans - Bob, George, Gary, Roger and\nFred - are the Cincinnati counterparts of the Blumkins. Neither\nfurniture retailing nor uniform manufacturing has inherently\nattractive economics. In these businesses, only exceptional\nmanagements can deliver high returns on invested capital. And\nthats exactly what the five Heldmans do. (As Mets announcer\nRalph Kiner once said when comparing pitcher Steve Trout to his\nfather, Dizzy Trout, the famous Detroit Tigers pitcher: Theres\na lot of heredity in that family.)\n\nFechheimer made a fairly good-sized acquisition in 1988.\nCharlie and I have such confidence in the business savvy of the\nHeldman family that we okayed the deal without even looking at\nit. There are very few managements anywhere - including those\nrunning the top tier companies of the\nFortune 500\n- in which we\nwould exhibit similar confidence.\n\nBecause of both this acquisition and some internal growth,\nsales at Fechheimer should be up significantly in 1989.\n\no\nAll of the operations managed by Ralph Schey - World Book,\nKirby, and The Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group - performed\nsplendidly in 1988. Returns on the capital entrusted to Ralph\ncontinue to be exceptional.\n\nWithin the Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group, particularly\nfine progress was recorded at its largest unit, Campbell\nHausfeld. This company, the countrys leading producer of small\nand medium-sized air compressors, has more than doubled earnings\nsince 1986.\n\nUnit sales at both Kirby and World Book were up\nsignificantly in 1988, with export business particularly strong.\nWorld Book became available in the Soviet Union in September,\nwhen that countrys largest American book store opened in Moscow.\nOurs is the only general encyclopedia offered at the store.\n\nRalphs personal productivity is amazing: In addition to\nrunning 19 businesses in superb fashion, he is active at The\nCleveland Clinic, Ohio University, Case Western Reserve, and a\nventure capital operation that has spawned sixteen Ohio-based\ncompanies and resurrected many others. Both Ohio and Berkshire\nare fortunate to have Ralph on their side.",

    "content": "It was in 1983 that Berkshire purchased an 80% interest in\nThe Nebraska Furniture Mart. Your Chairman blundered then by\nneglecting to ask Mrs. B a question any schoolboy would have\nthought of: Are there any more at home like you? Last month I\ncorrected the error: We are now 80% partners with another branch\nof the family.\n\nAfter Mrs. B came over from Russia in 1917, her parents and\nfive siblings followed. (Her two other siblings had preceded\nher.) Among the sisters was Rebecca Friedman who, with her\nhusband, Louis, escaped in 1922 to the west through Latvia in a\njourney as perilous as Mrs. Bs earlier odyssey to the east\nthrough Manchuria. When the family members reunited in Omaha\nthey had no tangible assets. However, they came equipped with an\nextraordinary combination of brains, integrity, and enthusiasm\nfor work - and thats all they needed. They have since proved\nthemselves invincible.\n\nIn 1948 Mr. Friedman purchased Borsheims, a small Omaha\njewelry store. He was joined in the business by his son, Ike, in\n1950 and, as the years went by, Ikes son, Alan, and his sons-inlaw, Marvin Cohn and Donald Yale, came in also.\n\nYou wont be surprised to learn that this family brings to\nthe jewelry business precisely the same approach that the\nBlumkins bring to the furniture business. The cornerstone for\nboth enterprises is Mrs. Bs creed: Sell cheap and tell the\ntruth. Other fundamentals at both businesses are: (1) single\nstore operations featuring huge inventories that provide\ncustomers with an enormous selection across all price ranges, (2)\ndaily attention to detail by top management, (3) rapid turnover,\n(4) shrewd buying, and (5) incredibly low expenses. The\ncombination of the last three factors lets both stores offer\neveryday prices that no one in the country comes close to\nmatching.\n\nMost people, no matter how sophisticated they are in other\nmatters, feel like babes in the woods when purchasing jewelry.\nThey can judge neither quality nor price. For them only one rule\nmakes sense: If you dont know jewelry, know the jeweler.\n\nI can assure you that those who put their trust in Ike\nFriedman and his family will never be disappointed. The way in\nwhich we purchased our interest in their business is the ultimate\ntestimonial. Borsheims had no audited financial statements;\nnevertheless, we didnt take inventory, verify receivables or\naudit the operation in any way. Ike simply told us what was so -\n- and on that basis we drew up a one-page contract and wrote a\nlarge check.\n\nBusiness at Borsheims has mushroomed in recent years as the\nreputation of the Friedman family has spread. Customers now come\nto the store from all over the country. Among them have been\nsome friends of mine from both coasts who thanked me later for\ngetting them there.\n\nBorsheims new links to Berkshire will change nothing in the\nway this business is run. All members of the Friedman family\nwill continue to operate just as they have before; Charlie and I\nwill stay on the sidelines where we belong. And when we say all\nmembers, the words have real meaning. Mr. and Mrs. Friedman, at\n88 and 87, respectively, are in the store daily. The wives of\nIke, Alan, Marvin and Donald all pitch in at busy times, and a\nfourth generation is beginning to learn the ropes.\n\nIt is great fun to be in business with people you have long\nadmired. The Friedmans, like the Blumkins, have achieved success\nbecause they have deserved success. Both families focus on\nwhats right for the customer and that, inevitably, works out\nwell for them, also. We couldnt have better partners.",

If premium\ngrowth meanwhile materially lags that 10% rate, underwriting\nlosses will mount, though the industrys tendency to underreserve\nwhen business turns bad may obscure their size for a time.

    "content": "The property-casualty insurance industry is not only\nsubnormally profitable, it is subnormally popular. (As Sam\nGoldwyn philosophized: In life, one must learn to take the\nbitter with the sour.) One of the ironies of business is that\nmany relatively-unprofitable industries that are plagued by\ninadequate prices habitually find themselves beat upon by irate\ncustomers even while other, hugely profitable industries are\nspared complaints, no matter how high their prices.\n\nTake the breakfast cereal industry, whose return on invested\ncapital is more than double that of the auto insurance industry\n(which is why companies like Kellogg and General Mills sell at\nfive times book value and most large insurers sell close to\nbook). The cereal companies regularly impose price increases,\nfew of them related to a significant jump in their costs. Yet\nnot a peep is heard from consumers. But when auto insurers raise\nprices by amounts that do not even match cost increases,\ncustomers are outraged. If you want to be loved, its clearly\nbetter to sell high-priced corn flakes than low-priced auto\ninsurance.\n\nThe antagonism that the public feels toward the industry can\nhave serious consequences: Proposition 103, a California\ninitiative passed last fall, threatens to push auto insurance\nprices down sharply, even though costs have been soaring. The\nprice cut has been suspended while the courts review the\ninitiative, but the resentment that brought on the vote has not\nbeen suspended: Even if the initiative is overturned, insurers\nare likely to find it tough to operate profitably in California.\n(Thank heavens the citizenry isnt mad at bonbons: If Proposition\n103 applied to candy as well as insurance, Sees would be forced\nto sell its product for $5.76 per pound. rather than the $7.60 we\ncharge - and would be losing money by the bucketful.)\n\nThe immediate direct effects on Berkshire from the\ninitiative are minor, since we saw few opportunities for profit\nin the rate structure that existed in California prior to the\nvote. However, the forcing down of prices would seriously affect\nGEICO, our 44%-owned investee, which gets about 10% of its\npremium volume from California. Even more threatening to GEICO\nis the possibility that similar pricing actions will be taken in\nother states, through either initiatives or legislation.\n\nIf voters insist that auto insurance be priced below cost,\nit eventually must be sold by government. Stockholders can\nsubsidize policyholders for a short period, but only taxpayers\ncan subsidize them over the long term. At most property-casualty\ncompanies, socialized auto insurance would be no disaster for\nshareholders. Because of the commodity characteristics of the\nindustry, most insurers earn mediocre returns and therefore have\nlittle or no economic goodwill to lose if they are forced by\ngovernment to leave the auto insurance business. But GEICO,\nbecause it is a low-cost producer able to earn high returns on\nequity, has a huge amount of economic goodwill at risk. In turn,\nso do we.\n\nAt Berkshire, in 1988, our premium volume continued to fall,\nand in 1989 we will experience a large decrease for a special\nreason: The contract through which we receive 7% of the business\nof Firemans Fund expires on August 31. At that time, we will\nreturn to Firemans Fund the unearned premiums we hold that\nrelate to the contract. This transfer of funds will show up in\nour premiums written account as a negative $85 million or so\nand will make our third-quarter figures look rather peculiar.\nHowever, the termination of this contract will not have a\nsignificant effect on profits.\n\nBerkshires underwriting results continued to be excellent\nin 1988. Our combined ratio (on a statutory basis and excluding\nstructured settlements and financial reinsurance) was 104.\nReserve development was favorable for the second year in a row,\nafter a string of years in which it was very unsatisfactory.\nDetails on both underwriting and reserve development appear on\npages 36-38.\n\nOur insurance volume over the next few years is likely to\nrun very low, since business with a reasonable potential for\nprofit will almost certainly be scarce. So be it. At Berkshire,\nwe simply will not write policies at rates that carry the\nexpectation of economic loss. We encounter enough troubles when\nwe expect a gain.\n\nDespite - or perhaps because of - low volume, our profit\npicture during the next few years is apt to be considerably\nbrighter than the industrys. We are sure to have an exceptional\namount of float compared to premium volume, and that augurs well\nfor profits. In 1989 and 1990 we expect our float/premiums\nratio to be at least three times that of the typical\nproperty/casualty company. Mike Goldberg, with special help from\nAjit Jain, Dinos Iordanou, and the National Indemnity managerial\nteam, has positioned us well in that respect.\n\nAt some point - we dont know when - we will be deluged with\ninsurance business. The cause will probably be some major\nphysical or financial catastrophe. But we could also experience\nan explosion in business, as we did in 1985, because large and\nincreasing underwriting losses at other companies coincide with\ntheir recognition that they are far underreserved. in the\nmeantime, we will retain our talented professionals, protect our\ncapital, and try not to make major mistakes.",

    "content": "*Although nominally a preferred stock, this security is\nfinancially equivalent to a common stock.\n\nOur permanent holdings - Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., GEICO\nCorporation, and The Washington Post Company - remain unchanged.\nAlso unchanged is our unqualified admiration of their\nmanagements: Tom Murphy and Dan Burke at Cap Cities, Bill Snyder\nand Lou Simpson at GEICO, and Kay Graham and Dick Simmons at The\nWashington Post. Charlie and I appreciate enormously the talent\nand integrity these managers bring to their businesses.\n\nTheir performance, which we have observed at close range,\ncontrasts vividly with that of many CEOs, which we have\nfortunately observed from a safe distance. Sometimes these CEOs\nclearly do not belong in their jobs; their positions,\nnevertheless, are usually secure. The supreme irony of business\nmanagement is that it is far easier for an inadequate CEO to keep\nhis job than it is for an inadequate subordinate.\n\nIf a secretary, say, is hired for a job that requires typing\nability of at least 80 words a minute and turns out to be capable\nof only 50 words a minute, she will lose her job in no time.\nThere is a logical standard for this job; performance is easily\nmeasured; and if you cant make the grade, youre out.\nSimilarly, if new sales people fail to generate sufficient\nbusiness quickly enough, they will be let go. Excuses will not\nbe accepted as a substitute for orders.\n\nHowever, a CEO who doesnt perform is frequently carried\nindefinitely. One reason is that performance standards for his\njob seldom exist. When they do, they are often fuzzy or they may\nbe waived or explained away, even when the performance shortfalls\nare major and repeated. At too many companies, the boss shoots\nthe arrow of managerial performance and then hastily paints the\nbullseye around the spot where it lands.\n\nAnother important, but seldom recognized, distinction\nbetween the boss and the foot soldier is that the CEO has no\nimmediate superior whose performance is itself getting measured.\nThe sales manager who retains a bunch of lemons in his sales\nforce will soon be in hot water himself. It is in his immediate\nself-interest to promptly weed out his hiring mistakes.\nOtherwise, he himself may be weeded out. An office manager who\nhas hired inept secretaries faces the same imperative.\n\nBut the CEOs boss is a Board of Directors that seldom\nmeasures itself and is infrequently held to account for\nsubstandard corporate performance. If the Board makes a mistake\nin hiring, and perpetuates that mistake, so what? Even if the\ncompany is taken over because of the mistake, the deal will\nprobably bestow substantial benefits on the outgoing Board\nmembers. (The bigger they are, the softer they fall.)\n\nFinally, relations between the Board and the CEO are\nexpected to be congenial. At board meetings, criticism of the\nCEOs performance is often viewed as the social equivalent of\nbelching. No such inhibitions restrain the office manager from\ncritically evaluating the substandard typist.\n\nThese points should not be interpreted as a blanket\ncondemnation of CEOs or Boards of Directors: Most are able and\nhard-working, and a number are truly outstanding. But the\nmanagement failings that Charlie and I have seen make us thankful\nthat we are linked with the managers of our three permanent\nholdings. They love their businesses, they think like owners,\nand they exude integrity and ability.\n\no\nIn 1988 we made major purchases of Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Pfd. (Freddie Mac) and Coca Cola. We expect to hold\nthese securities for a long time. In fact, when we own portions\nof outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our\nfavorite holding period is forever. We are just the opposite of\nthose who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform\nwell but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint.\nPeter Lynch aptly likens such behavior to cutting the flowers and\nwatering the weeds. Our holdings of Freddie Mac are the maximum\nallowed by law, and are extensively described by Charlie in his\nletter. In our consolidated balance sheet these shares are\ncarried at cost rather than market, since they are owned by\nMutual Savings and Loan, a non-insurance subsidiary.\n\nWe continue to concentrate our investments in a very few\ncompanies that we try to understand well. There are only a\nhandful of businesses about which we have strong long-term\nconvictions. Therefore, when we find such a business, we want to\nparticipate in a meaningful way. We agree with Mae West: Too\nmuch of a good thing can be wonderful.\n\no\nWe reduced our holdings of medium-term tax-exempt bonds by\nabout $100 million last year. All of the bonds sold were\nacquired after August 7,1986. When such bonds are held by\nproperty-casualty insurance companies, 15% of the tax-exempt\ninterest earned is subject to tax.\n\nThe $800 million position we still hold consists almost\nentirely of bonds grandfathered under the Tax Reform Act of\n1986, which means they are entirely tax-exempt. Our sales\nproduced a small profit and our remaining bonds, which have an\naverage maturity of about six years, are worth modestly more than\ncarrying value.\n\nLast year we described our holdings of short-term and\nintermediate-term bonds of Texaco, which was then in bankruptcy.\nDuring 1988, we sold practically all of these bonds at a pre-tax\nprofit of about $22 million. This sale explains close to $100\nmillion of the reduction in fixed-income securities on our\nbalance sheet.",

    "content": "We also told you last year about our holdings of another\nsecurity whose predominant characteristics are those of an\nintermediate fixed-income issue: our $700 million position in\nSalomon Inc 9% convertible preferred. This preferred has a\nsinking fund that will retire it in equal annual installments\nfrom 1995 to 1999. Berkshire carries this holding at cost. For\nreasons discussed by Charlie on page 69, the estimated market\nvalue of our holding has improved from moderately under cost at\nthe end of last year to moderately over cost at 1988 year end.\n\nThe close association we have had with John Gutfreund, CEO\nof Salomon, during the past year has reinforced our admiration\nfor him. But we continue to have no great insights about the\nnear, intermediate or long-term economics of the investment\nbanking business: This is not an industry in which it is easy to\nforecast future levels of profitability. We continue to believe\nthat our conversion privilege could well have important value\nover the life of our preferred. However, the overwhelming\nportion of the preferreds value resides in its fixed-income\ncharacteristics, not its equity characteristics.\n\no\nWe have not lost our aversion to long-term bonds. We will\nbecome enthused about such securities only when we become\nenthused about prospects for long-term stability in the\npurchasing power of money. And that kind of stability isnt in\nthe cards: Both society and elected officials simply have too\nmany higher-ranking priorities that conflict with purchasingpower stability. The only long-term bonds we hold are those of\nWashington Public Power Supply Systems (WPPSS). A few of our\nWPPSS bonds have short maturities and many others, because of\ntheir high coupons, are likely to be refunded and paid off in a\nfew years. Overall, our WPPSS holdings are carried on our\nbalance sheet at $247 million and have a market value of about\n$352 million.\n\nWe explained the reasons for our WPPSS purchases in the 1983\nannual report, and are pleased to tell you that this commitment\nhas worked out about as expected. At the time of purchase, most\nof our bonds were yielding around 17% after taxes and carried no\nratings, which had been suspended. Recently, the bonds were\nrated AA- by Standard & Poors. They now sell at levels only\nslightly below those enjoyed by top-grade credits.\n\nIn the 1983 report, we compared the economics of our WPPSS\npurchase to those involved in buying a business. As it turned\nout, this purchase actually worked out better than did the\ngeneral run of business acquisitions made in 1983, assuming both\nare measured on the basis of unleveraged, after tax returns\nachieved through 1988.\n\nOur WPPSS experience, though pleasant, does nothing to alter\nour negative opinion about long-term bonds. It only makes us\nhope that we run into some other large stigmatized issue, whose\ntroubles have caused it to be significantly misappraised by the\nmarket.",

    "content": "In past reports we have told you that our insurance\nsubsidiaries sometimes engage in arbitrage as an alternative to\nholding short-term cash equivalents. We prefer, of course, to\nmake major long-term commitments, but we often have more cash\nthan good ideas. At such times, arbitrage sometimes promises\nmuch greater returns than Treasury Bills and, equally important,\ncools any temptation we may have to relax our standards for longterm investments. (Charlies sign off after weve talked about\nan arbitrage commitment is usually: Okay, at least it will keep\nyou out of bars.)\n\nDuring 1988 we made unusually large profits from arbitrage,\nmeasured both by absolute dollars and rate of return. Our pretax gain was about $78 million on average invested funds of about\n$147 million.\n\nThis level of activity makes some detailed discussion of\narbitrage and our approach to it appropriate. Once, the word\napplied only to the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities\nor foreign exchange in two different markets. The goal was to\nexploit tiny price differentials that might exist between, say,\nRoyal Dutch stock trading in guilders in Amsterdam, pounds in\nLondon, and dollars in New York. Some people might call this\nscalping; it wont surprise you that practitioners opted for the\nFrench term, arbitrage.\n\nSince World War I the definition of arbitrage - or risk\narbitrage, as it is now sometimes called - has expanded to\ninclude the pursuit of profits from an announced corporate event\nsuch as sale of the company, merger, recapitalization,\nreorganization, liquidation, self-tender, etc. In most cases the\narbitrageur expects to profit regardless of the behavior of the\nstock market. The major risk he usually faces instead is that\nthe announced event wont happen.\n\nSome offbeat opportunities occasionally arise in the\narbitrage field. I participated in one of these when I was 24\nand working in New York for Graham-Newman Corp. Rockwood & Co.,\na Brooklyn based chocolate products company of limited\nprofitability, had adopted LIFO inventory valuation in 1941\nwhen cocoa was selling for 5¢ per pound. In 1954 a\ntemporary shortage of cocoa caused the price to soar to over\n60&cent. Consequently Rockwood wished to unload its valuable\ninventory - quickly, before the price dropped. But if the cocoa\nhad simply been sold off, the company would have owed close to\na 50% tax on the proceeds.\n\nThe 1954 Tax Code came to the rescue. It contained an\narcane provision that eliminated the tax otherwise due on LIFO\nprofits if inventory was distributed to shareholders as part of a\nplan reducing the scope of a corporations business. Rockwood\ndecided to terminate one of its businesses, the sale of cocoa\nbutter, and said 13 million pounds of its cocoa bean inventory\nwas attributable to that activity. Accordingly, the company\noffered to repurchase its stock in exchange for the cocoa beans\nit no longer needed, paying 80 pounds of beans for each share.\n\nFor several weeks I busily bought shares, sold beans, and\nmade periodic stops at Schroeder Trust to exchange stock\ncertificates for warehouse receipts. The profits were good and\nmy only expense was subway tokens.\n\nThe architect of Rockwoods restructuring was an unknown,\nbut brilliant Chicagoan, Jay Pritzker, then 32. If youre\nfamiliar with Jays subsequent record, you wont be surprised to\nhear the action worked out rather well for Rockwoods continuing\nshareholders also. From shortly before the tender until shortly\nafter it, Rockwood stock appreciated from 15 to 100, even though\nthe company was experiencing large operating losses. Sometimes\nthere is more to stock valuation than price-earnings ratios.\n\nIn recent years, most arbitrage operations have involved\ntakeovers, friendly and unfriendly. With acquisition fever\nrampant, with anti-trust challenges almost non-existent, and with\nbids often ratcheting upward, arbitrageurs have prospered\nmightily. They have not needed special talents to do well; the\ntrick, a la Peter Sellers in the movie, has simply been Being\nThere. In Wall Street the old proverb has been reworded: Give a\nman a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to\narbitrage and you feed him forever. (If, however, he studied at\nthe Ivan Boesky School of Arbitrage, it may be a state\ninstitution that supplies his meals.)\n\nTo evaluate arbitrage situations you must answer four\nquestions: (1) How likely is it that the promised event will\nindeed occur? (2) How long will your money be tied up? (3) What\nchance is there that something still better will transpire - a\ncompeting takeover bid, for example? and (4) What will happen if\nthe event does not take place because of anti-trust action,\nfinancing glitches, etc.?\n\nArcata Corp., one of our more serendipitous arbitrage\nexperiences, illustrates the twists and turns of the business.\nOn September 28,1981 the directors of Arcata agreed in principle\nto sell the company to Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. (KKR),\nthen and now a major leveraged-buy out firm. Arcata was in the\nprinting and forest products businesses and had one other thing\ngoing for it: In 1978 the U. S. Government had taken title to\n10,700 acres of Arcata timber, primarily old-growth redwood, to\nexpand Redwood National Park. The government had paid $97.9\nmillion, in several installments, for this acreage, a sum Arcata\nwas contesting as grossly inadequate. The parties also disputed\nthe interest rate that should apply to the period between the\ntaking of the property and final payment for it. The enabling\nlegislation stipulated 6% simple interest; Arcata argued for a\nmuch higher and compounded rate.\n\nBuying a company with a highly-speculative, large-sized\nclaim in litigation creates a negotiating problem, whether the\nclaim is on behalf of or against the company. To solve this\nproblem, KKR offered $37.00 per Arcata share plus two-thirds of\nany additional amounts paid by the government for the redwood\nlands.",

    "content": "Appraising this arbitrage opportunity, we had to ask\nourselves whether KKR would consummate the transaction since,\namong other things, its offer was contingent upon its obtaining\nsatisfactory financing. A clause of this kind is always\ndangerous for the seller: It offers an easy exit for a suitor\nwhose ardor fades between proposal and marriage. However, we\nwere not particularly worried about this possibility because\nKKRs past record for closing had been good.\n\nWe also had to ask ourselves what would happen if the KKR\ndeal did fall through, and here we also felt reasonably\ncomfortable: Arcatas management and directors had been shopping\nthe company for some time and were clearly determined to sell.\nIf KKR went away, Arcata would likely find another buyer, though\nof course, the price might be lower.\n\nFinally, we had to ask ourselves what the redwood claim\nmight be worth. Your Chairman, who cant tell an elm from an\noak, had no trouble with that one: He coolly evaluated the claim\nat somewhere between zero and a whole lot.\n\nWe started buying Arcata stock, then around $33.50, on\nSeptember 30 and in eight weeks purchased about 400,000 shares,\nor 5% of the company. The initial announcement said that the\n$37.00 would be paid in January, 1982. Therefore, if everything\nhad gone perfectly, we would have achieved an annual rate of\nreturn of about 40% - not counting the redwood claim, which would\nhave been frosting.\n\nAll did not go perfectly. In December it was announced that\nthe closing would be delayed a bit. Nevertheless, a definitive\nagreement was signed on January 4. Encouraged, we raised our\nstake, buying at around $38.00 per share and increasing our\nholdings to 655,000 shares, or over 7% of the company. Our\nwillingness to pay up - even though the closing had been\npostponed - reflected our leaning toward a whole lot rather\nthan zero for the redwoods.\n\nThen, on February 25 the lenders said they were taking a\nsecond look at financing terms in view of the severely\ndepressed housing industry and its impact on Arcatas outlook.\nThe stockholders meeting was postponed again, to April. An\nArcata spokesman said he did not think the fate of the\nacquisition itself was imperiled. When arbitrageurs hear such\nreassurances, their minds flash to the old saying: He lied like\na finance minister on the eve of devaluation.\n\nOn March 12 KKR said its earlier deal wouldnt work, first\ncutting its offer to $33.50, then two days later raising it to\n$35.00. On March 15, however, the directors turned this bid down\nand accepted another groups offer of $37.50 plus one-half of any\nredwood recovery. The shareholders okayed the deal, and the\n$37.50 was paid on June 4.\n\nWe received $24.6 million versus our cost of $22.9 million;\nour average holding period was close to six months. Considering\nthe trouble this transaction encountered, our 15% annual rate of\nreturn excluding any value for the redwood claim - was more than\nsatisfactory.\n\nBut the best was yet to come. The trial judge appointed two\ncommissions, one to look at the timbers value, the other to\nconsider the interest rate questions. In January 1987, the first\ncommission said the redwoods were worth $275.7 million and the\nsecond commission recommended a compounded, blended rate of\nreturn working out to about 14%.\n\nIn August 1987 the judge upheld these conclusions, which\nmeant a net amount of about $600 million would be due Arcata.\nThe government then appealed. In 1988, though, before this\nappeal was heard, the claim was settled for $519 million.\nConsequently, we received an additional $29.48 per share, or\nabout $19.3 million. We will get another $800,000 or so in 1989.\n\nBerkshires arbitrage activities differ from those of many\narbitrageurs. First, we participate in only a few, and usually\nvery large, transactions each year. Most practitioners buy into\na great many deals perhaps 50 or more per year. With that many\nirons in the fire, they must spend most of their time monitoring\nboth the progress of deals and the market movements of the\nrelated stocks. This is not how Charlie nor I wish to spend our\nlives. (Whats the sense in getting rich just to stare at a\nticker tape all day?)\n\nBecause we diversify so little, one particularly profitable\nor unprofitable transaction will affect our yearly result from\narbitrage far more than it will the typical arbitrage operation.\nSo far, Berkshire has not had a really bad experience. But we\nwill - and when it happens well report the gory details to you.\n\nThe other way we differ from some arbitrage operations is\nthat we participate only in transactions that have been publicly\nannounced. We do not trade on rumors or try to guess takeover\ncandidates. We just read the newspapers, think about a few of\nthe big propositions, and go by our own sense of probabilities.\n\nAt yearend, our only major arbitrage position was 3,342,000\nshares of RJR Nabisco with a cost of $281.8 million and a market\nvalue of $304.5 million. In January we increased our holdings to\nroughly four million shares and in February we eliminated our\nposition. About three million shares were accepted when we\ntendered our holdings to KKR, which acquired RJR, and the\nreturned shares were promptly sold in the market. Our pre-tax\nprofit was a better-than-expected $64 million.\n\nEarlier, another familiar face turned up in the RJR bidding\ncontest: Jay Pritzker, who was part of a First Boston group that\nmade a tax-oriented offer. To quote Yogi Berra; It was deja vu\nall over again.\n\nDuring most of the time when we normally would have been\npurchasers of RJR, our activities in the stock were restricted\nbecause of Salomons participation in a bidding group.\nCustomarily, Charlie and I, though we are directors of Salomon,\nare walled off from information about its merger and acquisition\nwork. We have asked that it be that way: The information would\ndo us no good and could, in fact, occasionally inhibit\nBerkshires arbitrage operations.",

    "content": "However, the unusually large commitment that Salomon\nproposed to make in the RJR deal required that all directors be\nfully informed and involved. Therefore, Berkshires purchases of\nRJR were made at only two times: first, in the few days\nimmediately following managements announcement of buyout plans,\nbefore Salomon became involved; and considerably later, after the\nRJR board made its decision in favor of KKR. Because we could\nnot buy at other times, our directorships cost Berkshire\nsignificant money.\n\nConsidering Berkshires good results in 1988, you might\nexpect us to pile into arbitrage during 1989. Instead, we expect\nto be on the sidelines.\n\nOne pleasant reason is that our cash holdings are down -\nbecause our position in equities that we expect to hold for a\nvery long time is substantially up. As regular readers of this\nreport know, our new commitments are not based on a judgment\nabout short-term prospects for the stock market. Rather, they\nreflect an opinion about long-term business prospects for\nspecific companies. We do not have, never have had, and never\nwill have an opinion about where the stock market, interest\nrates, or business activity will be a year from now.\n\nEven if we had a lot of cash we probably would do little in\narbitrage in 1989. Some extraordinary excesses have developed in\nthe takeover field. As Dorothy says: Toto, I have a feeling\nwere not in Kansas any more.\n\nWe have no idea how long the excesses will last, nor do we\nknow what will change the attitudes of government, lender and\nbuyer that fuel them. But we do know that the less the prudence\nwith which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence\nwith which we should conduct our own affairs. We have no desire\nto arbitrage transactions that reflect the unbridled - and, in\nour view, often unwarranted - optimism of both buyers and\nlenders. In our activities, we will heed the wisdom of Herb\nStein: If something cant go on forever, it will end.",

    "content": "The preceding discussion about arbitrage makes a small\ndiscussion of efficient market theory (EMT) also seem relevant.\nThis doctrine became highly fashionable - indeed, almost holy\nscripture in academic circles during the 1970 s. Essentially, it\nsaid that analyzing stocks was useless because all public\ninformation about them was appropriately reflected in their\nprices. In other words, the market always knew everything. As a\ncorollary, the professors who taught EMT said that someone\nthrowing darts at the stock tables could select a stock portfolio\nhaving prospects just as good as one selected by the brightest,\nmost hard-working security analyst. Amazingly, EMT was embraced\nnot only by academics, but by many investment professionals and\ncorporate managers as well. Observing correctly that the market\nwas\nfrequently\nefficient, they went on to conclude incorrectly\nthat it was\nalways\nefficient. The difference between these\npropositions is night and day.\n\nIn my opinion, the continuous 63-year arbitrage experience\nof Graham-Newman Corp. Buffett Partnership, and Berkshire\nillustrates just how foolish EMT is. (Theres plenty of other\nevidence, also.) While at Graham-Newman, I made a study of its\nearnings from arbitrage during the entire 1926-1956 lifespan of\nthe company. Unleveraged returns averaged 20% per year.\nStarting in 1956, I applied Ben Grahams arbitrage principles,\nfirst at Buffett Partnership and then Berkshire. Though Ive not\nmade an exact calculation, I have done enough work to know that\nthe 1956-1988 returns averaged well over 20%. (Of course, I\noperated in an environment far more favorable than Bens; he had\n1929-1932 to contend with.)\n\nAll of the conditions are present that are required for a\nfair test of portfolio performance: (1) the three organizations\ntraded hundreds of different securities while building this 63 year record; (2) the results are not skewed by a few fortunate\nexperiences; (3) we did not have to dig for obscure facts or\ndevelop keen insights about products or managements - we simply\nacted on highly-publicized events; and (4) our arbitrage\npositions were a clearly identified universe - they have not been\nselected by hindsight.\n\nOver the 63 years, the general market delivered just under a\n10% annual return, including dividends. That means $1,000 would\nhave grown to $405,000 if all income had been reinvested. A 20%\nrate of return, however, would have produced $97 million. That\nstrikes us as a statistically-significant differential that\nmight, conceivably, arouse ones curiosity.\n\nYet proponents of the theory have never seemed interested in\ndiscordant evidence of this type. True, they dont talk quite as\nmuch about their theory today as they used to. But no one, to my\nknowledge, has ever said he was wrong, no matter how many\nthousands of students he has sent forth misinstructed. EMT,\nmoreover, continues to be an integral part of the investment\ncurriculum at major business schools. Apparently, a reluctance\nto recant, and thereby to demystify the priesthood, is not\nlimited to theologians.\n\nNaturally the disservice done students and gullible\ninvestment professionals who have swallowed EMT has been an\nextraordinary service to us and other followers of Graham. In\nany sort of a contest - financial, mental, or physical - its an\nenormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught that\nits useless to even try. From a selfish point of view,\nGrahamites should probably endow chairs to ensure the perpetual\nteaching of EMT.\n\nAll this said, a warning is appropriate. Arbitrage has\nlooked easy recently. But this is not a form of investing that\nguarantees profits of 20% a year or, for that matter, profits of\nany kind. As noted, the market is reasonably efficient much of\nthe time: For every arbitrage opportunity we seized in that 63 year period, many more were foregone because they seemed\nproperly-priced.\n\nAn investor cannot obtain superior profits from stocks by\nsimply committing to a specific investment category or style. He\ncan earn them only by carefully evaluating facts and continuously\nexercising discipline. Investing in arbitrage situations, per\nse, is no better a strategy than selecting a portfolio by\nthrowing darts.",

    "content": "Berkshires shares were listed on the New York Stock\nExchange on November 29,1988. On pages 50-51 we reproduce the\nletter we sent to shareholders concerning the listing.\n\nLet me clarify one point not dealt with in the letter:\nThough our round lot for trading on the NYSE is ten shares, any\nnumber of shares from one on up can be bought or sold.\n\nAs the letter explains, our primary goal in listing was to\nreduce transaction costs, and we believe this goal is being\nachieved. Generally, the spread between the bid and asked price\non the NYSE has been well below the spread that prevailed in the\nover-the-counter market.\n\nHenderson Brothers, Inc., the specialist in our shares, is\nthe oldest continuing specialist firm on the Exchange; its\nprogenitor, William Thomas Henderson, bought his seat for $500 on\nSeptember 8,1861. (Recently, seats were selling for about\n$625,000.) Among the 54 firms acting as specialists, HBI ranks\nsecond in number of stocks assigned, with 83. We were pleased\nwhen Berkshire was allocated to HBI, and have been delighted with\nthe firms performance. Jim Maguire, Chairman of HBI, personally\nmanages the trading in Berkshire, and we could not be in better\nhands.\n\nIn two respects our goals probably differ somewhat from\nthose of most listed companies. First, we do not want to\nmaximize the price at which Berkshire shares trade. We wish\ninstead for them to trade in a narrow range centered at intrinsic\nbusiness value (which we hope increases at a reasonable - or,\nbetter yet, unreasonable - rate). Charlie and I are bothered as\nmuch by significant overvaluation as significant undervaluation.\nBoth extremes will inevitably produce results for many\nshareholders that will differ sharply from Berkshires business\nresults. If our stock price instead consistently mirrors\nbusiness value, each of our shareholders will receive an\ninvestment result that roughly parallels the business results of\nBerkshire during his holding period.\n\nSecond, we wish for very little trading activity. If we ran\na private business with a few passive partners, we would be\ndisappointed if those partners, and their replacements,\nfrequently wanted to leave the partnership. Running a public\ncompany, we feel the same way.\n\nOur goal is to attract long-term owners who, at the time of\npurchase, have no timetable or price target for sale but plan\ninstead to stay with us indefinitely. We dont understand the\nCEO who wants lots of stock activity, for that can be achieved\nonly if many of his owners are constantly exiting. At what other\norganization - school, club, church, etc. - do leaders cheer when\nmembers leave? (However, if there were a broker whose livelihood\ndepended upon the membership turnover in such organizations, you\ncould be sure that there would be at least one proponent of\nactivity, as in: There hasnt been much going on in Christianity\nfor a while; maybe we should switch to Buddhism next week.)\n\nOf course, some Berkshire owners will need or want to sell\nfrom time to time, and we wish for good replacements who will pay\nthem a fair price. Therefore we try, through our policies,\nperformance, and communications, to attract new shareholders who\nunderstand our operations, share our time horizons, and measure\nus as we measure ourselves. If we can continue to attract this\nsort of shareholder - and, just as important, can continue to be\nuninteresting to those with short-term or unrealistic\nexpectations - Berkshire shares should consistently sell at\nprices reasonably related to business value.",

    "content": "Dave Dodd, my friend and teacher for 38 years, died last\nyear at age 93. Most of you dont know of him. Yet any longtime shareholder of Berkshire is appreciably wealthier because of\nthe indirect influence he had upon our company.\n\nDave spent a lifetime teaching at Columbia University, and\nhe co-authored\nSecurity Analysis\nwith Ben Graham. From the\nmoment I arrived at Columbia, Dave personally encouraged and\neducated me; one influence was as important as the other.\nEverything he taught me, directly or through his book, made\nsense. Later, through dozens of letters, he continued my\neducation right up until his death.\n\nI have known many professors of finance and investments but\nI have never seen any, except for Ben Graham, who was the match\nof Dave. The proof of his talent is the record of his students:\nNo other teacher of investments has sent forth so many who have\nachieved unusual success.\n\nWhen students left Daves classroom, they were equipped to\ninvest intelligently for a lifetime because the principles he\ntaught were simple, sound, useful, and enduring. Though these\nmay appear to be unremarkable virtues, the teaching of principles\nembodying them has been rare.\n\nIts particularly impressive that Dave could practice as\nwell as preach. just as Keynes became wealthy by applying his\nacademic ideas to a very small purse, so, too, did Dave. Indeed,\nhis financial performance far outshone that of Keynes, who began\nas a market-timer (leaning on business and credit-cycle theory)\nand converted, after much thought, to value investing. Dave was\nright from the start.\n\nIn Berkshires investments, Charlie and I have employed the\nprinciples taught by Dave and Ben Graham. Our prosperity is the\nfruit of their intellectual tree.",

    "content": "We hope to buy more businesses that are similar to the ones\nwe have, and we can use some help. If you have a business that\nfits the following criteria, call me or, preferably, write.\n\nHeres what were looking for:\n\n(1) large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections\nare of little interest to us, nor are turnaround\nsituations),\n\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while employing\nlittle or no debt,\n\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we wont\nunderstand it),\n\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time or that\nof the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a\ntransaction when price is unknown).\n\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested. We prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive\nas much in intrinsic business value as we give.\n\nOur favorite form of purchase is one fitting the Blumkin Friedman-Heldman mold. In cases like these, the companys ownermanagers wish to generate significant amounts of cash, sometimes\nfor themselves, but often for their families or inactive\nshareholders. However, these managers also wish to remain\nsignificant owners who continue to run their companies just as\nthey have in the past. We think we offer a particularly good fit\nfor owners with these objectives and invite potential sellers to\ncheck us out by contacting people with whom we have done business\nin the past.\n\nCharlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions\nthat dont come close to meeting our tests: Weve found that if\nyou advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will\ncall hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. Our interest in\nnew ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales can best be\nexpressed by another Goldwynism: Please include me out.\n\nBesides being interested in the purchase of businesses as\ndescribed above, we are also interested in the negotiated\npurchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of stock\ncomparable to those we hold in Cap Cities and Salomon. We have a\nspecial interest in purchasing convertible preferreds as a longterm investment, as we did at Salomon.\n\n* * *\n\nWe received some good news a few weeks ago: Standard &\nPoors raised our credit rating to AAA, which is the highest\nrating it bestows. Only 15 other U. S. industrial or propertycasualty companies are rated AAA, down from 28 in 1980.\n\nCorporate bondholders have taken their lumps in the past few\nyears from event risk. This term refers to the overnight\ndegradation of credit that accompanies a heavily-leveraged\npurchase or recapitalization of a business whose financial\npolicies, up to then, had been conservative. In a world of\ntakeovers inhabited by few owner-managers, most corporations\npresent such a risk. Berkshire does not. Charlie and I promise\nbondholders the same respect we afford shareholders.\n\n* * *\n\nAbout 97.4% of all eligible shares participated in\nBerkshires 1988 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions made through the program were $5 million, and 2,319\ncharities were recipients. If we achieve reasonable business\nresults, we plan to increase the per-share contributions in 1989.\n\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 48-49. If you wish to participate in future programs, we\nstrongly urge that you immediately make sure your shares are\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not in the nominee\nname of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so registered\non September 30,1989 will be ineligible for the 1989 program.\n\n* * *\n\nBerkshires annual meeting will be held in Omaha on Monday,\nApril 24,1989, and I hope you will come. The meeting provides\nthe forum for you to ask any owner-related questions you may\nhave, and we will keep answering until all (except those dealing\nwith portfolio activities or other proprietary information) have\nbeen dealt with.\n\nAfter the meeting we will have several buses available to\ntake you to visit Mrs. B at The Nebraska Furniture Mart and Ike\nFriedman at Borsheims. Be prepared for bargains.\n\nOut-of-towners may prefer to arrive early and visit Mrs. B\nduring the Sunday store hours of noon to five. (These Sunday\nhours seem ridiculously short to Mrs. B, who feels they scarcely\nallow her time to warm up; she much prefers the days on which the\nstore remains open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m.) Borsheims, however, is\nnot open on Sunday.\n\nAsk Mrs. B the secret of her astonishingly low carpet\nprices. She will confide to you - as she does to everyone - how\nshe does it: I can sell so cheap cause I work for this dummy\nwho doesnt know anything about carpet.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 28,1989 Chairman of the Board",
