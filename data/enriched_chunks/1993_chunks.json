    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur per-share book value increased 14.3% during 1993. Over\nthe last 29 years (that is, since present management took over)\nbook value has grown from $19 to $8,854, or at a rate of 23.3%\ncompounded annually.\n\nDuring the year, Berkshire's net worth increased by $1.5\nbillion, a figure affected by two negative and two positive nonoperating items. For the sake of completeness, I'll explain them\nhere. If you aren't thrilled by accounting, however, feel free\nto fast-forward through this discussion:\n\n1. The first negative was produced by a change in\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)\nhaving to do with the taxes we accrue against\nunrealized appreciation in the securities we\ncarry at market value. The old rule said that\nthe tax rate used should be the one in effect\nwhen the appreciation took place. Therefore,\nat the end of 1992, we were using a rate of 34%\non the $6.4 billion of gains generated after\n1986 and 28% on the $1.2 billion of gains\ngenerated before that. The new rule stipulates\nthat the current tax rate should be applied to\nall gains. The rate in the first quarter of\n1993, when this rule went into effect, was 34%.\nApplying that rate to our pre-1987 gains\nreduced net worth by $70 million.\n\n2. The second negative, related to the first, came\nabout because the corporate tax rate was raised\nin the third quarter of 1993 to 35%. This\nchange required us to make an additional charge\nof 1% against all of our unrealized gains, and\nthat charge penalized net worth by $75 million.\nOddly, GAAP required both this charge and the\none described above to be deducted from the\nearnings we report, even though the unrealized\nappreciation that gave rise to the charges was\nnever included in earnings, but rather was\ncredited directly to net worth.\n\n3. Another 1993 change in GAAP affects the value\nat which we carry the securities that we own.\nIn recent years, both the common stocks and\ncertain common-equivalent securities held by\nour insurance companies have been valued at\nmarket, whereas equities held by our noninsurance subsidiaries or by the parent company\nwere carried at their aggregate cost or market,\nwhichever was lower. Now GAAP says that\nall\n\ncommon stocks should be carried at market, a\nrule we began following in the fourth quarter\nof 1993. This change produced a gain in\nBerkshire's reported net worth of about $172\nmillion.\n\n4. Finally, we issued some stock last year. In a\ntransaction described in last year's Annual\nReport, we issued 3,944 shares in early\nJanuary, 1993 upon the conversion of $46\nmillion convertible debentures that we had\ncalled for redemption. Additionally, we issued\n25,203 shares when we acquired Dexter Shoe, a\npurchase discussed later in this report. The\noverall result was that our shares outstanding\nincreased by 29,147 and our net worth by about\n$478 million. Per-share book value also grew,\nbecause the shares issued in these transactions\ncarried a price above their book value.",

    "content": "Of course, it's per-share intrinsic value, not book value,\nthat counts. Book value is an accounting term that measures the\ncapital, including retained earnings, that has been put into a\nbusiness. Intrinsic value is a present-value estimate of the\ncash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining\nlife. At most companies, the two values are unrelated.\nBerkshire, however, is an exception: Our book value, though\nsignificantly below our intrinsic value, serves as a useful\ndevice for tracking that key figure. In 1993, each measure grew\nby roughly 14%, advances that I would call satisfactory but\nunexciting.\n\nThese gains, however, were outstripped by a much larger gain\n- 39% - in Berkshire's market price. Over time, of course,\nmarket price and intrinsic value will arrive at about the same\ndestination. But in the short run the two often diverge in a\nmajor way, a phenomenon I've discussed in the past. Two years\nago, Coca-Cola and Gillette, both large holdings of ours, enjoyed\nmarket price increases that dramatically outpaced their earnings\ngains. In the 1991 Annual Report, I said that the stocks of\nthese companies could not continuously overperform their\nbusinesses.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, Coke and Gillette increased their annual\noperating earnings per share by 38% and 37% respectively, but\ntheir market prices moved up only 11% and 6%. In other words,\nthe companies overperformed their stocks, a result that no doubt\npartly reflects Wall Street's new apprehension about brand names.\nWhatever the reason, what will count over time is the earnings\nperformance of these companies. If they prosper, Berkshire will\nalso prosper, though not in a lock-step manner.\n\nLet me add a lesson from history: Coke went public in 1919\nat $40 per share. By the end of 1920 the market, coldly\nreevaluating Coke's future prospects, had battered the stock down\nby more than 50%, to $19.50. At yearend 1993, that single share,\nwith dividends reinvested, was worth more than $2.1 million. As\nBen Graham said: \"In the short-run, the market is a voting\nmachine - reflecting a voter-registration test that requires only\nmoney, not intelligence or emotional stability - but in the longrun, the market is a weighing machine.\"\n\nSo how should Berkshire's over-performance in the market\nlast year be viewed? Clearly, Berkshire was selling at a higher\npercentage of intrinsic value at the end of 1993 than was the\ncase at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, in a world\nof 6% or 7% long-term interest rates, Berkshire's market price\nwas not inappropriate if - and you should understand that this is\na huge if - Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman, and I can\nattain our long-standing goal of increasing Berkshire's per-share\nintrinsic value at an average annual rate of 15%. We have not\nretreated from this goal. But we again emphasize, as we have for\nmany years, that the growth in our capital base makes 15% an\never-more difficult target to hit.\n\nWhat we have going for us is a growing collection of goodsized operating businesses that possess economic characteristics\nranging from good to terrific, run by managers whose performance\nranges from terrific to terrific. You need have no worries about\nthis group.\n\nThe capital-allocation work that Charlie and I do at the\nparent company, using the funds that our managers deliver to us,\nhas a less certain outcome: It is not easy to find new\nbusinesses and managers comparable to those we have. Despite\nthat difficulty, Charlie and I relish the search, and we are\nhappy to report an important success in 1993.",

    "content": "Dexter Shoe\n\nWhat we did last year was build on our 1991 purchase of H.\nH. Brown, a superbly-run manufacturer of work shoes, boots and\nother footwear. Brown has been a real winner: Though we had\nhigh hopes to begin with, these expectations have been\nconsiderably exceeded thanks to Frank Rooney, Jim Issler and the\ntalented managers who work with them. Because of our confidence\nin Frank's team, we next acquired Lowell Shoe, at the end of\n1992. Lowell was a long-established manufacturer of women's and\nnurses' shoes, but its business needed some fixing. Again,\nresults have surpassed our expectations. So we promptly jumped\nat the chance last year to acquire Dexter Shoe of Dexter, Maine,\nwhich manufactures popular-priced men's and women's shoes.\nDexter, I can assure you, needs\nno\nfixing: It is one of the\nbest-managed companies Charlie and I have seen in our business\nlifetimes.\n\nHarold Alfond, who started working in a shoe factory at 25\ncents an hour when he was 20, founded Dexter in 1956 with $10,000\nof capital. He was joined in 1958 by Peter Lunder, his nephew.\nThe two of them have since built a business that now produces over\n7.5 million pairs of shoes annually, most of them made in Maine\nand the balance in Puerto Rico. As you probably know, the\ndomestic shoe industry is generally thought to be unable to\ncompete with imports from low-wage countries. But someone forgot\nto tell this to the ingenious managements of Dexter and H. H.\nBrown and to their skilled labor forces, which together make the\nU. S. plants of both companies highly competitive against all\ncomers.\n\nDexter's business includes 77 retail outlets, located\nprimarily in the Northeast. The company is also a major\nmanufacturer of golf shoes, producing about 15% of U. S. output.\nIts bread and butter, though, is the manufacture of traditional\nshoes for traditional retailers, a job at which it excels: Last\nyear both Nordstrom and J. C. Penney bestowed special awards upon\nDexter for its performance as a supplier during 1992.\n\nOur 1993 results include Dexter only from our date of\nmerger, November 7 th. In 1994, we expect Berkshire's shoe\noperations to have more than $550 million in sales, and we would\nnot be surprised if the combined pre-tax earnings of these\nbusinesses topped $85 million. Five years ago we had no thought\nof getting into shoes. Now we have 7,200 employees in that\nindustry, and I sing \"There's No Business Like Shoe Business\" as\nI drive to work. So much for strategic plans.\n\nAt Berkshire, we have no view of the future that dictates\nwhat businesses or industries we will enter. Indeed, we think\nit's usually poison for a corporate giant's shareholders if it\nembarks upon new ventures pursuant to some grand vision. We\nprefer instead to focus on the economic characteristics of\nbusinesses that we wish to own and the personal characteristics\nof managers with whom we wish to associate - and then to hope we\nget lucky in finding the two in combination. At Dexter, we did.",

What they did, in effect,\nwas trade a 100% interest in a single terrific business for a\nsmaller interest in a large group of terrific businesses.

If they elect to\nretain their Berkshire shares, their investment result from the\nmerger date forward will exactly parallel my own result.

Finally, and of\nparamount importance, Harold and Peter can be sure that they will\nget to run their business - an activity they dearly love -\nexactly as they did before the merger. At Berkshire, we do not\ntell . 400 hitters how to swing.\n\nWhat made sense for Harold and Peter probably makes sense\nfor a few other owners of large private businesses.

    "content": "Look-Through Earnings\n\n\"Look-Through\" Earnings\n\nWe've previously discussed look-through earnings, which we\nbelieve more accurately portray the earnings of Berkshire than does\nour GAAP result. As we calculate them, look-through earnings\nconsist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\nsection, plus; (2) the retained operating earnings of major\ninvestees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our\nprofits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by\nBerkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead been\ndistributed to us. The \"operating earnings\" of which we speak here\nexclude capital gains, special accounting items and major\nrestructuring charges.\n\nOver time, our look-through earnings need to increase at about\n15% annually if our intrinsic value is to grow at that rate. Last\nyear, I explained that we had to increase these earnings to about\n$1.8 billion in the year 2000, were we to meet the 15% goal.\nBecause we issued additional shares in 1993, the amount needed has\nrisen to about $1.85 billion.\n\nThat is a tough goal, but one that we expect you to hold us\nto. In the past, we've criticized the managerial practice of\nshooting the arrow of performance and\nthen\npainting the target,\ncentering it on whatever point the arrow happened to hit. We will\ninstead risk embarrassment by painting first and shooting later.\n\nIf we are to hit the bull's-eye, we will need markets that\nallow the purchase of businesses and securities on sensible terms.\nRight now, markets are difficult, but they can - and will - change\nin unexpected ways and at unexpected times. In the meantime, we'll\ntry to resist the temptation to do something marginal simply\nbecause we are long on cash. There's no use running if you're on\nthe wrong road.\n\nThe following table shows how we calculate look-through\nearnings, though I warn you that the figures are necessarily\nvery\n\nrough. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been\nincluded in the operating earnings itemized on page 8, mostly\nunder \"Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.\")\n\nBerkshire's share of undistributed\nearnings of major investees $439 $298\nHypothetical tax on these undistributed\ninvestee earnings(4) (61) (42)\nReported operating earnings of Berkshire 478 348\nTotal look-through earnings of Berkshire $856 $604\n\n(1) Does not include shares allocable to the minority interest\nat Wesco\n(2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n(3) Excludes realized capital gains, which have been both\nrecurring and significant\n(4) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire pays\non the dividends it receives\n\nWe have told you that we expect the undistributed,\nhypothetically-taxed earnings of our investees to produce at least\nequivalent gains in Berkshire's intrinsic value. To date, we have\nfar exceeded that expectation. For example, in 1986 we bought\nthree million shares of Capital Cities/ABC for $172.50 per share\nand late last year sold one-third of that holding for $630 per\nshare. After paying 35% capital gains taxes, we realized a $297\nmillion profit from the sale. In contrast, during the eight years\nwe held these shares, the retained earnings of Cap Cities\nattributable to them - hypothetically taxed at a lower 14% in\naccordance with our look-through method - were only $152 million.\nIn other words, we paid a much larger tax bill than our lookthrough presentations to you have assumed and nonetheless realized\na gain that far exceeded the undistributed earnings allocable to\nthese shares.\n\nWe expect such pleasant outcomes to recur often in the future\nand therefore believe our look-through earnings to be a\nconservative representation of Berkshire's true economic earnings.",

    "content": "Taxes\n\nAs our Cap Cities sale emphasizes, Berkshire is a substantial\npayer of federal income taxes. In aggregate, we will pay 1993\nfederal income taxes of $390 million, about $200 million of that\nattributable to operating earnings and $190 million to realized\ncapital gains. Furthermore, our share of the 1993 federal and\nforeign income taxes paid by our investees is well over $400\nmillion, a figure you don't see on our financial statements but\nthat is nonetheless real. Directly and indirectly, Berkshire's\n1993 federal income tax payments will be about 1/2 of 1% of the total\npaid last year by all American corporations.\n\nSpeaking for our own shares, Charlie and I have absolutely no\ncomplaint about these taxes. We know we work in a market-based\neconomy that rewards our efforts far more bountifully than it does\nthe efforts of others whose output is of equal or greater benefit\nto society. Taxation should, and does, partially redress this\ninequity. But we still remain extraordinarily well-treated.\n\nBerkshire and its shareholders, in combination, would pay a\nmuch smaller tax if Berkshire operated as a partnership or \"S\"\ncorporation, two structures often used for business activities.\nFor a variety of reasons, that's not feasible for Berkshire to do.\nHowever, the penalty our corporate form imposes is mitigated -\nthough far from eliminated - by our strategy of investing for the\nlong term. Charlie and I would follow a buy-and-hold policy even\nif we ran a tax-exempt institution. We think it the soundest way\nto invest, and it also goes down the grain of our personalities. A\nthird reason to favor this policy, however, is the fact that taxes\nare due only when gains are realized.\n\nThrough my favorite comic strip, Li'l Abner, I got a chance\nduring my youth to see the benefits of delayed taxes, though I\nmissed the lesson at the time. Making his readers feel superior,\nLi'l Abner bungled happily, but moronically, through life in\nDogpatch. At one point he became infatuated with a New York\ntemptress, Appassionatta Van Climax, but despaired of marrying her\nbecause he had only a single silver dollar and she was interested\nsolely in millionaires. Dejected, Abner took his problem to Old\nMan Mose, the font of all knowledge in Dogpatch. Said the sage:\nDouble your money 20 times and Appassionatta will be yours (1,2,\n4,8 . . . . 1,048,576).\n\nMy last memory of the strip is Abner entering a roadhouse,\ndropping his dollar into a slot machine, and hitting a jackpot that\nspilled money all over the floor. Meticulously following Mose's\nadvice, Abner picked up two dollars and went off to find his next\ndouble. Whereupon I dumped Abner and began reading Ben Graham.\n\nMose clearly was overrated as a guru: Besides failing to\nanticipate Abner's slavish obedience to instructions, he also\nforgot about taxes. Had Abner been subject, say, to the 35%\nfederal tax rate that Berkshire pays, and had he managed one double\nannually, he would after 20 years only have accumulated $22,370.\nIndeed, had he kept on both getting his annual doubles and paying a\n35% tax on each, he would have needed 7 1/2 years more to reach the\n$1 million required to win Appassionatta.\n\nBut what if Abner had instead put his dollar in a single\ninvestment and held it until it doubled the same 27 1/2 times? In\nthat case, he would have realized about $200 million pre-tax or,\nafter paying a $70 million tax in the final year, about $130\nmillion after-tax. For that, Appassionatta would have crawled to\nDogpatch. Of course, with 27 1/2 years having passed, how\nAppassionatta would have looked to a fellow sitting on $130 million\nis another question.\n\nWhat this little tale tells us is that tax-paying investors\nwill realize a far, far greater sum from a single investment that\ncompounds internally at a given rate than from a succession of\ninvestments compounding at the same rate. But I suspect many\nBerkshire shareholders figured that out long ago.",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\nAt this point in the report we've customarily provided you\nwith a table showing the annual \"combined ratio\" of the insurance\nindustry for the preceding decade. This ratio compares total\ninsurance costs (losses incurred plus expenses) to revenue from\npremiums. For many years, the ratio has been above 100, a level\nindicating an underwriting loss. That is, the industry has taken\nin less money each year from its policyholders than it has had to\npay for operating expenses and for loss events that occurred during\nthe year.\n\nOffsetting this grim equation is a happier fact: Insurers get\nto hold on to their policyholders' money for a time before paying\nit out. This happens because most policies require that premiums\nbe prepaid and, more importantly, because it often takes time to\nresolve loss claims. Indeed, in the case of certain lines of\ninsurance, such as product liability or professional malpractice,\nmany years may elapse between the loss event and payment.\n\nTo oversimplify the matter somewhat, the total of the funds\nprepaid by policyholders and the funds earmarked for incurred-butnot-yet-paid claims is called \"the float.\" In the past, the\nindustry was able to suffer a combined ratio of 107 to 111 and\nstill break even from its insurance writings because of the\nearnings derived from investing this float.\n\nAs interest rates have fallen, however, the value of float has\nsubstantially declined. Therefore, the data that we have provided\nin the past are no longer useful for year-to-year comparisons of\nindustry profitability. A company writing at the same combined\nratio now as in the 1980's today has a far less attractive business\nthan it did then.\n\nOnly by making an analysis that incorporates both underwriting\nresults and the current risk-free earnings obtainable from float\ncan one evaluate the true economics of the business that a\nproperty-casualty insurer writes. Of course, the\nactual\ninvestment\nresults that an insurer achieves from the use of both float and\nstockholders' funds is also of major importance and should be\ncarefully examined when an investor is assessing managerial\nperformance. But that should be a separate analysis from the one\nwe are discussing here. The value of float funds - in effect,\ntheir transfer price as they move from the insurance operation to\nthe investment operation - should be determined simply by the riskfree, long-term rate of interest.\n\nOn the next page we show the numbers that count in an\nevaluation of Berkshire's insurance business. We calculate our\nfloat - which we generate in exceptional amounts relative to our\npremium volume - by adding loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves\nand unearned premium reserves and then subtracting agent's\nbalances, prepaid acquisition costs and deferred charges applicable\nto assumed reinsurance. Our cost of float is determined by our\nunderwriting loss or profit. In those years when we have had an\nunderwriting profit, which includes 1993, our cost of float has\nbeen negative, and we have determined our insurance earnings by\nadding underwriting profit to float income.\n\n1967 profit $ 17.3 less than zero 5.50%\n1968 profit 19.9 less than zero 5.90%\n1969 profit 23.4 less than zero 6.79%\n1970 $ 0.37 32.4 1.14% 6.25%\n1971 profit 52.5 less than zero 5.81%\n1972 profit 69.5 less than zero 5.82%\n1973 profit 73.3 less than zero 7.27%\n1974 7.36 79.1 9.30% 8.13%\n1975 11.35 87.6 12.96% 8.03%\n1976 profit 102.6 less than zero 7.30%\n1977 profit 139.0 less than zero 7.97%\n1978 profit 190.4 less than zero 8.93%\n1979 profit 227.3 less than zero 10.08%\n1980 profit 237.0 less than zero 11.94%\n1981 profit 228.4 less than zero 13.61%\n1982 21.56 220.6 9.77% 10.64%\n1983 33.87 231.3 14.64% 11.84%\n1984 48.06 253.2 18.98% 11.58%\n1985 44.23 390.2 11.34% 9.34%\n1986 55.84 797.5 7.00% 7.60%\n1987 55.43 1,266.7 4.38% 8.95%\n1988 11.08 1,497.7 0.74% 9.00%\n1989 24.40 1,541.3 1.58% 7.97%\n1990 26.65 1,637.3 1.63% 8.24%\n1991 119.59 1,895.0 6.31% 7.40%\n1992 108.96 2,290.4 4.76% 7.39%\n1993 profit 2,624.7 less than zero 6.35%",

This sounds\ngood - is good - but is far from as good as it sounds.\n\nWe temper our enthusiasm because we write a large volume of\n\"super-cat\" policies (which other insurance and reinsurance\ncompanies buy to recover part of the losses they suffer from megacatastrophes) and because last year we had no losses of consequence\nfrom this activity. As that suggests, the truly catastrophic\nMidwestern floods of 1993 did not trigger super-cat losses, the\nreason being that very few flood policies are purchased from\nprivate insurers.\n\nIt would be fallacious, however, to conclude from this singleyear result that the super-cat business is a wonderful one, or even\na satisfactory one. A simple example will illustrate the fallacy:\nSuppose there is an event that occurs 25 times in every century.\nIf you annually give 5-for-1 odds against its occurrence\nthat\nyear,\nyou will have many more winning years than losers. Indeed, you may\ngo a straight six, seven or more years without loss. You also will\neventually go broke.\n\nAt Berkshire, we naturally believe we are obtaining adequate\npremiums and giving more like 3 1/2-for-1 odds. But there is no way\nfor us - or anyone else - to calculate the true odds on super-cat\ncoverages. In fact, it will take decades for us to find out\nwhether our underwriting judgment has been sound.\n\nWhat we do know is that when a loss comes, it's likely to be a\nlulu. There may well be years when Berkshire will suffer losses\nfrom the super-cat business equal to three or four times what we\nearned from it in 1993. When Hurricane Andrew blew in 1992, we\npaid out about $125 million. Because we've since expanded our\nsuper-cat business, a similar storm today could cost us $600\nmillion.\n\nSo far, we have been lucky in 1994. As I write this letter,\nwe are estimating that our losses from the Los Angeles earthquake\nwill be nominal. But if the quake had been a 7.5 instead of a 6.8,\nit would have been a different story.\n\nBerkshire is ideally positioned to write super-cat policies.\nIn Ajit Jain, we have by far the best manager in this business.\nAdditionally, companies writing these policies need enormous\ncapital, and our net worth is ten to twenty times larger than that\nof our main competitors. In most lines of insurance, huge\nresources aren't that important: An insurer can diversify the\nrisks it writes and, if necessary, can lay off risks to reduce\nconcentration in its portfolio. That isn't possible in the supercat business. So these competitors are forced into offering far\nsmaller limits than those we can provide. Were they bolder, they\nwould run the risk that a mega-catastrophe - or a confluence of\nsmaller catastrophes - would wipe them out.\n\nOne indication of our premier strength and reputation is that\neach of the four largest reinsurance companies in the world buys\nvery significant reinsurance coverage from Berkshire. Better than\nanyone else, these giants understand that the test of a reinsurer\nis its ability and willingness to pay losses under trying\ncircumstances, not its readiness to accept premiums when things\nlook rosy.\n\nOne caution: There has recently been a substantial increase\nin reinsurance capacity. Close to $5 billion of equity capital has\nbeen raised by reinsurers, almost all of them newly-formed\nentities. Naturally these new entrants are hungry to write\nbusiness so that they can justify the projections they utilized in\nattracting capital. This new competition won't affect our 1994\noperations; we're filled up there, primarily with business written\nin 1993. But we are now seeing signs of price deterioration. If\nthis trend continues, we will resign ourselves to much-reduced\nvolume, keeping ourselves available, though, for the large,\nsophisticated buyer who requires a super-cat insurer with large\ncapacity and a sure ability to pay losses.\n\nIn other areas of our insurance business, our homestate\noperation, led by Rod Eldred; our workers' compensation business,\nheaded by Brad Kinstler; our credit-card operation, managed by the\nKizer family; and National Indemnity's traditional auto and general\nliability business, led by Don Wurster, all achieved excellent\nresults. In combination, these four units produced a significant\nunderwriting profit and substantial float.\n\nAll in all, we have a first-class insurance business. Though\nits results will be highly volatile, this operation possesses an\nintrinsic value that exceeds its book value by a large amount -\nlarger, in fact, than is the case at any other Berkshire business.",

    "content": "Common Stock Investments\n\nBelow we list our common stockholdings having a value of over\n$250 million. A small portion of these investments belongs to\nsubsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n\n12/31/93\nShares Company Cost Market\n\nConsidering the similarity of this year's list and the last,\nyou may decide your management is hopelessly comatose. But we\ncontinue to think that it is usually foolish to part with an\ninterest in a business that is both understandable and durably\nwonderful. Business interests of that kind are simply too hard to\nreplace.\n\nInterestingly, corporate managers have no trouble\nunderstanding that point when they are focusing on a business they\noperate: A parent company that owns a subsidiary with superb longterm economics is not likely to sell that entity regardless of\nprice. \"Why,\" the CEO would ask, \"should I part with my crown\njewel?\" Yet that same CEO, when it comes to running his personal\ninvestment portfolio, will offhandedly - and even impetuously -\nmove from business to business when presented with no more than\nsuperficial arguments by his broker for doing so. The worst of\nthese is perhaps, \"You can't go broke taking a profit.\" Can you\nimagine a CEO using this line to urge his board to sell a star\nsubsidiary? In our view, what makes sense in business also makes\nsense in stocks: An investor should ordinarily hold a small piece\nof an outstanding business with the same tenacity that an owner\nwould exhibit if he owned all of that business.\n\nEarlier I mentioned the financial results that could have been\nachieved by investing $40 in The Coca-Cola Co. in 1919. In 1938,\nmore than 50 years after the introduction of Coke, and long after\nthe drink was firmly established as an American icon,\nFortune\ndid\nan excellent story on the company. In the second paragraph the\nwriter reported: \"Several times every year a weighty and serious\ninvestor looks long and with profound respect at Coca-Cola's\nrecord, but comes regretfully to the conclusion that he is looking\ntoo late. The specters of saturation and competition rise before\nhim.\"\n\nYes, competition there was in 1938 and in 1993 as well. But\nit's worth noting that in 1938 The Coca-Cola Co. sold 207 million\ncases of soft drinks (if its gallonage then is converted into the\n192-ounce cases used for measurement today) and in 1993 it sold\nabout 10.7 billion cases, a 50-fold increase in physical volume\nfrom a company that in 1938 was already dominant in its very major\nindustry. Nor was the party over in 1938 for an investor: Though\nthe $40 invested in 1919 in one share had (with dividends\nreinvested) turned into $3,277 by the end of 1938, a fresh $40 then\ninvested in Coca-Cola stock would have grown to $25,000 by yearend\n1993.\n\nI can't resist one more quote from that 1938\nFortune\nstory:\n\"It would be hard to name any company comparable in size to Coca Cola and selling, as Coca-Cola does, an unchanged product that can\npoint to a ten-year record anything like Coca-Cola's.\" In the 55\nyears that have since passed, Coke's product line has broadened\nsomewhat, but it's remarkable how well that description still fits.",

That\njudgment became ever more compelling as Berkshire's capital\nmushroomed and the universe of investments that could significantly\naffect our results shrank dramatically. Therefore, we adopted a\nstrategy that required our being smart - and not too smart at that\n- only a very few times. Indeed, we'll now settle for one good\nidea a year. (Charlie says it's my turn.)\n\nThe strategy we've adopted precludes our following standard\ndiversification dogma. Many pundits would therefore say the\nstrategy must be riskier than that employed by more conventional\ninvestors. We disagree. We believe that a policy of portfolio\nconcentration may well\ndecrease\nrisk if it raises, as it should,\nboth the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business\nand the comfort-level he must feel with its economic characteristics\nbefore buying into it. In stating this opinion, we define risk,\nusing dictionary terms, as \"the possibility of loss or injury.\"\n\nAcademics, however, like to define investment \"risk\"\ndifferently, averring that it is the relative volatility of a stock\nor portfolio of stocks - that is, their volatility as compared to\nthat of a large universe of stocks. Employing data bases and\nstatistical skills, these academics compute with precision the\n\"beta\" of a stock - its relative volatility in the past - and then\nbuild arcane investment and capital-allocation theories around this\ncalculation. In their hunger for a single statistic to measure\nrisk, however, they forget a fundamental principle: It is better\nto be approximately right than precisely wrong.\n\nFor owners of a business - and that's the way we think of\nshareholders - the academics' definition of risk is far off the\nmark, so much so that it produces absurdities. For example, under\nbeta-based theory, a stock that has dropped very sharply compared\nto the market - as had Washington Post when we bought it in 1973 -\nbecomes \"riskier\" at the lower price than it was at the higher\nprice. Would that description have then made any sense to someone\nwho was offered the entire company at a vastly-reduced price?\n\nIn fact, the true investor\nwelcomes\nvolatility. Ben Graham\nexplained why in Chapter 8 of\nThe Intelligent Investor.\nThere he\nintroduced \"Mr. Market,\" an obliging fellow who shows up every day\nto either buy from you or sell to you, whichever you wish. The\nmore manic-depressive this chap is, the greater the opportunities\navailable to the investor. That's true because a wildly\nfluctuating market means that irrationally low prices will\nperiodically be attached to solid businesses. It is impossible to\nsee how the availability of such prices can be thought of as\nincreasing the hazards for an investor who is totally free to\neither ignore the market or exploit its folly.\n\nIn assessing risk, a beta purist will disdain examining what a\ncompany produces, what its competitors are doing, or how much\nborrowed money the business employs. He may even prefer not to\nknow the company's name. What he treasures is the price history of\nits stock. In contrast, we'll happily forgo knowing the price\nhistory and instead will seek whatever information will further our\nunderstanding of the company's business. After we buy a stock,\nconsequently, we would not be disturbed if markets closed for a\nyear or two. We don't need a daily quote on our 100% position in\nSee's or H. H. Brown to validate our well-being. Why, then, should\nwe need a quote on our 7% interest in Coke?",

Though this risk cannot be calculated with engineering\nprecision, it can in some cases be judged with a degree of accuracy\nthat is useful. The primary factors bearing upon this evaluation\nare:\n\n1) The certainty with which the long-term economic\ncharacteristics of the business can be evaluated;\n\n2) The certainty with which management can be evaluated,\nboth as to its ability to realize the full potential of\nthe business and to wisely employ its cash flows;\n\n3) The certainty with which management can be counted on\nto channel the rewards from the business to the\nshareholders rather than to itself;\n\n4) The purchase price of the business;\n\n5) The levels of taxation and inflation that will be\nexperienced and that will determine the degree by which\nan investor's purchasing-power return is reduced from his\ngross return.\n\nThese factors will probably strike many analysts as unbearably\nfuzzy, since they cannot be extracted from a data base of any kind.\nBut the difficulty of precisely quantifying these matters does not\nnegate their importance nor is it insuperable. Just as Justice\nStewart found it impossible to formulate a test for obscenity but\nnevertheless asserted, \"I know it when I see it,\" so also can\ninvestors - in an inexact but useful way - \"see\" the risks inherent\nin certain investments without reference to complex equations or\nprice histories.\n\nIs it really so difficult to conclude that Coca-Cola and\nGillette possess far less business risk over the long term than,\nsay,\nany\ncomputer company or retailer? Worldwide, Coke sells about\n44% of all soft drinks, and Gillette has more than a 60% share (in\nvalue) of the blade market. Leaving aside chewing gum, in which\nWrigley is dominant, I know of no other significant businesses in\nwhich the leading company has long enjoyed such global power.\n\nMoreover, both Coke and Gillette have actually increased their\nworldwide shares of market in recent years. The might of their\nbrand names, the attributes of their products, and the strength of\ntheir distribution systems give them an enormous competitive\nadvantage, setting up a protective moat around their economic\ncastles. The average company, in contrast, does battle daily\nwithout any such means of protection. As Peter Lynch says, stocks\nof companies selling commodity-like products should come with a\nwarning label: \"Competition may prove hazardous to human wealth.\"\n\nThe competitive strengths of a Coke or Gillette are obvious to\neven the casual observer of business. Yet the beta of their stocks\nis similar to that of a great many run-of-the-mill companies who\npossess little or no competitive advantage. Should we conclude\nfrom this similarity that the competitive strength of Coke and\nGillette gains them nothing when business risk is being measured?\nOr should we conclude that the risk in owning a piece of a company\n- its stock - is somehow divorced from the long-term risk inherent\nin its business operations? We believe neither conclusion makes\nsense and that equating beta with investment risk also makes no\nsense.",

But it's quite\npossible for ordinary investors to make such distinctions if they\nhave a reasonable understanding of consumer behavior and the\nfactors that create long-term competitive strength or weakness.\nObviously, every investor will make mistakes. But by confining\nhimself to a relatively few, easy-to-understand cases, a reasonably\nintelligent, informed and diligent person can judge investment\nrisks with a useful degree of accuracy.\n\nIn many industries, of course, Charlie and I can't determine\nwhether we are dealing with a \"pet rock\" or a \"Barbie.\" We\ncouldn't solve this problem, moreover, even if we were to spend\nyears intensely studying those industries. Sometimes our own\nintellectual shortcomings would stand in the way of understanding,\nand in other cases the nature of the industry would be the\nroadblock. For example, a business that must deal with fast-moving\ntechnology is not going to lend itself to reliable evaluations of\nits long-term economics. Did we foresee thirty years ago what\nwould transpire in the television-manufacturing or computer\nindustries? Of course not. (Nor did most of the investors and\ncorporate managers who enthusiastically entered those industries.)\nWhy, then, should Charlie and I now think we can predict the\nfuture of other rapidly-evolving businesses? We'll stick instead\nwith the easy cases. Why search for a needle buried in a haystack\nwhen one is sitting in plain sight?\n\nOf course, some investment strategies - for instance, our\nefforts in arbitrage over the years - require wide diversification.\nIf significant risk exists in a single transaction, overall risk\nshould be reduced by making that purchase one of many mutuallyindependent commitments. Thus, you may consciously purchase a\nrisky investment - one that indeed has a significant possibility of\ncausing loss or injury - if you believe that your gain, weighted\nfor probabilities, considerably exceeds your loss, comparably\nweighted, and if you can commit to a number of similar, but\nunrelated opportunities. Most venture capitalists employ this\nstrategy. Should you choose to pursue this course, you should\nadopt the outlook of the casino that owns a roulette wheel, which\nwill want to see lots of action because it is favored by\nprobabilities, but will refuse to accept a single, huge bet.\n\nAnother situation requiring wide diversification occurs when\nan investor who does not understand the economics of specific\nbusinesses nevertheless believes it in his interest to be a longterm owner of American industry. That investor should both own a\nlarge number of equities and space out his purchases. By\nperiodically investing in an index fund, for example, the knownothing investor can actually out-perform most investment\nprofessionals. Paradoxically, when \"dumb\" money acknowledges its\nlimitations, it ceases to be dumb.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a knowsomething\ninvestor, able\nto understand business economics and to find five to ten sensiblypriced companies that possess important long-term competitive\nadvantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you.\nIt is apt simply to hurt your results and increase your risk. I\ncannot understand why an investor of that sort elects to put money\ninto a business that is his 20 th favorite rather than simply adding\nthat money to his top choices - the businesses he understands best\nand that present the least risk, along with the greatest profit\npotential. In the words of the prophet Mae West: \"Too much of a\ngood thing can be wonderful.\"",

    "content": "Corporate Governance\n\nAt our annual meetings, someone usually asks \"What happens to\nthis place if you get hit by a truck?\" I'm glad they are still\nasking the question in this form. It won't be too long before the\nquery becomes: \"What happens to this place if you\ndon't\nget hit by\na truck?\"\n\nSuch questions, in any event, raise a reason for me to discuss\ncorporate governance, a hot topic during the past year. In\ngeneral, I believe that directors have stiffened their spines\nrecently and that shareholders are now being treated somewhat more\nlike true owners than was the case not long ago. Commentators on\ncorporate governance, however, seldom make any distinction among\nthree fundamentally different manager/owner situations that exist\nin publicly-held companies. Though the legal responsibility of\ndirectors is identical throughout, their ability to effect change\ndiffers in each of the cases. Attention usually falls on the first\ncase, because it prevails on the corporate scene. Since Berkshire\nfalls into the second category, however, and will someday fall into\nthe third, we will discuss all three variations.\n\nThe first, and by far most common, board situation is one in\nwhich a corporation has no controlling shareholder. In that case,\nI believe directors should behave as if there is a single absentee\nowner, whose long-term interest they should try to further in all\nproper ways. Unfortunately, \"long-term\" gives directors a lot of\nwiggle room. If they lack either integrity or the ability to think\nindependently, directors can do great violence to shareholders\nwhile still claiming to be acting in their long-term interest. But\nassume the board is functioning well and must deal with a\nmanagement that is mediocre or worse. Directors then have the\nresponsibility for changing that management, just as an intelligent\nowner would do if he were present. And if able but greedy managers\nover-reach and try to dip too deeply into the shareholders'\npockets, directors must slap their hands.\n\nIn this plain-vanilla case, a director who sees something he\ndoesn't like should attempt to persuade the other directors of his\nviews. If he is successful, the board will have the muscle to make\nthe appropriate change. Suppose, though, that the unhappy director\ncan't get other directors to agree with him. He should then feel\nfree to make his views known to the absentee owners. Directors\nseldom do that, of course. The temperament of many directors would\nin fact be incompatible with critical behavior of that sort. But I\nsee nothing improper in such actions, assuming the issues are\nserious. Naturally, the complaining director can expect a vigorous\nrebuttal from the unpersuaded directors, a prospect that should\ndiscourage the dissenter from pursuing trivial or non-rational\ncauses.\n\nFor the boards just discussed, I believe the directors ought\nto be relatively few in number - say, ten or less - and ought to\ncome mostly from the outside. The outside board members should\nestablish standards for the CEO's performance and should also\nperiodically meet, without his being present, to evaluate his\nperformance against those standards.",

    "content": "The requisites for board membership should be business savvy,\ninterest in the job, and owner-orientation. Too often, directors\nare selected simply because they are prominent or add diversity to\nthe board. That practice is a mistake. Furthermore, mistakes in\nselecting directors are particularly serious because appointments\nare so hard to undo: The pleasant but vacuous director need never\nworry about job security.\n\nThe second case is that existing at Berkshire, where the\ncontrolling owner is also the manager. At some companies, this\narrangement is facilitated by the existence of two classes of stock\nendowed with disproportionate voting power. In these situations,\nit's obvious that the board does not act as an agent between owners\nand management and that the directors cannot effect change except\nthrough persuasion. Therefore, if the owner/manager is mediocre or\nworse - or is over-reaching - there is little a director can do\nabout it except object. If the directors having no connections to\nthe owner/manager make a unified argument, it may well have some\neffect. More likely it will not.\n\nIf change does not come, and the matter is sufficiently\nserious, the outside directors should resign. Their resignation\nwill signal their doubts about management, and it will emphasize\nthat no outsider is in a position to correct the owner/manager's\nshortcomings.\n\nThe third governance case occurs when there is a controlling\nowner who is not involved in management. This case, examples of\nwhich are Hershey Foods and Dow Jones, puts the outside directors\nin a potentially useful position. If they become unhappy with\neither the competence or integrity of the manager, they can go\ndirectly to the owner (who may also be on the board) and report\ntheir dissatisfaction. This situation is ideal for an outside\ndirector, since he need make his case only to a single, presumably\ninterested owner, who can forthwith effect change if the argument\nis persuasive. Even so, the dissatisfied director has only that\nsingle course of action. If he remains unsatisfied about a\ncritical matter, he has no choice but to resign.\n\nLogically, the third case should be the most effective in\ninsuring first-class management. In the second case the owner is\nnot going to fire himself, and in the first case, directors often\nfind it very difficult to deal with mediocrity or mild overreaching. Unless the unhappy directors can win over a majority of\nthe board - an awkward social and logistical task, particularly if\nmanagement's behavior is merely odious, not egregious - their hands\nare effectively tied. In practice, directors trapped in situations\nof this kind usually convince themselves that by staying around\nthey can do at least some good. Meanwhile, management proceeds\nunfettered.\n\nIn the third case, the owner is neither judging himself nor\nburdened with the problem of garnering a majority. He can also\ninsure that outside directors are selected who will bring useful\nqualities to the board. These directors, in turn, will know that\nthe good advice they give will reach the right ears, rather than\nbeing stifled by a recalcitrant management. If the controlling\nowner is intelligent and self-confident, he will make decisions in\nrespect to management that are meritocratic and pro-shareholder.\nMoreover - and this is critically important - he can readily\ncorrect any mistake he makes.\n\nAt Berkshire we operate in the second mode now and will for as\nlong as I remain functional. My health, let me add, is excellent.\nFor better or worse, you are likely to have me as an owner/manager\nfor some time.\n\nAfter my death, all of my stock will go to my wife, Susie,\nshould she survive me, or to a foundation if she dies before I do.\nIn neither case will taxes and bequests require the sale of\nconsequential amounts of stock.\n\nWhen my stock is transferred to either my wife or the\nfoundation, Berkshire will enter the third governance mode, going\nforward with a vitally interested, but non-management, owner and\nwith a management that must perform for that owner. In preparation\nfor that time, Susie was elected to the board a few years ago, and\nin 1993 our son, Howard, joined the board. These family members\nwill not be managers of the company in the future, but they will\nrepresent the controlling interest should anything happen to me.\nMost of our other directors are also significant owners of\nBerkshire stock, and each has a strong owner-orientation. All in\nall, we're prepared for \"the truck.\"",

    "content": "Shareholder-Designated Contributions\n\nAbout 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1993 shareholder-designated contributions program. Contributions\nmade through the program were $9.4 million and 3,110 charities were\nrecipients.\n\nBerkshire's practice in respect to discretionary philanthropy\n- as contrasted to its policies regarding contributions that are\nclearly related to the company's business activities - differs\nsignificantly from that of other publicly-held corporations.\nThere, most corporate contributions are made pursuant to the wishes\nof the CEO (who often will be responding to social pressures),\nemployees (through matching gifts), or directors (through matching\ngifts or requests they make of the CEO).\n\nAt Berkshire, we believe that the company's money is the\nowners' money, just as it would be in a closely-held corporation,\npartnership, or sole proprietorship. Therefore, if funds are to be\ngiven to causes unrelated to Berkshire's business activities, it is\nthe charities favored by our owners that should receive them.\nWe've yet to find a CEO who believes he should personally fund the\ncharities favored by his shareholders. Why, then, should they foot\nthe bill for his picks?\n\nLet me add that our program is easy to administer. Last fall,\nfor two months, we borrowed one person from National Indemnity to\nhelp us implement the instructions that came from our 7,500\nregistered shareholders. I'd guess that the average corporate\nprogram in which employee gifts are matched incurs far greater\nadministrative costs. Indeed, our entire corporate overhead is\nless than half the size of our charitable contributions.\n(Charlie,\nhowever, insists that I tell you that $1.4 million of our $4.9 million overhead is\nattributable to our corporate jet, The Indefensible.)\n\nBelow is a list showing the largest categories to which our\nshareholders have steered their contributions.\n\n(a) 347 churches and synagogues received 569 gifts\n(b) 283 colleges and universities received 670 gifts\n(c) 244 K-12 schools (about two-thirds secular, onethird religious) received 525 gifts\n(d) 288 institutions dedicated to art, culture or the\nhumanities received 447 gifts\n(e) 180 religious social-service organizations (split\nabout equally between Christian and Jewish) received\n411 gifts\n(f) 445 secular social-service organizations (about 40%\nyouth-related) received 759 gifts\n(g) 153 hospitals received 261 gifts\n(h) 186 health-related organizations (American Heart\nAssociation, American Cancer Society, etc.) received\n320 gifts\n\nThree things about this list seem particularly interesting to\nme. First, to some degree it indicates what people choose to give\nmoney to when they are acting of their own accord, free of pressure\nfrom solicitors or emotional appeals from charities. Second, the\ncontributions programs of publicly-held companies almost never\nallow gifts to churches and synagogues, yet clearly these\ninstitutions are what many shareholders would like to support.\nThird, the gifts made by our shareholders display conflicting\nphilosophies: 130 gifts were directed to organizations that\nbelieve in making abortions readily available for women and 30\ngifts were directed to organizations (other than churches) that\ndiscourage or are opposed to abortion.\n\nLast year I told you that I was thinking of raising the amount\nthat Berkshire shareholders can give under our designatedcontributions program and asked for your comments. We received a\nfew well-written letters opposing the entire idea, on the grounds\nthat it was our job to run the business and not our job to force\nshareholders into making charitable gifts. Most of the\nshareholders responding, however, noted the tax efficiency of the\nplan and urged us to increase the designated amount. Several\nshareholders who have given stock to their children or\ngrandchildren told me that they consider the program a particularly\ngood way to get youngsters thinking at an early age about the\nsubject of giving. These people, in other words, perceive the\nprogram to be an educational, as well as philanthropic, tool. The\nbottom line is that we did raise the amount in 1993, from $8 per\nshare to $10.\n\nIn addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that\nBerkshire distributes, our operating businesses make contributions,\nincluding merchandise, averaging about $2.5 million annually.\nThese contributions support local charities, such as The United\nWay, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our businesses.\n\nWe suggest that new shareholders read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages\n50-51.\nTo participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so\nregistered on August 31,1994 will be ineligible for the 1994\nprogram.",

That was a day on\nwhich the store was scheduled to be open in the evening. Mrs. B,\nwho works seven days a week, for however many hours the store\noperates, found the proper decision quite obvious: She simply\npostponed her party until an evening when the store was closed.\n\nMrs. B's story is well-known but worth telling again. She\ncame to the United States 77 years ago, unable to speak English and\ndevoid of formal schooling. In 1937, she founded the Nebraska\nFurniture Mart with $500. Last year the store had sales of $200\nmillion, a larger amount by far than that recorded by any other\nhome furnishings store in the United States. Our part in all of\nthis began ten years ago when Mrs. B sold control of the business\nto Berkshire Hathaway, a deal we completed without obtaining\naudited financial statements, checking real estate records, or\ngetting any warranties. In short, her word was good enough for us.\n\nNaturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs. B's birthday party.\nAfter all, she's promised to attend\nmy\n100 th.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nKatharine Graham retired last year as the chairman of The\nWashington Post Company, having relinquished the CEO title three\nyears ago. In 1973, we purchased our stock in her company for\nabout $10 million. Our holding now garners $7 million a year in\ndividends and is worth over $400 million. At the time of our\npurchase, we knew that the economic prospects of the company were\ngood. But equally important, Charlie and I concluded that Kay\nwould prove to be an outstanding manager and would treat all\nshareholders honorably. That latter consideration was particularly\nimportant because The Washington Post Company has two classes of\nstock, a structure that we've seen some managers abuse.\n\nAll of our judgments about this investment have been validated\nby events. Kay's skills as a manager were underscored this past\nyear when she was elected by\nFortune's\nBoard of Editors to the\nBusiness Hall of Fame. On behalf of our shareholders, Charlie and\nI had long ago put her in Berkshire's Hall of Fame.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAnother of last year's retirees was Don Keough of Coca-Cola,\nalthough, as he puts it, his retirement lasted \"about 14 hours.\"\nDon is one of the most extraordinary human beings I've ever known -\na man of enormous business talent, but, even more important, a man\nwho brings out the absolute best in everyone lucky enough to\nassociate with him. Coca-Cola wants its product to be present at\nthe happy times of a person's life. Don Keough, as an individual,\ninvariably increases the happiness of those around him. It's\nimpossible to think about Don without feeling good.\n\nI will edge up to how I met Don by slipping in a plug for my\nneighborhood in Omaha: Though Charlie has lived in California for\n45 years, his home as a boy was about 200 feet away from the house\nwhere I now live; my wife, Susie, grew up 1 1/2 blocks away; and we\nhave about 125 Berkshire shareholders in the zip code. As for Don,\nin 1958 he bought the house directly across the street from mine.\nHe was then a coffee salesman with a big family and a small income.",

    "content": "The Annual Meeting\n\nThis year the Annual Meeting will be held at the Orpheum\nTheater in downtown Omaha at 9: 30 a. m. on Monday, April 25,1994.\nA record 2,200 people turned up for the meeting last year, but the\ntheater can handle many more. We will have a display in the lobby\nfeaturing many of our consumer products - candy, spray guns, shoes,\ncutlery, encyclopedias, and the like. Among my favorites slated to\nbe there is a See's candy assortment that commemorates Mrs. B's\n100 th birthday and that features her picture, rather than Mrs.\nSee's, on the package.\n\nWe recommend that you promptly get hotel reservations at one\nof these hotels: (1) The Radisson-Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms)\nbut nice hotel across the street from the Orpheum; (2) the much\nlarger Red Lion Hotel, located about a five-minute walk from the\nOrpheum; or (3) the Marriott, located in West Omaha about 100 yards\nfrom Borsheim's, which is a twenty-minute drive from downtown. We\nwill have buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8: 30 and 8: 45\nfor the meeting and return after it ends.\n\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. With\nthe admission card, we will enclose information about parking\nfacilities located near the Orpheum. If you are driving, come a\nlittle early. Nearby lots fill up quickly and you may have to walk\na few blocks.\n\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture\nMart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you from there to\ndowntown hotels or the airport later. Those of you arriving early\ncan visit the Furniture Mart any day of the week; it is open from\n10 a. m. to 5: 30 p. m. on Saturdays and from noon to 5: 30 p. m. on\nSundays. Borsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open\nfor shareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p. m. on Sunday,\nApril 24.\n\nIn past trips to Borsheim's, many of you have met Susan\nJacques. Early in 1994, Susan was made President and CEO of the\ncompany, having risen in 11 years from a $4-an-hour job that she\ntook at the store when she was 23. Susan will be joined at\nBorsheim's on Sunday by many of the managers of our other\nbusinesses, and Charlie and I will be there as well.\n\nOn the previous evening, Saturday, April 23, there will be a\nbaseball game at Rosenblatt Stadium between the Omaha Royals and\nthe Nashville Sounds (which could turn out to be Michael Jordan's\nteam). As you may know, a few years ago I bought 25% of the Royals\n(a capital-allocation decision for which I will not become famous)\nand this year the league has cooperatively scheduled a home stand\nat Annual Meeting time.\n\nI will throw the first pitch on the 23 rd, and it's a certainty\nthat I will improve on last year's humiliating performance. On\nthat occasion, the catcher inexplicably called for my \"sinker\" and\nI dutifully delivered a pitch that barely missed my foot. This\nyear, I will go with my high hard one regardless of what the\ncatcher signals, so bring your speed-timing devices. The proxy\nstatement will include information about obtaining tickets to the\ngame. I regret to report that you won't have to buy them from\nscalpers.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 1,1994 Chairman of the Board",
