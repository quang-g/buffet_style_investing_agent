What counts, of course, is per- share intrinsic value. But that’s a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (An extended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108. Those principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge newand prospective shareholders to readthem.)

TheYearatBerkshire On the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year – in certain cases very well. Letmecounttheways: Š We completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $18 billion to purchase all of NV Energy and a majorinterestinH.J.Heinz.Bothcompaniesfituswellandwillbeprosperingacenturyfromnow. With the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire in futureacquisitionsofsize.Here,weteamedupwithinvestorsat3GCapital,afirmledbymyfriend,Jorge Paulo Lemann. His talented associates – Bernardo Hees, Heinz’s new CEO, and Alex Behring, its Chairman–areresponsibleforoperations. * All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thofthoseshownforA. Berkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $8 billion of Heinz preferred stock that carries a9%couponbutalsopossessesotherfeaturesthatshouldincreasethepreferred’sannualreturnto 12%orso.Berkshireand3GeachpurchasedhalfoftheHeinzcommonstockfor$4.25billion. Though the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a “private equity” transaction, there is a crucial difference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buy more, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, and we might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that it would be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at an equityvaluationappropriatetothetime). Our partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minor earnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time charges incurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $1.3 billion. Earnings in 2014 willbesubstantial. With Heinz, Berkshire now owns 81⁄ 2 companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in the Fortune500.Only4911⁄ 2togo. NVEnergy,purchasedfor$5.6billionbyMidAmericanEnergy,ourutilitysubsidiary,supplieselectricity to about 88% of Nevada’s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utility operation andoffersmanypossibilities forlargeinvestments inrenewableenergy.NVEnergywillnotbe MidAmerican’slastmajoracquisition. Š MidAmerican is one of our “Powerhouse Five” – a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, in aggregate, had a record $10.8 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $758 million from 2012. The other companiesinthissaintedgroupareBNSF,Iscar,LubrizolandMarmon. Of the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine years ago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased the numberoutstandingby6.1%.Inotherwords,the$10.4billiongaininannualearningsdeliveredBerkshire bythefivecompaniesoverthenine-yearspanhasbeenaccompaniedbyonlyminordilution.Thatsatisfies ourgoalofnotsimplygrowing,butratherincreasingper-shareresults. If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improvealso–perhapsby$1billionorsopre-tax. Š Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $4.7 billion pre-tax last year, up from $3.9 billionin2012.Here,too,weexpectfurthergainsin2014. Š Berkshire’sextensiveinsuranceoperationagainoperatedatanunderwritingprofitin2013–thatmakes11 yearsinarow–andincreaseditsfloat.Duringthat11-yearstretch,ourfloat–moneythatdoesn’tbelong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – has grown from $41 billion to $77 billion. Concurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $22 billion pre-tax, including $3 billion realized in 2013.Andallofthisallbeganwithour1967purchaseofNationalIndemnityfor$8.6million. We now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurer Berkshire acquired infull atyearend1995(havingformanyyears prior ownedapartialinterest).

Š WhileCharlieandIsearchforelephants,ourmanysubsidiariesareregularlymakingbolt-onacquisitions. Last year, we contracted for 25 of these, scheduled to cost $3.1 billion in aggregate. These transactions rangedfrom$1.9millionto$1.1billioninsize. Charlie and I encourage these deals. They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and more earningsforyou.Manymoreofthesebolt-ondealswillbemadeinfutureyears.Inaggregate,theywillbe meaningful. Š Last year we invested $3.5 billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in two wonderfulbusinessesthatwealreadycontrolled.Inonecase–Marmon–ourpurchasesbroughtustothe 100% ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance – Iscar – the Wertheimer family elected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the 20% of the business it retained when we bought controlin2006. Thesepurchasesaddedabout$300millionpre-taxtoourcurrentearningpowerandalsodeliveredus$800 million of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year’s letter required that we enter these purchases on our books at $1.8 billion less than we paid, a process that reducedBerkshire’sbookvalue.(Thechargewasmadeto“capitalinexcessofparvalue”;figurethatone out.) This weird accounting, you should understand, instantly increased Berkshire’s excess of intrinsic valueoverbookvaluebythesame$1.8billion.

Todd and Ted have also created significant value for you in several matters unrelated to their portfolio activities.Theircontributionsarejustbeginning:BothmenhaveBerkshirebloodintheirveins. Š Berkshire’s yearend employment – counting Heinz – totaled a record 330,745, up 42,283 from last year. The increase, I must admit, included one person at our Omaha home office. (Don’t panic: The headquartersgangstillfitscomfortablyononefloor.) Š Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasing our ownership to 9.2% versus 8.7% at yearend 2012) and IBM (6.3% versus 6.0%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca- Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1% and our interest in American Express from 13.7% to 14.2%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire’s share of their annual earningsby$50million. The four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business; it’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope diamondthantoownallofarhinestone.

The earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their ownstock –a move thatenhancesourshareoffutureearnings–aswellasforfundingbusinessopportunitiesthatusuallyturn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees will grow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, our unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $39 billion at yearend.) Our flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled businesses–givesusasignificantadvantageovercompaniesthatlimitthemselvestoacquisitionstheycan operate.

At the time, I called the transaction an “all-in wager on the economic future of the United States.” That kind of commitment was nothing new for us: We’ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett PartnershipLtd.acquiredcontrolofBerkshirein1965.Forgoodreason,too.CharlieandIhavealwaysconsidered a“bet”onever-risingU.S.prosperitytobeveryclosetoasurething.

With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition.Wewillalsotrytomaximizeresultsforyoubyrarely,ifever,issuingBerkshireshares.

IntrinsicBusinessValue As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the three elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsicvalue.Thatdiscussionisreproducedinfullonpages109-110. Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased 13.6% to $129,253andourpre-taxearningsfrombusinessesotherthaninsuranceandinvestmentsincreased12.8%to$9,116 pershare. Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.3% compounded annually, and our earnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in bothsectors,butwewillmoststronglyfocusonbuildingoperatingearnings. ************ Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations.

Insurance “Ourinvestmentintheinsurancecompaniesreflectsafirstmajorstepinoureffortstoachieveamore diversifiedbaseofearningpower.” —1967AnnualReport Let’slookfirst atinsurance, Berkshire’s coreoperation andtheenginethathasconsistently propelledour expansionsincethat1967reportwaspublished. Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect- now,pay-latermodelleavesP/Ccompaniesholdinglargesums–moneywecall“float”–thatwilleventuallygoto others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently,asourbusinessgrows,sodoesourfloat.Andhowwehavegrown,asthefollowingtableshows: Year Float(in$millions) 1970 $ 39 1980 237 1990 1,632 2000 27,871 2010 65,832 2013 77,240 Furthergainsinfloatwillbetoughtoachieve.Ontheplusside,GEICO’sfloatwillalmostcertainlygrow. In National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual – at the outside no morethan3%inanyyear.Thenatureofourinsurancecontractsissuchthatwecanneverbesubjecttoimmediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurance differsinanimportantwayfromcertainformsoflifeinsurance.) If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money–and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit. Unfortunately,thewishofallinsurerstoachievethishappyresultcreatesintensecompetition,sovigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect,iswhattheindustrypaystoholditsfloat.Forexample,StateFarm,byfarthecountry’slargestinsureranda well-managedcompanybesides,incurredanunderwritinglossinnineofthetwelveyearsendingin2012(thelatest year for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry – despite the float income all companies enjoy – will continue its dismal record of earning subnormalreturnsascomparedtootherbusinesses. As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eleven consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $22 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers who knowthatwhilefloatisvaluable,itcanbedrownedbypoorunderwritingresults. Sohowdoesourfloataffectintrinsicvalue?WhenBerkshire’sbookvalueiscalculated,thefullamountof ourfloatisdeductedasaliability,justasifwehadtopayitouttomorrowandcouldnotreplenishit.Buttothinkof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, wepay old claims – some $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 – and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Acounterpart tothisoverstated liability is$15.5billionof“goodwill”thatisattributable toourinsurance companiesandincludedinbookvalueasanasset.Inverylargepart,thisgoodwillrepresentsthepricewepaidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. Thecost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on itstruevalue.Forexample,ifaninsurancebusinesssustainslargeandprolongedunderwritinglosses,anygoodwill assetcarriedonthebooksshouldbedeemedvalueless,whateveritsoriginalcost. Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill – what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar quality to that we have – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a hugereason–whywebelieveBerkshire’sintrinsicbusinessvaluesubstantiallyexceedsitsbookvalue. ************ Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplinedoperationsthatpossessstrong,hard-to-replicatebusinessmodels.Letmetellyouaboutthemajorunits. First byfloat sizeistheBerkshire HathawayReinsurance Group,managedbyAjitJain.Ajitinsures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on.His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that areinappropriateinrelationtoourresources.Indeed,wearefarmoreconservativeinavoidingriskthanmostlarge insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega- catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. And we would remain awash in cash, looking for large opportunities if the catastrophe caused markets to go into shock. All other major insurers and reinsurerswouldmeanwhilebefarinthered,withsomefacinginsolvency. From a standing start in 1985,Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $37billion andalarge cumulative underwriting profit, a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. Ajit’s mind is an idea factorythatisalwayslookingformorelinesofbusinesshecanaddtohiscurrentassortment. One venture materialized last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly accepted by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. These professionals recognize that no other insurer can match the financial strength of Berkshire, which guarantees that legitimate claims arising manyyearsinthefuture willbepaidpromptlyandfully. BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance world. Peter has assembled a spectacular team that is already writing a substantial amount of business with many Fortune500companiesandwithsmalleroperationsaswell.BHSIwillbeamajorassetforBerkshire,onethatwill generatevolumeinthebillionswithinafewyears.GivePeteraBerkshiregreetingwhenyouseehimattheannual meeting. ************ WehaveanotherreinsurancepowerhouseinGeneralRe,managedbyTadMontross.

It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems that caused commentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. GeneralReisnowagem. ************ Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 63 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely,whojoinedthecompanyat18andcompleted52yearsofservicein2013.TonybecameCEOin1993,and sincethenthecompanyhasbeenflying. When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the companyenjoyedcomparedtotheexpensesbornebythegiantsoftheindustry.Thatoperationalefficiencycontinues today and is an all-important asset. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But almost everyone likes to drive. The insuranceneededisamajorexpenditureformostfamilies.Savingsmattertothem–andonlyalow-costoperationcan deliverthese. GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after year. Its low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross.

The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises to paymoneyinthefutureifcertaineventsoccur. Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their 20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay – even if economic chaos prevails when paymenttimearrives–isall-important. Berkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world’s largest and most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long- livedliabilities,particularlythoseinvolvingasbestosclaims.Thatis,theseinsurerswishedto“cede”theirliabilities toareinsurer.Choosingthewrongreinsurer,however–onethatdowntheroadprovedtobefinanciallystrappedor abadactor–wouldputtheoriginalinsurerindangerofgettingtheliabilitiesrightbackinitslap. Almost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest such transaction ever recorded, Lloyd’s in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising from policieswrittenbefore1993andanunknownbuthugenumberofclaimsfromthatsameperiodsuretomaterialize inthefuture.(Yes,wewillbereceivingclaimsdecadesfromnowthatapplytoeventstakingplacepriorto1993.) Berkshire’sultimatepaymentsarisingfromtheLloyd’stransactionaretodayunknowable.Whatiscertain, however, is that Berkshire will pay all valid claims up to the $15 billion limit of our policy. No other insurer’s promise would have given Lloyd’s the comfort provided by its agreement with Berkshire. The CEO of the entity then handling Lloyd’s claims said it best: “Names [the original insurers at Lloyd’s] wanted to sleep easy at night, andwethinkwe’vejustboughtthemtheworld’sbestmattress.” ************ Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models possessing wide moats form something unique in the insurance world. The combination is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders thatwillonlygetmorevaluablewithtime. Regulated,Capital-IntensiveBusinesses “Thoughtherearemanyregulatoryrestraintsintheutilityindustry,it’spossiblethatwewillmake additionalcommitmentsinthefield.Ifwedo,theamountsinvolvedcouldbelarge.” —1999AnnualReport We have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that share important characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and splitouttheircombinedfinancialstatisticsinourGAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement. A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these partially fundedbylarge amounts oflong-term debtthatisnotguaranteed byBerkshire. Ourcredit isinfact not needed because each company has earning power that even underterrible economic conditions willfarexceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’sinterest coverage was9:1. (Our definition of coverage is pre-taxearnings/interest,notEBITDA/interest,acommonly-usedmeasureweviewasseriouslyflawed.) At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances. Thefirst iscommontoallutilities: recession-resistant earnings, whichresultfromthesecompanies exclusively offering anessential service. Thesecondisenjoyedbyfewotherutilities: agreatdiversityofearnings streams, whichshield usfrom beingseriously harmed byanysingle regulatory body.Now,withtheacquisition of NV Energy, MidAmerican’s earnings base has further broadened. This particular strength, supplemented by Berkshire’s ownership, has enabled MidAmerican and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt.Thisadvantagebenefitsbothusandourcustomers.

We are not, however, resting: BNSF spent $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, double its depreciation charge and a single-year record for any railroad. And, we will spend considerably more in 2014.

I won’t explainall of the adjustments –some are tinyandarcane–butseriousinvestorsshouldunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value.

Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the purchase price is excessive. We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector.

This tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an explosion in farm prices, caused bya widespread belief that runaway inflation was coming and fueled bythelendingpolicies ofsmall rural banks. Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated both leveraged farmers and their lenders. Five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed in that bubble’s aftermath than in our recent GreatRecession. In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me $280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothing aboutoperatingafarm.ButIhaveasonwholovesfarmingandIlearnedfromhimbothhowmanybushelsofcorn and soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, I calculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about 10%.Ialsothoughtitwaslikely thatproductivity wouldimproveovertimeandthatcroppriceswouldmovehigheraswell.Bothexpectationsprovedout. I needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and potentially hadsubstantialupside.Therewould,ofcourse,betheoccasionalbadcropandpriceswouldsometimes disappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under any pressure to sell the property. Now,28years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and isworthfivetimes ormore whatIpaid.Istillknownothingaboutfarmingandrecentlymadejustmysecondvisittothefarm. In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon’s landlord when I was the company’s CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. was selling.Again,abubblehadpopped–thisoneinvolvingcommercialrealestate–andtheRTChadbeencreatedto disposeoftheassetsoffailedsavingsinstitutionswhoseoptimisticlendingpracticeshadfueledthefolly.

The property’s location was also superb:NYUwasn’tgoinganywhere. I joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that purchased the parcel. Fred was an experienced, high-grade real estateinvestorwho,withhisfamily,wouldmanagetheproperty.Andmanageitthey did. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our original equity investment.Moreover,ouroriginalmortgagewasrefinancedin1996andagainin1999,movesthatallowedseveral specialdistributionstotalingmorethan150%ofwhatwehadinvested.I’veyettoviewtheproperty. IncomefromboththefarmandtheNYUrealestatewillprobablyincreaseinthedecadestocome.Though the gains won’t be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and, subsequently,formychildrenandgrandchildren. Itellthesetalestoillustratecertainfundamentalsofinvesting: Š You don’t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns.

Games are won by players who focus on the playing field – not by those whoseeyesaregluedtothescoreboard.IfyoucanenjoySaturdaysandSundayswithoutlookingatstock prices,giveitatryonweekdays. Š Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time. Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hear TV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle’s scathingcomment:“Youdon’tknowhoweasythisgameisuntilyougetintothatbroadcastingbooth.”) Š My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock market might do in the years immediately following – 1987 and 1994 – was of no importance to me in making those investments. I can’t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever the chatter,cornwouldkeepgrowinginNebraskaandstudentswouldflocktoNYU. There is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocks provideyouminute-to-minutevaluationsforyourholdingswhereasIhaveyettoseeaquotationforeithermyfarm ortheNewYorkrealestate. It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations placed on their holdings – and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my propertyyelledoutapriceeverydaytomeatwhichhewouldeitherbuymyfarmorsellmehis–andthoseprices varied widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state – how in the world could I be other than benefited by his erratic behavior?

Ownersofstocks,however,toooftenletthecapriciousandoftenirrationalbehavioroftheirfellowowners cause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits – and, worse yet, importanttoconsideractingupontheircomments. Thosepeoplewhocansitquietlyfordecadeswhentheyownafarmorapartmenthousetoooftenbecome frenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering an implied message of “Don’t just sit there, do something.” For these investors, liquidity is transformed from the unqualifiedbenefititshouldbetoacurse.

Most investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise, theywillconcludethattheydonotknowenoughaboutspecificbusinessestopredicttheirfutureearningpower. I have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn’t need this skill. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts). In the 20th Century, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497, paying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21st Century will witness further gains, almost certain to be substantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners – neither he nor his “helpers” can do that–butshouldrather betoownacross-section ofbusinesses that inaggregate areboundtodowell.Alow-cost S&P500indexfundwillachievethisgoal. That’sthe“what”ofinvestingforthenon-professional.The“when”isalsoimportant.Themaindangeris that the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then become disillusionedwhenpaperlossesoccur.(RememberthelateBartonBiggs’observation:“Abullmarketislikesex.It feelsbestjustbeforeitends.”)Theantidotetothatkindofmistimingisforaninvestortoaccumulatesharesovera long period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the “know-nothing” investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long- termresultsthantheknowledgeableprofessionalwhoisblindtoevenasingleweakness. If “investors” frenetically bought and sold farmland to each other, neither the yields nor prices of their crops would be increased. The only consequence of such behavior would be decreases in the overall earnings realized by the farm-owning population because of the substantial costs it would incur as it sought advice and switchedproperties. Nevertheless, both individuals and institutions will constantly be urged to be active by those who profit from giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors in aggregate,devoidofbenefit.Soignorethechatter,keepyourcostsminimal,andinvestinstocksasyouwouldina farm. My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’s benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations overthetenyearsfollowing theclosing ofmyestate.) Myadvicetothetrustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-fee managers. ************ And now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben’s bookTheIntelligentInvestor,whichIboughtin1949.Myfinanciallifechangedwiththatpurchase. Before reading Ben’s book,Ihadwanderedaroundtheinvesting landscape, devouring everything written onthesubject.MuchofwhatIreadfascinatedme:Itriedmyhandatchartingandatusingmarketindiciatopredict stock movements. I sat in brokerage offices watching the tape roll by, and I listened to commentators. All of this wasfun,butIcouldn’tshakethefeelingthatIwasn’tgettinganywhere. In contrast, Ben’s ideas were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greek lettersorcomplicatedformulas).Forme,thekeypointswerelaidoutinwhatlatereditionslabeledChapters8and 20.(Theoriginal1949editionnumbereditschaptersdifferently.)Thesepointsguidemyinvestingdecisionstoday. A couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing an unnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the first editionand–braceyourself–themysterycompanywasGEICO.IfBenhadnotrecognizedthespecialqualitiesof GEICOwhenitwasstillinitsinfancy,myfutureandBerkshire’swouldhavebeenfardifferent.

Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pension mathematicstodayremainamysterytomostAmericans. Investment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to KatharineGraham,thenchairmanofTheWashingtonPostCompany,aboutthepitfallsofpensionpromisesandthe importanceofinvestmentpolicy.Thatmemoisreproducedonpages118-136.

They are truly All- Stars, whorun their businesses as if they were the only asset ownedbytheir families.

Most havenofinancialneedtowork;thejoyofhittingbusiness“homeruns”meansasmuchtothemastheirpaycheck. Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office.
