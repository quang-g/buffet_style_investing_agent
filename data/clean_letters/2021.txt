One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated transactions and never occurs en masse. It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the marketablearena. Surprise,Surprise Hereareafewitemsaboutyourcompanythatoftensurpriseevenseasonedinvestors: • Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth, Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet as property, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That supremacyhasneverbeenourgoal.Ithas,however,becomeafact. At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion. Thatnumberincreasedlastyearandwillcontinuetoincrease.Berkshirealwayswillbebuilding. • Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid $3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion. Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailable assertionwhenmadebyBerkshireshareholders. Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between government and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning and HathawayManufacturingagreedtomergetheirbusinesses.Intheirrequestsforshareholderapproval,these venerableNewEnglandtextilecompaniesexpressedhighhopesforthecombination. TheHathawaysolicitation,forexample,assureditsshareholdersthat“Thecombinationoftheresourcesand managementswillresultinoneofthestrongestandmostefficientorganizationsinthetextileindustry.”That upbeatviewwasendorsedbythecompany’sadvisor,LehmanBrothers(yes,thatLehmanBrothers). I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union wasconsummated.Afterthebandsstoppedplayingandthebankerswenthome,however,theshareholders reapedadisaster. In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from $51.4million to $22.1million. In part, this decline wascausedbystockrepurchases, ill-advised dividends andplantshutdowns.Butnineyearsofeffortbymanythousandsofemployeesdeliveredanoperatingloss as well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered an extendedandnon-reversibledeathmarch. Duringtheninepost-mergeryears,theU.S.TreasurysufferedaswellfromBerkshire’stroubles.Alltold,the companypaidthegovernmentonly$337,359inincometaxduringthatperiod–apathetic$100perday. Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and steeredessentiallyallearningsintoavarietyofgoodbusinesses,mostofwhichremainedgoodthroughthe years.Couplingreinvestmentofearningswiththepowerofcompoundingworkeditsmagic,andshareholders prospered. Berkshire’sowners,itshouldbenoted,werenottheonlybeneficiaryofthatcoursecorrection.Their“silent partner,”theU.S.Treasury,proceededtocollectmanytensofbillionsofdollarsfromthecompanyinincome taxpayments.Rememberthe$100daily?Now,Berkshirepaysroughly$9milliondailytotheTreasury. In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the fact that Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our countrywouldhavedonesplendidlyintheyearssince1965withoutBerkshire.AbsentourAmericanhome, however,Berkshirewouldneverhavecomeclosetobecomingwhatitistoday.Whenyouseetheflag,say thanks. • From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in insurance“float”–moneyweholdandcaninvestbutthatdoesnotbelongtous.Includingarelativelysmall sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the insurancebusinessto$147billion. Sofar,thisfloathascostuslessthannothing.Thoughwehaveexperiencedanumberofyearswheninsurance losses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year profitfromtheunderwritingactivitiesthatgeneratedourfloat. Ofequalimportance,floatisverysticky.Fundsattributabletoourinsuranceoperationscomeandgodaily, but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we can thereforethinklong-term.

OurFourGiants Through Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a collection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations, rangingfromtheleasingofrailroadcarstothemanufactureofmedicaldevices. • Nevertheless,operationsofour“BigFour”companiesaccountforaverylargechunkofBerkshire’svalue. Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massive floatvalueweearlierdescribed.Theinvestedassetsoftheseinsurersarefurtherenlargedbytheextraordinary amountofcapitalweinvesttobackuptheirpromises.

ShareRepurchases Therearethreewaysthatwecanincreasethevalueofyourinvestment.Thefirstisalwaysfrontandcenter inourminds:Increasethelong-term earningpowerofBerkshire’s controlled businessesthroughinternalgrowthor by making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of those opportunities,however,issmallcomparedtoBerkshire’sresources. Our second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are publicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, we findlittlethatexcitesus. That’s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of all productive investments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influence valuationsaswell,butinterestrateswillalwaysbeimportant. OurfinalpathtovaluecreationistorepurchaseBerkshireshares.Throughthatsimpleact,weincreaseyour shareofthemanycontrolledandnon-controlledbusinessesBerkshireowns.Whentheprice/valueequationisright, this path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value to continuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of the repurchasedsharesandtosocietyaswell.) Periodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make goodsense for Berkshire’s owners. Duringthepasttwoyears,wethereforerepurchased9%ofthesharesthatwereoutstandingatyearend2019foratotal cost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10% more of all Berkshire businesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola and Moody’s). I want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares must offer appropriate value. Wedon’twanttooverpayforthesharesofothercompanies,anditwouldbevalue-destroyingifweweretooverpay whenwe are buyingBerkshire.AsofFebruary23,2022,sinceyearendwerepurchasedadditionalsharesatacostof $1.2billion.Ourappetiteremainslargebutwillalwaysremainprice-dependent. ItshouldbenotedthatBerkshire’sbuybackopportunitiesarelimitedbecauseofitshigh-classinvestorbase. If our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes would materially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by making repurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keep attitudeslimittheextenttowhichlong-termshareholderscanprofitfromopportunisticrepurchases.

For a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, that course made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative “synergies” – savings that would be achievedastheacquirorslashedduplicatedfunctionsatTTI. But . . .

To say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the company employed2,387.Nowthenumberis8,043.AlargepercentageofthatgrowthtookplaceinFortWorthandenvirons.

Annually,IwouldcallPaulandtellhimhissalaryshouldbesubstantiallyincreased.Annually,hewouldtell me,“Wecantalkaboutthatnextyear,Warren;I’mtoobusynow.” When Greg Abel and I attended Paul’s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-time associates(includingTTI’sfirstemployee)andJohnRoach,theformerCEOofaFortWorthcompanyBerkshirehad purchasedin2000.JohnhadsteeredhisfriendPaultoOmaha,instinctivelyknowingwewouldbeamatch.
