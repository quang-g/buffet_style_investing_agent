A note to readers: Fifty years ago, today’s management took charge at Berkshire. For this Golden Anniversary, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50 years and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what the other had written. Warren’s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie’s on page 39.

With that in mind, we have added a new set of data – the historical record of Berkshire’s stock price – to the performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term. Monthlyoryearlymovementsofstocksareoftenerraticandnotindicativeofchangesinintrinsicvalue.Overtime, however, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company’s shares. * All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares.

During that 12-year stretch, our float – money that doesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – has grown from $41 billion to $84 billion.

Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8 billion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, the largest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed under Marmon’sjurisdiction. Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren’t.) They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularly appealing.Wewillmakemanymoreofthesebolt-ondealsinfutureyears. ‹ Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in the acquisition of Heinz.

We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our ownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, American Express and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership of Wells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder this math:Forthefourcompaniesinaggregate,eachincreaseofone-tenthofapercentinourownershipraises Berkshire’sportionoftheirannualearningsby$50million. These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamondthantoownallofarhinestone.

The earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a move that enhances Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime.

AmongArno’s “certain things,” I wouldinclude twoseparate skills, theevaluation ofinvestments andthe management of businesses. I therefore think it’s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our two investment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses.

Insurance Let’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has propelled ourexpansion since1967,whenweacquired NationalIndemnityanditssistercompany,NationalFire& Marine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution was simplicityitself.

On pages 128-129, we reproduce the 11⁄ 2-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction. That contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire’s best deal: National IndemnitytodayhasGAAP(generallyacceptedaccountingprinciples)networthof$111billion,whichexceedsthat ofanyotherinsurerintheworld. One reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers gettoinvest this float fortheir benefit. Thoughindividual policies andclaims comeandgo,theamountof float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows,sodoesourfloat.Andhowwehavegrown,asthefollowingtableshows: Year Float(in$millions) 1970 $ 39 1980 237 1990 1,632 2000 27,871 2010 65,832 2014 83,921 Further gains in float will be tough to achieve.

If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit thataddstotheinvestmentincomeourfloatproduces.Whensuchaprofitisearned,weenjoytheuseoffreemoney –and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profit problemsoftheindustry. As noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for twelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message is givenatleastlipservicebyallinsurers;atBerkshireitisareligion. So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount ofourfloatisdeductedasaliability,justasifwehadtopayitouttomorrowandcouldnotreplenishit.Buttothink of float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, wepay old claims andrelatedexpenses–ahuge$22.7billiontomorethansixmillionclaimantsin2014–andthatreducesfloat.Just assurely,weeachdaywritenewbusinessandtherebygeneratenewclaimsthataddtofloat. If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, whichIbelieve itwillbe,thetruevalueofthis liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises – becausenewbusinessisalmostcertaintodeliverasubstitute–isworldsdifferentfromowing$1thatwillgooutthe doortomorrowandnotbereplaced.Thetwotypesofliabilitiesaretreatedasequals,however,underGAAP. A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying ourinsurancecompaniesandthatincreasesbookvalue.Inverylargepart,thisgoodwillrepresentsthepricewepaid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwillassetcarriedonthebooksshouldbedeemedvalueless,whateveritsoriginalcost. Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (with whichweagree)thisexcessvaluewillneverbeenteredonourbooks.ButIcanassureyouthatit’sreal.That’sone reason–ahugereason–whywebelieveBerkshire’sintrinsicbusinessvaluesubstantiallyexceedsitsbookvalue. ************ Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplinedoperationsthatpossesshard-to-replicatebusinessmodels.Letmetellyouaboutthemajorunits.

His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business.

For example, if the insuranceindustryshouldexperiencea$250billionlossfromsomemega-catastrophe –alossabouttripleanything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings.

It must (1) understand all exposuresthatmightcauseapolicytoincurlosses;(2)conservativelyassessthelikelihoodofanyexposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premiumcan’tbeobtained.

The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises to paymoneyinthefutureshouldcertainunwantedeventsoccur. Sometimes,thepromisewillnotbetestedfordecades.(Thinkoflifeinsuranceboughtbypeopleintheir 20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails when paymenttimearrives,isall-important. Berkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world’s largest and most sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities. Thatis,theseinsurers wishedto“cede” theseliabilities –mostofthempotentiallossesfromasbestosclaims–toa reinsurer.Theyneededtherightone,though:Ifareinsurerfailstopayaloss,theoriginalinsurerisstillonthehook for it.

This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshireshareholdersthatwillonlygetmorevaluablewithtime. Regulated,Capital-IntensiveBusinesses We have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), that share important characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in thisletterandsplitouttheircombinedfinancialstatisticsinourGAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement. Akeycharacteristicofbothcompaniesistheirhugeinvestmentinverylong-lived,regulatedassets,with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition of coverageispre-taxearnings/interest,notEBITDA/interest,acommonlyusedmeasureweviewasseriouslyflawed.) AtBHE,meanwhile,twofactorsensurethecompany’sabilitytoserviceitsdebtunderallcircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an essential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earnings streams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Recently, we have further broadened that base through our $3 billion (Canadian) acquisition of AltaLink, an electric transmission system serving 85% of Alberta’s population. This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage of beingownedbyastrongparent,hasenabledBHEanditsutilitysubsidiariestosignificantlylowertheircostofdebt. Thiseconomicfactbenefitsbothusandourcustomers. Everyday,ourtwosubsidiariespowertheAmericaneconomyinmajorways: (cid:129) BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline.

In addition,wearealeaderinrenewables:Fromastandingstarttenyearsago,BHEnowaccountsfor6%of thecountry’swindgenerationcapacityand7%ofitssolargenerationcapacity.Beyondthesebusinesses, BHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country’s natural gas consumption; the recently- purchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U.K. and Philippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout the worldfordecadestocome. BHE can make these investments because it retains all of its earnings. In fact, last year the company retained more dollars of earnings – by far – than any other American electric utility. We and our regulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage – one almost certain to distinguish BHEfromotherutilitiesformanyyearstocome.

Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need massive investments in both transportation and energy. It isintheself-interest ofgovernments totreat capital providers in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent. Last year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our rates remainlow,ourcustomersatisfactionishighandourrecordforemployeesafetyisamongthebestintheindustry. The story at BNSF, however – as I noted earlier – was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad disappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF has madeinrecentyears,withthosehavingfarexceededtheoutlaysmadebyUnionPacific,ourprincipalcompetitor. The two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably more freight(measuredeitherbycarloadsorton-miles).ButourserviceproblemsexceededUnionPacific’slastyear,and welostmarket shareasaresult. Moreover, U.P.’searnings beatoursbyarecord amount.Clearly, wehavealotof worktodo. We are wasting notime: AsIalsomentioned earlier, wewillspend$6billion in2015onimproving our railroad’s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as the industry’s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentage compares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U.P.’s projection for the near future of 16-17%. Our huge investments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits should follow.

Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 49. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAP figures. Iwon’texplainalloftheadjustments–somearetinyandarcane–butseriousinvestorsshouldunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no way lose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges against other intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accounting rules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAPaccounting draws nodistinction between the twotypes of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though from an investor’s viewpoint theycouldnotbemoredifferent. In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have been deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non- existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real amortizationchargeswillalmostcertainlyrisefurtherasweacquiremorecompanies. TheGAAP-compliant table onpage67givesyouthecurrent status ofourintangible assets. Wenowhave $7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course, every dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even if trueearningsareflat. Depreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report isarealcost.That’strue,moreover,atmostothercompanies.WhenCEOstoutEBITDAasavaluationguide,wire themupforapolygraphtest.

AtMarmon’srailroad-caroperation,leaserateshaveimprovedsubstantiallyoverthepastfewyears.The nature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually.

One further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, we manufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book any profit when we transfer cars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a “bargain” price. The difference between that figure and a “retail” price is only slowly reflected in our earnings through smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car.

In 2013, I soured somewhat on the company’s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing a profit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive.

(The company, we should mention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444 million, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire’s net worth.

There is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars. Thinkbacktoour2011annualreport,inwhichwedefinedinvestingas“thetransfer toothersofpurchasingpower now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power – after taxes have been paid on nominal gains–inthefuture.” Theunconventional,butinescapable,conclusiontobedrawnfromthepastfiftyyearsisthatithasbeenfar safer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities – Treasuries, for example – whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, a period including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree or anotheritisalmostcertaintoberepeatedduringthenextcentury. Stock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings.

Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is far from synonymouswithrisk.Popularformulasthatequatethetwotermsleadstudents,investorsandCEOsastray. It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and purchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors – say, investment banks – whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sell securities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for funds shouldkeepappropriatesumsinTreasuriesorinsuredbankdeposits. For the great majority of investors, however, who can – and should – invest with a multi-decade horizon, quotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasing power over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less riskythandollar-basedsecurities. If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may, ironically,endupdoingsomeveryriskythings.Recall,ifyouwill,thepunditswhosixyearsagobemoanedfalling stock prices and advised investing in “safe” Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded this sermonarenowearningapittanceonsumstheyhadpreviouslyexpectedwouldfinanceapleasantretirement.(The S&P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, these investors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fund whose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups and downs,tobesure).

To deal with that possible problem, Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the period around meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer.

That gets expensive. Those people on a tight budgetshouldchecktheAirbnbwebsite. ************ For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All- Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of our managers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work.

A line from a country song expressesourfeelingaboutnewventures,turnarounds,orauction-likesales:“Whenthephonedon’tring,you’llknowit’sme.” Berkshire–Past,PresentandFuture IntheBeginning On May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to its shareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I was surprisedbytheprice. Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership Ltd.(“BPL”),aninvestingentitythatImanagedandinwhichIhadvirtuallyallofmynetworth.Shortlybeforethe tenderofferwasmailed,StantonhadaskedmeatwhatpriceBPLwouldsellitsholdings.Ianswered$11.50,andhe said,“Fine,wehaveadeal.” Thencame Berkshire’s letter, offering aneighthofapointless.IbristledatStanton’s behavioranddidn’ttender. Thatwasamonumentallystupiddecision. Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it operatedwasheadingsouth,bothmetaphoricallyandphysically.AndBerkshire,foravarietyofreasons,wasunable tochangecourse. That was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s own Board minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out of business forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply and demandhavebeenbalanced.” Aboutayearafterthatboardmeeting,BerkshireFineSpinningAssociatesandHathawayManufacturing– both with roots in the 19th Century – joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and 10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managements viewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following the consolidation,Berkshireoperatedatanoverallloss,anditsnetworthshrunkby37%. Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase shares.Andthatpatterncaughtmyattention. I purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more repurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 and book value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff remaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasure wasenjoyed,however,nomorecouldbeexpected. Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964move, set outtorepurchaseshareswiththeshutdownproceeds.ThepricethatStantonofferedwas50%abovethecostofour original purchases. There it was – my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for other discardedbutts. Instead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire shares. ByApril1965,BPLowned392,633shares(outof1,017,547thenoutstanding) andatanearly-May board meeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury’s and my childish behavior – after all, what wasaneighthofapointtoeither ofus?–helosthisjob,andIfoundmyselfwithmorethan25%ofBPL’scapital investedinaterriblebusinessaboutwhichIknewverylittle.Ibecamethedogwhocaughtthecar. Because of Berkshire’s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had fallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by the textileoperation:Thecompanyhadnoexcesscashandoweditsbank$2.5million.(Berkshire’s1964annualreport isreproducedonpages130-142.) For a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of goodoperating conditions. Better yet, its earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisen fromthedisastrousresultsinearlieryears. Then the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the textile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness – stupidity? – has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the towel andclosedtheoperation. ************ Undeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL’s resources to a dying business, I quickly compoundedtheerror.Indeed,mysecondblunderwasfarmoreseriousthanthefirst,eventuallybecomingthemost costlyinmycareer. Earlyin1967,IhadBerkshirepay$8.6milliontobuyNationalIndemnityCompany(“NICO”),asmallbut promising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company wasalso included in the deal.) Insurance wasin my sweet spot:Iunderstoodandlikedtheindustry. Jack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me – me, personally. In no way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I’ve had 48 years to think about that question, and I’ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossal mistake. If BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I wouldhave owned100% of a fine business, destined to formthebaseforbuildingthecompanyBerkshirehasbecome.Moreover,ourgrowthwouldnothavebeenimpeded for nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation.

CharlieStraightensMeOut My cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens of free puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absolute investmentperformance. Eventhen,however,Imadeafewexceptionstocigarbutts,themostimportantbeingGEICO.Thankstoa 1951conversationIhadwithLorimerDavidson,awonderfulmanwholaterbecameCEOofthecompany,Ilearned thatGEICOwasaterrificbusinessandpromptlyput65%ofmy$9,800networthintoitsshares.Mostofmygains in those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. Ben Grahamhadtaughtmethattechnique,anditworked. But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only toapoint.Withlargesums,itwouldneverworkwell.

Though he began hiscareer asapracticing lawyer(withhistimebilledat$15perhour),Charliemadehisfirstrealmoneyinhis30s by designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that he livesintoday–some55yearslater.(Likeme,Charliecan’tbebudgedifheishappyinhissurroundings.)Inrecent years,CharliehasdesignedlargedormcomplexesatStanfordandtheUniversityofMichiganandtoday,atage91, isworkingonanothermajorproject. From my perspective, though, Charlie’s most important architectural feat was the design of today’s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices;instead,buywonderfulbusinessesatfairprices. Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without Charlie’s input, so whyshould I listen to a lawyer whohad never spent a day in business school (when –ahem–I had attended three). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his logicwasirrefutable.Consequently,BerkshirehasbeenbuilttoCharlie’sblueprint.Myrolehasbeenthatofgeneral contractor,withtheCEOsofBerkshire’ssubsidiariesdoingtherealworkassub-contractors. The year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part – remembermy1975purchaseofWaumbec).WehadtheopportunitythentobuySee’sCandyforBlueChipStamps, acompanyinwhichCharlie,IandBerkshirehadmajorstakes,andwhichwaslatermergedintoBerkshire. See’s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning about $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a huge asset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significant pricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See’smajor gainsinearnings overtime. Better yet,these would materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See’s could be expected to gushcashfordecadestocome. ThefamilycontrollingSee’swanted$30millionforthebusiness,andCharlierightlysaiditwasworththat much. But I didn’t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn’t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A price that was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrific purchase.But,luckily,thesellersdecidedtotakeour$25millionbid. To date, See’s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only $40million. See’s has thus beenabletodistribute hugesumsthat havehelpedBerkshire buyotherbusinesses that, in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, through watching See’s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes to manyotherprofitableinvestments. ************ Even with Charlie’s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was Dexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like a cigarbutt.Itscompetitivestrengths,however,weresoontoevaporatebecauseofforeigncompetition.AndIsimply didn’tseethatcoming. Consequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP accounting, however, doesn’t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshire stock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7 billion.Asafinancialdisaster,thisonedeservesaspotintheGuinnessBookofWorldRecords. Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose earnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderful business–whichBerkshiremostcertainlyis–forownershipofaso-sobusinessirreparablydestroysvalue. We’ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares Berkshirehasowned(withtheerrorssometimesoccurringwhileIwasservingasadirector).ToooftenCEOsseem blind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater than theintrinsicvalueofthebusinessyoureceive. I’ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-for- stock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker’s focus will be on describing “customary” premiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions –an absolutely asinine wayto evaluate the attractiveness ofanacquisition –orwhetherthedealwillincreasetheacquirer’searnings-per-share (whichinitself should be far from determinative). In striving to achieve the desired per-share number, a panting CEO and his “helpers”willoftenconjureupfanciful“synergies.”(Asadirectorof19companiesovertheyears,I’veneverheard “dis-synergies” mentioned, though I’ve witnessed plenty of these once deals have closed.) Post mortems of acquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms. Theyshouldinsteadbestandardpractice.

BerkshireToday Berkshireisnowasprawlingconglomerate,constantlytryingtosprawlfurther. Conglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly deserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why the conglomerateformbringshugeandenduringadvantagestoBerkshire. SinceIentered thebusiness world,conglomerates haveenjoyedseveral periods ofextreme popularity, the silliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality, promotion or dubious accounting – and often by all three – these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate’s stock to, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-so timesearnings.Theyimmediatelyapplied“pooling”accountingtotheacquisition,which–withnotadime’sworth of change in the underlying businesses – automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof of managerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even the enhancement, of the acquirer’s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure and therebycreateever-increasingper-shareearnings. WallStreet’sloveaffairwiththishocus-pocusintensifiedasthe1960srolledby.TheStreet’sdenizensare always ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings, particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willingly sprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates’ accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how to furtherjuicethenumbers.Formany,gushersofeasymoneywashedawayethicalsensitivities. Sincetheper-share earnings gainsofanexpandingconglomerate camefromexploitingp/edifferences, its CEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristically mediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate’s collection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was deal velocityandpoolingaccountingtheylookedtoforincreasedearnings. Theresulting firestorm of merger activity wasfannedbyanadoring press.Companies suchasITT,Litton Industries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famous conglomeratesarenowlonggone.AsYogiBerrasaid,“EveryNapoleonmeetshisWatergate.”) Back then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts –many of them ridiculously transparent –were excused or overlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a huge plus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reported earnings would never disappoint, no matter how badtheoperatingrealitiesofthebusinessmightbecome. In the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his “bold, imaginative accounting.” Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found a managerwhoseforecastswerecertaintobemet,whateverthebusinessresultsmightbe. Eventually, however,theclockstruck twelve,andeverything turnedtopumpkinsandmice.Onceagain,it became evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares – just like chain-letter models – most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodically blossominourcountry–theyareeverypromoter’sdream–thoughoftentheyappearinacarefully-crafteddisguise.

To put the case simply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capital growth. Oneoftheheraldedvirtuesofcapitalismisthatitefficientlyallocatesfunds.Theargumentisthatmarkets will direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all its excesses,market-drivenallocationofcapitalisusuallyfarsuperiortoanyalternative. Nevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire minutes made clear, capital withdrawals within thetextile industry thatshouldhavebeenobviousweredelayedfor decades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning our obsoletetextilemillsforfartoolong. ACEOwithcapitalemployedinadecliningoperationseldomelectstomassivelyredeploythatcapitalinto unrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes be admitted. Moreover, it’s unlikely that CEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment job evenifheorshewasinclinedtoundertakeit. Attheshareholderlevel,taxesandfrictionalcostsweighheavilyonindividualinvestorswhentheyattempt to reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as they move capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes then clamor to be fed –among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers andsuchcapital-reallocators asleveragedbuyoutoperators.Money-shufflersdon’tcomecheap. In contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and at minimalcost.Ofcourse,formitselfisnoguaranteeofsuccess:Wehavemadeplentyofmistakes,andwewillmake more.Ourstructuraladvantages,however,areformidable.

That’s important: If horses had controlledinvestmentdecisions,therewouldhavebeennoautoindustry. Another major advantage wepossess is the ability to buypieces of wonderful businesses –a.k.a.common stocks. That’s not a course of action open to most managements.

Additionally, the gains we’ve realized from marketable securities have helpedusmakecertainlargeacquisitionsthatwouldotherwisehavebeenbeyondourfinancialcapabilities. In effect, the world is Berkshire’s oyster – a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those realistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we can evaluate.Andthat’saseriouslimitation:CharlieandIhavenoideawhatagreatmanycompanieswilllookliketen years from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has been confined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a far larger size than the many businesses thatareconstrainedbythelimitedpotentialofthesingleindustryinwhichtheyoperate. I mentioned earlier that See’s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital requirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. But our many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we have used the excess funds generated by See’s to help purchase other businesses. If See’s had remained a stand-alone company, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavily depletedbylargetaxesand,almostalways,bysignificantfrictionalandagencycosts. ************ Berkshirehasonefurtheradvantagethathasbecomeincreasinglyimportantovertheyears:Wearenowthe homeofchoicefortheownersandmanagersofmanyoutstandingbusinesses.

Berkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which the company’speopleandculturewillberetained(though,occasionally,managementchangeswillbeneeded).Beyond that, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealing withbanksandWallStreetanalystsarealsoforeverended. Some sellers don’t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of competition. ************ Sometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no sense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability to move funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicate themselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here’s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominal costs for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directors wouldsoar.So,too,wouldregulatoryandadministrationexpenditures.

The bankers explain that the spun-off company will flourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracy oftheparentcompany.(SomuchforthattalentedCEOwemetearlier.) If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be urged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege. (Mental “flexibility” of this sort by the bankingfraternityhaspromptedthesayingthatfeestoooftenleadtotransactionsratherthantransactionsleadingto fees.) It’s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators. Berkshirecarriedoutsuchaspin-offin1979,whennewregulationsforbankholdingcompaniesforcedustodivest abankweownedinRockford,Illinois. Voluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation flexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages.

But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had no peerinthatrespect. Ling’s strategy, which he labeled “project redeployment,” was to buy a large company and then partially spin off its various divisions.

Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge what was coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what I wouldsaytomyfamilytodayiftheyaskedmeaboutBerkshire’sfuture. ‹ First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshire shareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That’s because our per-share intrinsicbusinessvalueisalmostcertaintoadvanceovertime. This cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor’s entry point into Berkshirestockisunusuallyhigh–ataprice,say,approachingdoublebookvalue,whichBerkshireshares have occasionally reached – it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In other words,asoundinvestment canmorphintoarashspeculation ifitisboughtatanelevatedprice.Berkshire isnotexemptfromthistruth. Purchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company wouldrepurchaseitsshares,however,shouldproducegainswithinareasonableperiodoftime.Berkshire’s directors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our view,thatisanessentialcriterionforrepurchasesthatisoftenignoredbyothermanagements.) For those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer no assurances, whatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods will likelybefarmoreimportant indetermining yourresultsthantheconcomitantchangeintheintrinsicvalue ofyourBerkshireshares.AsBenGrahamsaidmanydecadesago:“Intheshort-termthemarketisavoting machine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.” Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors – amateursandprofessionalsalike–borderonlunacy. Since I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire sharesonlyifyouexpecttoholdthemforatleastfiveyears.Thosewhoseekshort-termprofitsshouldlook elsewhere. Another warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three times since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close to this kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be a satisfactory holding for investors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing leverage. ‹ I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero. We will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs wewill be selling life jackets to the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a “first responder” during the 2008-2009 meltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earnings potential.YourcompanyistheGibraltarofAmericanbusinessandwillremainso. Financialstayingpowerrequiresacompanytomaintainthreestrengthsunderallcircumstances:(1)alarge and reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) no significant near-term cash requirements.

Indeed, in a three-week period spanninglate September andearlyOctober,wesupplied$15.6billionoffreshmoneytoAmericanbusinesses.

And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed to deliverliquidityandactuallydoso,exceptwhenitistrulyneeded.Whenbillscomedue,onlycashislegal tender.Don’tleavehomewithoutit. Finally – getting to our third point – we will never engage in operating or investment practices that can result in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debt maturitiesofsizenorenterintoderivativecontractsorotherbusinessarrangementsthatcouldrequirelarge collateralcalls. Some years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly mispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable. Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that ended our interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for some years,writtenthesecontracts,exceptforafewneededforoperationalpurposesatourutilitybusinesses. Moreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option. Many life insurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a “run” in times of extremepanic.Contractsofthatsort,however,donotexistintheproperty-casualtyworldthatweinhabit.If ourpremiumvolumeshouldshrink,ourfloatwoulddecline–butonlyataveryslowpace. The reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely predictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Though practically alldaysarerelatively uneventful,tomorrowisalwaysuncertain.(Ifeltnospecialapprehension on December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can’t predict what tomorrow will bring, you mustbepreparedforwhateveritdoes. ACEOwhois64andplanstoretireat65mayhavehisownspecialcalculusinevaluatingrisksthathave only a tiny chance of happening in a given year. Hemay, in fact, be “right” 99% of thetime.

In our view, it is madnesstorisklosingwhatyouneedinpursuingwhatyousimplydesire. ‹ Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning powerofBerkshire.

Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection and retentionofoutstandingmanagerstocaptainouroperatingsubsidiaries.Obviously,thejobalsorequiresthe replacement of a subsidiary’s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire’s CEO to be a rational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights into humanbehavior.It’simportantaswellthatheknowshislimits.(AsTomWatson,Sr.ofIBMsaid,“I’mno genius,butI’msmartinspotsandIstayaroundthosespots.”) Character is crucial: A Berkshire CEOmust be “all in” for the company, not for himself. (I’m using male pronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can’t help but earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it’s important that neither ego nor avarice motivate himtoreachforpaymatchinghismostlavishly-compensated peers,evenifhisachievements far exceed theirs. A CEO’s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it’s clear to them that shareholders’ interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way of thinking. My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintain friendshipsIwillexhumeonlycasesfromthedistantpast.

They will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to be coordinated with Berkshire’s operating and acquisition programs.

WarrenE.Buffett ViceChairman’sThoughts–PastandFuture TotheshareholdersofBerkshireHathawayInc.: I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire’s uncommon success under Warren Buffett.

Both the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I knowofhashalfofsuchelementsinplace.

Well,Buffett,evenwhenonly34yearsold,controlledabout45%ofBerkshire’ssharesandwascompletelytrusted byalltheotherbigshareholders.Hecouldinstallwhateversystemhewanted.Andhedidso,creatingtheBerkshire system. Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire’s achievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations.

WhenBuffettdevelopedtheBerkshiresystem,didheforeseeallthebenefitsthatfollowed?No.Buffettstumbledinto somebenefitsthroughpracticeevolution.But,whenhesawusefulconsequences,hestrengthenedtheircauses. WhydidBerkshireunderBuffettdosowell? Onlyfourlargefactorsoccurtome: (1) TheconstructivepeculiaritiesofBuffett, (2) TheconstructivepeculiaritiesoftheBerkshiresystem, (3) Goodluck,and (4) The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the press. I believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive peculiarities,theweirddevotion,andtheirinteractions. In particular, Buffett’s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to keep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became good attennis. Buffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won most regularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponents alwaysfacedhisbestplayers,insteadofhissecondbest.And,withtheextraplayingtime,thebestplayersimproved morethanwasnormal. AndBuffettmuchout-WoodenedWooden,becauseinhiscasetheexerciseofskillwasconcentratedinoneperson, not seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deteriorating liketheskillofabasketballplayerdoes. Moreover,byconcentratingsomuchpowerandauthorityintheoften-long-servingCEOsofimportantsubsidiaries, Buffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs and theachievementsofthesubsidiaries. Then, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and Berkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries into Berkshire,andbetterCEOsaswell. AndthebettersubsidiariesandCEOsthenrequiredlessattentionfromheadquarters,creatingwhatisoftencalleda “virtuouscircle.” HowwelldiditworkoutforBerkshiretoalwaysincludecasualtyinsurersasimportantsubsidiaries? Marvelouslywell.Berkshire’sambitionswereunreasonablyextremeand,evenso,itgotwhatitwanted. Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders’ equity, as didBerkshire’sinsurancesubsidiaries.AndtheS&P500Indexproducedabout10%perannum,pre-tax,duringthe last50years,creatingasignificanttailwind. And, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries greatly outperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire’s stockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance (perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurance business that produced both a huge “float” and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire, followed by a quadrupling of GEICO’s market share. And the rest of Berkshire’s insurance operations hugely improved,largelybydintofreputationaladvantage,underwritingdiscipline,findingandstayingwithingoodniches, andrecruitingandholdingoutstandingpeople. Then, later, as Berkshire’s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became well known, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buy privatelyissuedsecurities.Mostofthesesecuritieshadfixedmaturitiesandproducedoutstandingresults. Berkshire’s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is a producer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire’s better outcome wasso astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett wouldnowfail to recreate itifhereturned toasmall basewhileretaininghissmartsandregaininghisyouth. DidBerkshiresufferfrombeingadiffuseconglomerate?No,itsopportunitieswereusefullyenlargedbyawidened areaforoperation.Andbadeffects,commonelsewhere,werepreventedbyBuffett’sskills. WhydidBerkshireprefertobuycompanieswithcash,insteadofitsownstock?Well,itwashardtogetanythingin exchangeforBerkshirestockthatwasasvaluableaswhatwasgivenup. Why did Berkshire’s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshire shareholderswhenthenormalresultinsuchacquisitionsisbadforshareholdersoftheacquirer? Well, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the equivalent of a “department of acquisitions” under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from “helpers” sure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertise while he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn’t in business, aided by his long experienceasapassiveinvestor.And,finally,evenwhenBerkshirewasgettingmuchbetteropportunitiesthanmost others, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten years incontrolofBerkshire,Buffettsawonebusiness(textiles)moveclosetodeathandtwonewbusinessescomein,for anetgainofone. What werethebigmistakes madebyBerkshire underBuffett? Well, whilemistakes ofcommission werecommon, almostallhugeerrorswereinnotmakingapurchase,includingnotpurchasingWalmartstockwhenthatwassureto workoutenormouslywell.Theerrorsofomissionwereofmuchimportance.Berkshire’snetworthwouldnowbeat least $50billion higherifithadseizedseveralopportunities itwasnotquitesmartenoughtorecognizeasvirtually surethings. Thenexttolasttaskonmylistwas:PredictwhetherabnormallygoodresultswouldcontinueatBerkshireifBuffett weresoontodepart. The answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable competitiveadvantage. Moreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new fixedassets.Andmanysubsidiariesarenowengagedinmakingwise“bolt-on”acquisitions. ProvidedthatmostoftheBerkshiresystemremainsinplace,thecombinedmomentumandopportunitynowpresent is so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if (1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never again purchasedalargebusiness. But, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be “of only moderate ability.” For instance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers whowouldprobably be under-described as “world-class.” “World-leading” would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better business executivethanBuffett. And I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire muchchangeintheBerkshiresystem. NordoI think that desirable purchases of newbusinesses wouldend with Buffett’s departure. With Berkshire now so large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and that Berkshire’s$60billionincashwillconstructivelydecrease. My final task was to consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may proveusefulelsewhere. Theanswerisplainlyyes.InitsearlyBuffettyears,Berkshirehadabigtaskahead:turningatinystashintoalarge andusefulcompany.Anditsolvedthatproblembyavoidingbureaucracyandrelyingmuchononethoughtfulleader foralong,longtimeashekeptimprovingandbroughtinmorepeoplelikehimself. Compare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession of CEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixed retirementage. IbelievethatversionsoftheBerkshiresystemshouldbetriedmoreoftenelsewhereandthattheworstattributesof bureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble.
