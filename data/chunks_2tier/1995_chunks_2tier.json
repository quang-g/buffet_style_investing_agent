    "content": "Acquisitions\n\nIt may seem strange that we exult over a year in which we\nmade three acquisitions, given that we have regularly used these\npages to question the acquisition activities of most managers.\nRest assured, Charlie and I haven't lost our skepticism: We\nbelieve most deals do damage to the shareholders of the acquiring\ncompany. Too often, the words from\nHMS Pinafore\napply: \"Things\nare seldom what they seem, skim milk masquerades as cream.\"\nSpecifically, sellers and their representatives invariably\npresent financial projections having more entertainment value\nthan educational value. In the production of rosy scenarios,\nWall Street can hold its own against Washington.\n\nIn any case, why potential buyers even look at projections\nprepared by sellers baffles me. Charlie and I never give them a\nglance, but instead keep in mind the story of the man with an\nailing horse. Visiting the vet, he said: \"Can you help me?\nSometimes my horse walks just fine and sometimes he limps.\" The\nvet's reply was pointed: \"No problem - when he's walking fine,\nsell him.\" In the world of mergers and acquisitions, that horse\nwould be peddled as Secretariat.\n\nAt Berkshire, we have all the difficulties in perceiving the\nfuture that other acquisition-minded companies do. Like they\nalso, we face the inherent problem that the seller of a business\npractically always knows far more about it than the buyer and\nalso picks the time of sale - a time when the business is likely\nto be walking \"just fine.\"\n\nEven so, we do have a few advantages, perhaps the greatest\nbeing that we\ndon't\nhave a strategic plan. Thus we feel no need\nto proceed in an ordained direction (a course leading almost\ninvariably to silly purchase prices) but can instead simply\ndecide what makes sense for our owners. In doing that, we always\nmentally compare any move we are contemplating with dozens of\nother opportunities open to us, including the purchase of small\npieces of the best businesses in the world via the stock market.\nOur practice of making this comparison - acquisitions against\npassive investments - is a discipline that managers focused\nsimply on expansion seldom use.\n\nTalking to\nTime Magazine\na few years back, Peter Drucker got\nto the heart of things: \"I will tell you a secret: Dealmaking\nbeats working. Dealmaking is exciting and fun, and working is\ngrubby. Running anything is primarily an enormous amount of\ngrubby detail work . . . dealmaking is romantic, sexy. That's\nwhy you have deals that make no sense.\"\n\nIn making acquisitions, we have a further advantage: As\npayment, we can offer sellers a stock backed by an extraordinary\ncollection of outstanding businesses. An individual or a family\nwishing to dispose of a single fine business, but also wishing to\ndefer personal taxes indefinitely, is apt to find Berkshire stock\na particularly comfortable holding. I believe, in fact, that\nthis calculus played an important part in the two acquisitions\nfor which we paid shares in 1995.\n\nBeyond that, sellers sometimes care about placing their\ncompanies in a corporate home that will both endure and provide\npleasant, productive working conditions for their managers. Here\nagain, Berkshire offers something special. Our managers operate\nwith extraordinary autonomy. Additionally, our ownership\nstructure enables sellers to know that when I say we are buying\nto keep, the promise means something. For our part, we like\ndealing with owners who care what happens to their companies and\npeople. A buyer is likely to find fewer unpleasant surprises\ndealing with that type of seller than with one simply auctioning\noff his business.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing being an explanation of our\nacquisition style, it is, of course, a not-so-subtle sales pitch.\nIf you own or represent a business earning $25 million or more\nbefore tax, and it fits the criteria listed on page 23, just\ngive me a call. Our discussion will be confidential. And if you\naren't interested now, file our proposition in the back of your\nmind: We are never going to lose our appetite for buying\ncompanies with good economics and excellent management.\n\nConcluding this little dissertation on acquisitions, I can't\nresist repeating a tale told me last year by a corporate\nexecutive. The business he grew up in was a fine one, with a\nlong-time record of leadership in its industry. Its main\nproduct, however, was distressingly glamorless. So several\ndecades ago, the company hired a management consultant who -\nnaturally - advised diversification, the then-current fad.\n(\"Focus\" was not yet in style.) Before long, the company\nacquired a number of businesses, each after the consulting firm\nhad gone through a long - and expensive - acquisition study. And\nthe outcome? Said the executive sadly, \"When we started, we were\ngetting 100% of our earnings from the original business. After\nten years, we were getting 150%.\"",

    "content": "Talking to\nTime Magazine\na few years back, Peter Drucker got\nto the heart of things: \"I will tell you a secret: Dealmaking\nbeats working. Dealmaking is exciting and fun, and working is\ngrubby. Running anything is primarily an enormous amount of\ngrubby detail work . . . dealmaking is romantic, sexy. That's\nwhy you have deals that make no sense.\"\n\nIn making acquisitions, we have a further advantage: As\npayment, we can offer sellers a stock backed by an extraordinary\ncollection of outstanding businesses. An individual or a family\nwishing to dispose of a single fine business, but also wishing to\ndefer personal taxes indefinitely, is apt to find Berkshire stock\na particularly comfortable holding. I believe, in fact, that\nthis calculus played an important part in the two acquisitions\nfor which we paid shares in 1995.\n\nBeyond that, sellers sometimes care about placing their\ncompanies in a corporate home that will both endure and provide\npleasant, productive working conditions for their managers. Here\nagain, Berkshire offers something special. Our managers operate\nwith extraordinary autonomy. Additionally, our ownership\nstructure enables sellers to know that when I say we are buying\nto keep, the promise means something. For our part, we like\ndealing with owners who care what happens to their companies and\npeople. A buyer is likely to find fewer unpleasant surprises\ndealing with that type of seller than with one simply auctioning\noff his business.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing being an explanation of our\nacquisition style, it is, of course, a not-so-subtle sales pitch.\nIf you own or represent a business earning $25 million or more\nbefore tax, and it fits the criteria listed on page 23, just\ngive me a call. Our discussion will be confidential. And if you\naren't interested now, file our proposition in the back of your\nmind: We are never going to lose our appetite for buying\ncompanies with good economics and excellent management.\n\nConcluding this little dissertation on acquisitions, I can't\nresist repeating a tale told me last year by a corporate\nexecutive. The business he grew up in was a fine one, with a\nlong-time record of leadership in its industry. Its main\nproduct, however, was distressingly glamorless. So several\ndecades ago, the company hired a management consultant who -\nnaturally - advised diversification, the then-current fad.\n(\"Focus\" was not yet in style.) Before long, the company\nacquired a number of businesses, each after the consulting firm\nhad gone through a long - and expensive - acquisition study. And\nthe outcome? Said the executive sadly, \"When we started, we were\ngetting 100% of our earnings from the original business. After\nten years, we were getting 150%.\"",

I listened as she told me she'd been\nto, and had enjoyed, the Annual Meeting. A few seconds later, a\nman who'd heard the woman stop me did so as well. He turned out\nto be Barnett Helzberg, Jr., who owned four shares of Berkshire\nand had also been at our meeting.\n\nIn our few minutes of conversation, Barnett said he had a\nbusiness we might be interested in. When people say that, it\nusually turns out they have a lemonade stand - with potential, of\ncourse, to quickly grow into the next Microsoft. So I simply\nasked Barnett to send me particulars. That, I thought to myself.\nwill be the end of that.\n\nNot long after, Barnett sent me the financial statements of\nHelzberg's Diamond Shops. The company had been started by his\ngrandfather in 1915 from a single store in Kansas City and had\ndeveloped by the time we met into a group with 134 stores in 23\nstates. Sales had grown from $10 million in 1974 to $53 million\nin 1984 and $282 million in 1994. We weren't talking lemonade\nstands.\n\nBarnett, then 60, loved the business but also wanted to feel\nfree of it. In 1988, as a step in that direction, he had brought\nin Jeff Comment, formerly President of Wanamaker's, to help him\nrun things. The hiring of Jeff turned out to be a homerun, but\nBarnett still found that he couldn't shake a feeling of ultimate\nresponsibility. Additionally, he owned a valuable asset that was\nsubject to the vagaries of a single, very competitive industry,\nand he thought it prudent to diversify his family's holdings.\n\nBerkshire was made to order for him. It took us awhile to\nget together on price, but there was never any question in my\nmind that, first, Helzberg's was the kind of business that we\nwanted to own and, second, Jeff was our kind of manager. In\nfact, we would not have bought the business if Jeff had not been\nthere to run it. Buying a retailer without good management is\nlike buying the Eiffel Tower without an elevator.\n\nWe completed the Helzberg purchase in 1995 by means of a\ntax-free exchange of stock, the only kind of transaction that\ninterested Barnett. Though he was certainly under no obligation\nto do so, Barnett shared a meaningful part of his proceeds from\nthe sale with a large number of his associates. When someone\nbehaves that generously, you know you are going to be treated\nright as a buyer.\n\nThe average Helzberg's store has annual sales of about $2\nmillion, far more than competitors operating similarly-sized\nstores achieve. This superior per-store productivity is the key\nto Helzberg's excellent profits. If the company continues its\nfirst-rate performance - and we believe it will - it could grow\nrather quickly to several times its present size.\n\nHelzberg's, it should be added, is an entirely different\nsort of operation from Borsheim's, our Omaha jewelry business,\nand the two companies will operate independently of each other.\nBorsheim's had an excellent year in 1995, with sales up 11.7%.\nSusan Jacques, its 36-year-old CEO, had an even better year,\ngiving birth to her second son at the start of the Christmas\nseason.

    "content": "R. C. Willey Home Furnishings\n\nIt was Nebraska Furniture Mart's Irv Blumkin who did the\nwalking around in the case of R. C. Willey, long the leading home\nfurnishings business in Utah. Over the years, Irv had told me\nabout the strengths of that company. And he had also told Bill\nChild, CEO of R. C. Willey, how pleased the Blumkin family had\nbeen with its Berkshire relationship. So in early 1995, Bill\nmentioned to Irv that for estate tax and diversification reasons,\nhe and the other owners of R. C. Willey might be interested in\nselling.\n\nFrom that point forward, things could not have been simpler.\nBill sent me some figures, and I wrote him a letter indicating\nmy idea of value. We quickly agreed on a number, and found our\npersonal chemistry to be perfect. By mid-year, the merger was\ncompleted.\n\nR. C. Willey is an amazing story. Bill took over the\nbusiness from his father-in-law in 1954 when sales were about\n$250,000. From this tiny base, Bill employed Mae West's\nphilosophy: \"It's not what you've got - it's what you do with\nwhat you've got.\" Aided by his brother, Sheldon, Bill has built\nthe company to its 1995 sales volume of $257 million, and it now\naccounts for over 50% of the furniture business in Utah. Like\nNebraska Furniture Mart, R. C. Willey sells appliances,\nelectronics, computers and carpets in addition to furniture.\nBoth companies have about the same sales volume, but NFM gets all\nof its business from one complex in Omaha, whereas R. C. Willey\nwill open its sixth major store in the next few months.\n\nRetailing is a tough business. During my investment career,\nI have watched a large number of retailers enjoy terrific growth\nand superb returns on equity for a period, and then suddenly\nnosedive, often all the way into bankruptcy. This shooting-star\nphenomenon is far more common in retailing than it is in\nmanufacturing or service businesses. In part, this is because a\nretailer must stay smart, day after day. Your competitor is\nalways copying and then topping whatever you do. Shoppers are\nmeanwhile beckoned in every conceivable way to try a stream of\nnew merchants. In retailing, to coast is to fail.\n\nIn contrast to this have-to-be-smart-every-day business,\nthere is what I call the have-to-be-smartonce\nbusiness. For\nexample, if you were smart enough to buy a network TV station\nvery early in the game, you could put in a shiftless and backward\nnephew to run things, and the business would still do well for\ndecades. You'd do far better, of course, if you put in Tom\nMurphy, but you could stay comfortably in the black without him.\nFor a retailer, hiring that nephew would be an express ticket to\nbankruptcy.\n\nThe two retailing businesses we purchased this year are\nblessed with terrific managers who love to compete and have done\nso successfully for decades. Like the CEOs of our other\noperating units, they will operate autonomously: We want them to\nfeel that the businesses they run are\ntheirs.\nThis means no\nsecond-guessing by Charlie and me. We avoid the attitude of the\nalumnus whose message to the football coach is \"I'm 100% with you\n- win or tie.\" Our basic goal as an owner is to behave with our\nmanagers as we like our owners to behave with us.\n\nAs we add more operations, I'm sometimes asked how many\npeople I can handle reporting to me. My answer to that is\nsimple: If I have one person reporting to me and he is a lemon,\nthat's one too many, and if I have managers like those we now\nhave, the number can be almost unlimited. We are lucky to have\nBill and Sheldon associated with us, and we hope that we can\nacquire other businesses that bring with them managers of similar\ncaliber.",

    "content": "R. C. Willey Home Furnishings\n\nIt was Nebraska Furniture Mart's Irv Blumkin who did the\nwalking around in the case of R. C. Willey, long the leading home\nfurnishings business in Utah. Over the years, Irv had told me\nabout the strengths of that company. And he had also told Bill\nChild, CEO of R. C. Willey, how pleased the Blumkin family had\nbeen with its Berkshire relationship. So in early 1995, Bill\nmentioned to Irv that for estate tax and diversification reasons,\nhe and the other owners of R. C. Willey might be interested in\nselling.\n\nFrom that point forward, things could not have been simpler.\nBill sent me some figures, and I wrote him a letter indicating\nmy idea of value. We quickly agreed on a number, and found our\npersonal chemistry to be perfect. By mid-year, the merger was\ncompleted.\n\nR. C. Willey is an amazing story. Bill took over the\nbusiness from his father-in-law in 1954 when sales were about\n$250,000. From this tiny base, Bill employed Mae West's\nphilosophy: \"It's not what you've got - it's what you do with\nwhat you've got.\" Aided by his brother, Sheldon, Bill has built\nthe company to its 1995 sales volume of $257 million, and it now\naccounts for over 50% of the furniture business in Utah. Like\nNebraska Furniture Mart, R. C. Willey sells appliances,\nelectronics, computers and carpets in addition to furniture.\nBoth companies have about the same sales volume, but NFM gets all\nof its business from one complex in Omaha, whereas R. C. Willey\nwill open its sixth major store in the next few months.\n\nRetailing is a tough business. During my investment career,\nI have watched a large number of retailers enjoy terrific growth\nand superb returns on equity for a period, and then suddenly\nnosedive, often all the way into bankruptcy. This shooting-star\nphenomenon is far more common in retailing than it is in\nmanufacturing or service businesses. In part, this is because a\nretailer must stay smart, day after day. Your competitor is\nalways copying and then topping whatever you do. Shoppers are\nmeanwhile beckoned in every conceivable way to try a stream of\nnew merchants. In retailing, to coast is to fail.",

We avoid the attitude of the\nalumnus whose message to the football coach is \"I'm 100% with you\n- win or tie.\" Our basic goal as an owner is to behave with our\nmanagers as we like our owners to behave with us.\n\nAs we add more operations, I'm sometimes asked how many\npeople I can handle reporting to me.

    "content": "GEICO Corporation\n\nRight after yearend, we completed the purchase of 100% of\nGEICO, the seventh largest auto insurer in the United States,\nwith about 3.7 million cars insured. I've had a 45-year\nassociation with GEICO, and though the story has been told\nbefore, it's worth a short recap here.\n\nI attended Columbia University's business school in 1950-51,\nnot because I cared about the degree it offered, but because I\nwanted to study under Ben Graham, then teaching there. The time\nI spent in Ben's classes was a personal high, and quickly induced\nme to learn all I could about my hero. I turned first to\nWho's\nWho in America,\nfinding there, among other things, that Ben was\nChairman of Government Employees Insurance Company, to me an\nunknown company in an unfamiliar industry.\n\nA librarian next referred me to Best's Fire and Casualty\ninsurance manual, where I learned that GEICO was based in\nWashington, DC. So on a Saturday in January, 1951, I took the\ntrain to Washington and headed for GEICO's downtown headquarters.\nTo my dismay, the building was closed, but I pounded on the door\nuntil a custodian appeared. I asked this puzzled fellow if there\nwas anyone in the office I could talk to, and he said he'd seen\none man working on the sixth floor.\n\nAnd thus I met Lorimer Davidson, Assistant to the President,\nwho was later to become CEO. Though my only credentials were\nthat I was a student of Graham's, \"Davy\" graciously spent four\nhours or so showering me with both kindness and instruction. No\none has ever received a better half-day course in how the\ninsurance industry functions nor in the factors that enable one\ncompany to excel over others. As Davy made clear, GEICO's method\nof selling - direct marketing - gave it an enormous cost\nadvantage over competitors that sold through agents, a form of\ndistribution so ingrained in the business of these insurers that\nit was impossible for them to give it up. After my session with\nDavy, I was more excited about GEICO than I have ever been about\na stock.\n\nWhen I finished at Columbia some months later and returned\nto Omaha to sell securities, I naturally focused almost\nexclusively on GEICO. My first sales call - on my Aunt Alice,\nwho always supported me 100% - was successful. But I was then a\nskinny, unpolished 20-year-old who looked about 17, and my pitch\nusually failed. Undaunted, I wrote a short report late in 1951\nabout GEICO for \"The Security I Like Best\" column in The\n\nCommercial and Financial Chronicle,\na leading financial\npublication of the time. More important, I bought stock for my\nown account.\n\nYou may think this odd, but I have kept copies of every tax\nreturn I filed, starting with the return for 1944. Checking\nback, I find that I purchased GEICO shares on four occasions\nduring 1951, the last purchase being made on September 26. This\npattern of persistence suggests to me that my tendency toward\nself-intoxication was developed early. I probably came back on\nthat September day from unsuccessfully trying to sell some\nprospect and decided - despite my already having more than 50% of\nmy net worth in GEICO - to load up further. In any event, I\naccumulated 350 shares of GEICO during the year, at a cost of\n$10,282. At yearend, this holding was worth $13,125, more than\n65% of my net worth.\n\nYou can see why GEICO was my first business love. Furthermore,\njust to complete this stroll down memory lane, I should add\nthat I earned most of the funds I used to buy GEICO shares by\ndelivering\nThe Washington Post,\nthe chief product of a\ncompany that much later made it possible for Berkshire to turn\n$10 million into $500 million.\n\nAlas, I sold my entire GEICO position in 1952 for $15,259,\nprimarily to switch into Western Insurance Securities. This act\nof infidelity can partially be excused by the fact that Western\nwas selling for slightly more than one times its current earnings,\na p/e ratio that for some reason caught my eye. But in the next\n20 years, the GEICO stock I sold grew in value to about $1.3\nmillion, which taught me a lesson about the inadvisability of\nselling a stake in an identifiably-wonderful company.\n\nIn the early 1970's, after Davy retired, the executives\nrunning GEICO made some serious errors in estimating their claims\ncosts, a mistake that led the company to underprice its policies\n- and that almost caused it to go bankrupt. The company was\nsaved only because Jack Byrne came in as CEO in 1976 and took\ndrastic remedial measures.\n\nBecause I believed both in Jack and in GEICO's fundamental\ncompetitive strength, Berkshire purchased a large interest in the\ncompany during the second half of 1976, and also made smaller\npurchases later. By yearend 1980, we had put $45.7 million into\nGEICO and owned 33.3% of its shares. During the next 15 years,\nwe did not make further purchases. Our interest in the company,\nnonetheless, grew to about 50% because it was a big repurchaser\nof its own shares.\n\nThen, in 1995, we agreed to pay $2.3 billion for the half of\nthe company we didn't own. That is a steep price. But it gives\nus full ownership of a growing enterprise whose business remains\nexceptional for precisely the same reasons that prevailed in\n1951. In addition, GEICO has two extraordinary managers: Tony\nNicely, who runs the insurance side of the operation, and Lou\nSimpson, who runs investments.\n\nTony, 52, has been with GEICO for 34 years. There's no one\nI would rather have managing GEICO's insurance operation. He has\nbrains, energy, integrity and focus. If we're lucky, he'll stay\nanother 34 years.\n\nLou runs investments just as ably. Between 1980 and 1995,\nthe equities under Lou's management returned an average of 22.8%\nannually vs. 15.7% for the S&P. Lou takes the same conservative,\nconcentrated approach to investments that we do at Berkshire, and\nit is an enormous plus for us to have him on board. One point\nthat goes beyond Lou's GEICO work: His presence on the scene\nassures us that Berkshire would have an extraordinary\nprofessional immediately available to handle its investments if\nsomething were to happen to Charlie and me.\n\nGEICO, of course, must continue both to attract good\npolicyholders and keep them happy. It must also reserve and\nprice properly. But the ultimate key to the company's success is\nits rock-bottom operating costs, which virtually no competitor\ncan match. In 1995, moreover, Tony and his management team\npushed underwriting and loss adjustment expenses down further to\n23.6% of premiums, nearly one percentage point below 1994's\nratio. In business, I look for economic castles protected by\nunbreachable \"moats.\" Thanks to Tony and his management team,\nGEICO's moat widened in 1995.\n\nFinally, let me bring you up to date on Davy. He's now 93\nand remains my friend and teacher. He continues to pay close\nattention to GEICO and has always been there when the company's\nCEOs - Jack Byrne, Bill Snyder and Tony - have needed him. Our\nacquisition of 100% of GEICO caused Davy to incur a large tax.\nCharacteristically, he still warmly supported the transaction.\n\nDavy has been one of my heroes for the 45 years I've known\nhim, and he's never let me down. You should understand that\nBerkshire would not be where it is today if Davy had not been so\ngenerous with his time on a cold Saturday in 1951. I've often\nthanked him privately, but it is fitting that I use this report\nto thank him on behalf of Berkshire's shareholders.",

More important, I bought stock for my\nown account.\n\nYou may think this odd, but I have kept copies of every tax\nreturn I filed, starting with the return for 1944. Checking\nback, I find that I purchased GEICO shares on four occasions\nduring 1951, the last purchase being made on September 26. This\npattern of persistence suggests to me that my tendency toward\nself-intoxication was developed early. I probably came back on\nthat September day from unsuccessfully trying to sell some\nprospect and decided - despite my already having more than 50% of\nmy net worth in GEICO - to load up further. In any event, I\naccumulated 350 shares of GEICO during the year, at a cost of\n$10,282. At yearend, this holding was worth $13,125, more than\n65% of my net worth.\n\nYou can see why GEICO was my first business love. Furthermore,\njust to complete this stroll down memory lane, I should add\nthat I earned most of the funds I used to buy GEICO shares by\ndelivering\nThe Washington Post,\nthe chief product of a\ncompany that much later made it possible for Berkshire to turn\n$10 million into $500 million.\n\nAlas, I sold my entire GEICO position in 1952 for $15,259,\nprimarily to switch into Western Insurance Securities. This act\nof infidelity can partially be excused by the fact that Western\nwas selling for slightly more than one times its current earnings,\na p/e ratio that for some reason caught my eye. But in the next\n20 years, the GEICO stock I sold grew in value to about $1.3\nmillion, which taught me a lesson about the inadvisability of\nselling a stake in an identifiably-wonderful company.",

    "content": "In the early 1970's, after Davy retired, the executives\nrunning GEICO made some serious errors in estimating their claims\ncosts, a mistake that led the company to underprice its policies\n- and that almost caused it to go bankrupt. The company was\nsaved only because Jack Byrne came in as CEO in 1976 and took\ndrastic remedial measures.\n\nBecause I believed both in Jack and in GEICO's fundamental\ncompetitive strength, Berkshire purchased a large interest in the\ncompany during the second half of 1976, and also made smaller\npurchases later. By yearend 1980, we had put $45.7 million into\nGEICO and owned 33.3% of its shares. During the next 15 years,\nwe did not make further purchases. Our interest in the company,\nnonetheless, grew to about 50% because it was a big repurchaser\nof its own shares.\n\nThen, in 1995, we agreed to pay $2.3 billion for the half of\nthe company we didn't own. That is a steep price. But it gives\nus full ownership of a growing enterprise whose business remains\nexceptional for precisely the same reasons that prevailed in\n1951. In addition, GEICO has two extraordinary managers: Tony\nNicely, who runs the insurance side of the operation, and Lou\nSimpson, who runs investments.\n\nTony, 52, has been with GEICO for 34 years. There's no one\nI would rather have managing GEICO's insurance operation. He has\nbrains, energy, integrity and focus. If we're lucky, he'll stay\nanother 34 years.\n\nLou runs investments just as ably. Between 1980 and 1995,\nthe equities under Lou's management returned an average of 22.8%\nannually vs. 15.7% for the S&P. Lou takes the same conservative,\nconcentrated approach to investments that we do at Berkshire, and\nit is an enormous plus for us to have him on board. One point\nthat goes beyond Lou's GEICO work: His presence on the scene\nassures us that Berkshire would have an extraordinary\nprofessional immediately available to handle its investments if\nsomething were to happen to Charlie and me.",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\nIn addition to acquiring GEICO, we enjoyed other favorable\ndevelopments in insurance during 1995.\n\nAs we've explained in past reports, what counts in our\ninsurance business is, first, the amount of \"float\" we generate\nand, second, its cost to us. Float is money we hold but don't\nown. In an insurance operation, float arises because most\npolicies require that premiums be prepaid and, more importantly,\nbecause it usually takes time for an insurer to hear about and\nresolve loss claims.\n\nTypically, the premiums that an insurer takes in do not\ncover the losses and expenses it must pay. That leaves it\nrunning an \"underwriting loss\" - and that loss is the cost of\nfloat. An insurance business is profitable over time if its cost\nof float is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur\nto obtain funds. But the business has a negative value if the\ncost of its float is higher than market rates for money.\n\nAs the numbers in the following table show, Berkshire's\ninsurance business has been a huge winner. For the table, we\nhave calculated our float - which we generate in exceptional\namounts relative to our premium volume - by adding loss reserves,\nloss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed\nand unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents'\nbalances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred\ncharges applicable to assumed reinsurance. Our cost of float is\ndetermined by our underwriting loss or profit. In those years\nwhen we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last three,\nour cost of float has been negative, which means we have\ncalculated our insurance earnings by adding underwriting profit\nto float income.\n\n(1) (2) Yearend Yield\nUnderwriting Approximate on Long-Term\nLoss Average Float Cost of Funds Govt.

In more years\nthan not, our cost of funds has been less than nothing. This\naccess to \"free\" money has boosted Berkshire's performance in a\nmajor way.\n\nAny company's level of profitability is determined by three\nitems: (1) what its assets earn; (2) what its liabilities cost;\nand (3) its utilization of \"leverage\" - that is, the degree to\nwhich its assets are funded by liabilities rather than by equity.\nOver the years, we have done well on Point 1, having produced high\nreturns on our assets. But we have also benefitted greatly - to a\ndegree that is not generally well-understood - because our\nliabilities have cost us very little. An important reason for this\nlow cost is that we have obtained float on very advantageous terms.\nThe same cannot be said by many other property and casualty\ninsurers, who may generate plenty of float, but at a cost that\nexceeds what the funds are worth to them. In those circumstances,\nleverage becomes a disadvantage.\n\nSince our float has cost us virtually nothing over the years,\nit has in effect served as equity. Of course, it differs from true\nequity in that it doesn't belong to us. Nevertheless, let's assume\nthat instead of our having $3.4 billion of float at the end of\n1994, we had replaced it with $3.4 billion of equity. Under this\nscenario, we would have owned no more assets than we did during\n1995. We would, however, have had somewhat lower earnings because\nthe cost of float was negative last year. That is, our float threw\noff profits. And, of course, to obtain the replacement equity, we\nwould have needed to sell many new shares of Berkshire. The net\nresult - more shares, equal assets and lower earnings - would have\nmaterially reduced the value of our stock. So you can understand\nwhy float wonderfully benefits a business -\nif\nit is obtained at a\nlow cost.\n\nOur acquisition of GEICO will immediately increase our float\nby nearly $3 billion, with additional growth almost certain. We\nalso expect GEICO to operate at a decent underwriting profit in\nmost years, a fact that will increase the probability that our\ntotal float will cost us nothing. Of course, we paid a very\nsubstantial price for the GEICO float, whereas virtually all of the\ngains in float depicted in the table were developed internally.\n\nOur enthusiasm over 1995's insurance results must be tempered\nonce again because we had our third straight year of good fortune\nin the super-cat business. In this operation, we sell policies\nthat insurance and reinsurance companies buy to protect themselves\nfrom the effects of mega-catastrophes. Since truly major\ncatastrophes occur infrequently, our super-cat business can be\nexpected to show large profits in most years but occasionally to\nrecord a huge loss. In other words, the attractiveness of our\nsuper-cat business will take many years to measure. We know that\nthe results of years like the past three will be at least partially\noffset by some truly terrible year in the future. We just hope\nthat \"partially\" turns out to be the proper adverb.\n\nThere were plenty of catastrophes last year, but no super-cats\nof the insured variety. The Southeast had a close call when Opal,\nsporting winds of 150 miles per hour, hovered off Florida.\nHowever, the storm abated before hitting land, and so a second\nAndrew was dodged. For insurers, the Kobe earthquake was another\nclose call: The economic damage was huge - perhaps even a record -\nbut only a tiny portion of it was insured. The insurance industry\nwon't always be that lucky.\n\nAjit Jain is the guiding genius of our super-cat business and\nwrites important non-cat business as well. In insurance, the term\n\"catastrophe\" is applied to an event, such as a hurricane or\nearthquake, that causes a great many insured losses. The other\ndeals Ajit enters into usually cover only a single large loss. A\nsimplified description of three transactions from last year will\nillustrate both what I mean and Ajit's versatility. We insured: (1)\nThe life of Mike Tyson for a sum that is large initially and that,\nfight-by-fight, gradually declines to zero over the next few years;\n(2) Lloyd's against more than 225 of its \"names\" dying during the\nyear; and (3) The launch, and a year of orbit, of two Chinese\nsatellites. Happily, both satellites are orbiting, the Lloyd's folk\navoided abnormal mortality, and if Mike Tyson looked any healthier,\nno one would get in the ring with him.\n\nBerkshire is sought out for many kinds of insurance, both\nsuper-cat and large single-risk, because: (1) our financial\nstrength is unmatched, and insureds know we can and will pay our\nlosses under the most adverse of circumstances; (2) we can supply a\nquote faster than anyone in the business; and (3) we will issue\npolicies with limits larger than anyone else is prepared to write.\nMost of our competitors have extensive reinsurance treaties and\nlay off much of their business. While this helps them avoid shock\nlosses, it also hurts their flexibility and reaction time. As you\nknow, Berkshire moves quickly to seize investment and acquisition\nopportunities; in insurance we respond with the same exceptional\nspeed. In another important point, large coverages don't frighten\nus but, on the contrary, intensify our interest. We have offered a\n\npolicy\nunder which we could have lost $1 billion; the largest\ncoverage that a client\naccepted\nwas $400 million.\n\nWe will get hit from time to time with large losses. Charlie\nand I, however, are quite willing to accept relatively volatile\nresults in exchange for better long-term earnings than we would\notherwise have had. In other words, we prefer a lumpy 15% to a\nsmooth 12%. Since most managers opt for smoothness, we are left\nwith a competitive advantage that we try to maximize. We do,\nthough, monitor our aggregate exposure in order to keep our \"worst\ncase\" at a level that leaves us comfortable.\n\nIndeed, our worst case from a \"once-in-a-century\" super-cat is\nfar less severe - relative to net worth - than that faced by many\nwell-known primary companies writing great numbers of property\npolicies. These insurers don't issue single huge-limit policies as\nwe do, but their small policies, in aggregate, can create a risk of\nstaggering size. The \"big one\" would blow right through the\nreinsurance covers of some of these insurers, exposing them to\nuncapped losses that could threaten their survival. In our case,\nlosses would be large, but capped at levels we could easily handle.\n\nPrices are weakening in the super-cat field. That is\nunderstandable considering the influx of capital into the\nreinsurance business a few years ago and the natural desire of\nthose holding the capital to employ it. No matter what others may\ndo, we will not knowingly write business at inadequate rates. We\nunwittingly did this in the early 1970's and, after more than 20\nyears, regularly receive significant bills stemming from the\nmistakes of that era. My guess is that we will still be getting\nsurprises from that business 20 years from now. A bad reinsurance\ncontract is like hell: easy to enter and impossible to exit.\n\nI actively participated in those early reinsurance decisions,\nand Berkshire paid a heavy tuition for my education in the\nbusiness. Unfortunately, reinsurance students can't attend school\non scholarship. GEICO, incidentally, suffered a similar,\ndisastrous experience in the early 1980's, when it plunged\nenthusiastically into the writing of reinsurance and large risks.\nGEICO's folly was brief, but it will be cleaning things up for at\nleast another decade. The well-publicized problems at Lloyd's\nfurther illustrate the perils of reinsurance and also underscore\nhow vital it is that the interests of the people who write\ninsurance business be aligned - on the downside as well as the\nupside - with those of the people putting up the capital. When\nthat kind of symmetry is missing, insurers almost invariably run\ninto trouble, though its existence may remain hidden for some time.\n\nA small, apocryphal story about an insurance CEO who was\nvisited by an analyst tells a lot about this industry. To the\nanalyst's questions about his business, the CEO had nothing but\ngloomy answers: Rates were ridiculously low; the reserves on his\nbalance sheet weren't adequate for ordinary claims, much less those\nlikely to arise from asbestos and environmental problems; most of\nhis reinsurers had long since gone broke, leaving him holding the\nsack. But then the CEO brightened: \"Still, things could be a lot\nworse,\" he said. \"It could be\nmy\nmoney.\" At Berkshire, it's\nour\n\nmoney.\n\nBerkshire's other insurance operations, though relatively\nsmall, performed magnificently in 1995. National Indemnity's\ntraditional business had a combined ratio of 84.2 and developed, as\nusual, a large amount of float compared to premium volume. Over\nthe last three years, this segment of our business, run by Don\nWurster, has had an average combined ratio of 85.6. Our homestate\noperation, managed by Rod Eldred, grew at a good rate in 1995 and\nachieved a combined ratio of 81.4. Its three-year combined ratio\nis an amazing 82.4. Berkshire's California workers' compensation\nbusiness, run by Brad Kinstler, faced fierce price-cutting in 1995\nand lost a great many renewals when we refused to accept inadequate\nrates. Though this operation's volume dropped materially, it\nproduced an excellent underwriting profit. Finally, John Kizer, at\nCentral States Indemnity, continues to do an extraordinary job.\nHis premium volume was up 23% in 1995, and underwriting profit grew\nby 59%. Ajit, Don, Rod, Brad and John are all under 45, an\nembarrassing fact demolishing my theory that managers only hit\ntheir stride after they reach 70.\n\nTo sum up, we entered 1995 with an exceptional insurance\noperation of moderate size. By adding GEICO, we entered 1996 with\na business still better in quality, much improved in its growth\nprospects, and doubled in size. More than ever, insurance is our\ncore strength.",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\nIn addition to acquiring GEICO, we enjoyed other favorable\ndevelopments in insurance during 1995.\n\nAs we've explained in past reports, what counts in our\ninsurance business is, first, the amount of \"float\" we generate\nand, second, its cost to us. Float is money we hold but don't\nown. In an insurance operation, float arises because most\npolicies require that premiums be prepaid and, more importantly,\nbecause it usually takes time for an insurer to hear about and\nresolve loss claims.\n\nTypically, the premiums that an insurer takes in do not\ncover the losses and expenses it must pay. That leaves it\nrunning an \"underwriting loss\" - and that loss is the cost of\nfloat. An insurance business is profitable over time if its cost\nof float is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur\nto obtain funds. But the business has a negative value if the\ncost of its float is higher than market rates for money.\n\nAs the numbers in the following table show, Berkshire's\ninsurance business has been a huge winner. For the table, we\nhave calculated our float - which we generate in exceptional\namounts relative to our premium volume - by adding loss reserves,\nloss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed\nand unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents'\nbalances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred\ncharges applicable to assumed reinsurance. Our cost of float is\ndetermined by our underwriting loss or profit. In those years\nwhen we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last three,\nour cost of float has been negative, which means we have\ncalculated our insurance earnings by adding underwriting profit\nto float income.\n\n(1) (2) Yearend Yield\nUnderwriting Approximate on Long-Term\nLoss Average Float Cost of Funds Govt.

But we have also benefitted greatly - to a\ndegree that is not generally well-understood - because our\nliabilities have cost us very little. An important reason for this\nlow cost is that we have obtained float on very advantageous terms.\nThe same cannot be said by many other property and casualty\ninsurers, who may generate plenty of float, but at a cost that\nexceeds what the funds are worth to them. In those circumstances,\nleverage becomes a disadvantage.\n\nSince our float has cost us virtually nothing over the years,\nit has in effect served as equity. Of course, it differs from true\nequity in that it doesn't belong to us. Nevertheless, let's assume\nthat instead of our having $3.4 billion of float at the end of\n1994, we had replaced it with $3.4 billion of equity. Under this\nscenario, we would have owned no more assets than we did during\n1995. We would, however, have had somewhat lower earnings because\nthe cost of float was negative last year. That is, our float threw\noff profits. And, of course, to obtain the replacement equity, we\nwould have needed to sell many new shares of Berkshire. The net\nresult - more shares, equal assets and lower earnings - would have\nmaterially reduced the value of our stock. So you can understand\nwhy float wonderfully benefits a business -\nif\nit is obtained at a\nlow cost.\n\nOur acquisition of GEICO will immediately increase our float\nby nearly $3 billion, with additional growth almost certain. We\nalso expect GEICO to operate at a decent underwriting profit in\nmost years, a fact that will increase the probability that our\ntotal float will cost us nothing. Of course, we paid a very\nsubstantial price for the GEICO float, whereas virtually all of the\ngains in float depicted in the table were developed internally.",

In this operation, we sell policies\nthat insurance and reinsurance companies buy to protect themselves\nfrom the effects of mega-catastrophes. Since truly major\ncatastrophes occur infrequently, our super-cat business can be\nexpected to show large profits in most years but occasionally to\nrecord a huge loss. In other words, the attractiveness of our\nsuper-cat business will take many years to measure. We know that\nthe results of years like the past three will be at least partially\noffset by some truly terrible year in the future. We just hope\nthat \"partially\" turns out to be the proper adverb.\n\nThere were plenty of catastrophes last year, but no super-cats\nof the insured variety. The Southeast had a close call when Opal,\nsporting winds of 150 miles per hour, hovered off Florida.\nHowever, the storm abated before hitting land, and so a second\nAndrew was dodged. For insurers, the Kobe earthquake was another\nclose call: The economic damage was huge - perhaps even a record -\nbut only a tiny portion of it was insured. The insurance industry\nwon't always be that lucky.\n\nAjit Jain is the guiding genius of our super-cat business and\nwrites important non-cat business as well. In insurance, the term\n\"catastrophe\" is applied to an event, such as a hurricane or\nearthquake, that causes a great many insured losses. The other\ndeals Ajit enters into usually cover only a single large loss. A\nsimplified description of three transactions from last year will\nillustrate both what I mean and Ajit's versatility. We insured: (1)\nThe life of Mike Tyson for a sum that is large initially and that,\nfight-by-fight, gradually declines to zero over the next few years;\n(2) Lloyd's against more than 225 of its \"names\" dying during the\nyear; and (3) The launch, and a year of orbit, of two Chinese\nsatellites. Happily, both satellites are orbiting, the Lloyd's folk\navoided abnormal mortality, and if Mike Tyson looked any healthier,\nno one would get in the ring with him.",

While this helps them avoid shock\nlosses, it also hurts their flexibility and reaction time. As you\nknow, Berkshire moves quickly to seize investment and acquisition\nopportunities; in insurance we respond with the same exceptional\nspeed. In another important point, large coverages don't frighten\nus but, on the contrary, intensify our interest. We have offered a\n\npolicy\nunder which we could have lost $1 billion; the largest\ncoverage that a client\naccepted\nwas $400 million.\n\nWe will get hit from time to time with large losses. Charlie\nand I, however, are quite willing to accept relatively volatile\nresults in exchange for better long-term earnings than we would\notherwise have had. In other words, we prefer a lumpy 15% to a\nsmooth 12%. Since most managers opt for smoothness, we are left\nwith a competitive advantage that we try to maximize. We do,\nthough, monitor our aggregate exposure in order to keep our \"worst\ncase\" at a level that leaves us comfortable.\n\nIndeed, our worst case from a \"once-in-a-century\" super-cat is\nfar less severe - relative to net worth - than that faced by many\nwell-known primary companies writing great numbers of property\npolicies. These insurers don't issue single huge-limit policies as\nwe do, but their small policies, in aggregate, can create a risk of\nstaggering size. The \"big one\" would blow right through the\nreinsurance covers of some of these insurers, exposing them to\nuncapped losses that could threaten their survival. In our case,\nlosses would be large, but capped at levels we could easily handle.",

    "content": "Prices are weakening in the super-cat field. That is\nunderstandable considering the influx of capital into the\nreinsurance business a few years ago and the natural desire of\nthose holding the capital to employ it. No matter what others may\ndo, we will not knowingly write business at inadequate rates. We\nunwittingly did this in the early 1970's and, after more than 20\nyears, regularly receive significant bills stemming from the\nmistakes of that era. My guess is that we will still be getting\nsurprises from that business 20 years from now. A bad reinsurance\ncontract is like hell: easy to enter and impossible to exit.\n\nI actively participated in those early reinsurance decisions,\nand Berkshire paid a heavy tuition for my education in the\nbusiness. Unfortunately, reinsurance students can't attend school\non scholarship. GEICO, incidentally, suffered a similar,\ndisastrous experience in the early 1980's, when it plunged\nenthusiastically into the writing of reinsurance and large risks.\nGEICO's folly was brief, but it will be cleaning things up for at\nleast another decade. The well-publicized problems at Lloyd's\nfurther illustrate the perils of reinsurance and also underscore\nhow vital it is that the interests of the people who write\ninsurance business be aligned - on the downside as well as the\nupside - with those of the people putting up the capital. When\nthat kind of symmetry is missing, insurers almost invariably run\ninto trouble, though its existence may remain hidden for some time.\n\nA small, apocryphal story about an insurance CEO who was\nvisited by an analyst tells a lot about this industry. To the\nanalyst's questions about his business, the CEO had nothing but\ngloomy answers: Rates were ridiculously low; the reserves on his\nbalance sheet weren't adequate for ordinary claims, much less those\nlikely to arise from asbestos and environmental problems; most of\nhis reinsurers had long since gone broke, leaving him holding the\nsack. But then the CEO brightened: \"Still, things could be a lot\nworse,\" he said. \"It could be\nmy\nmoney.\" At Berkshire, it's\nour\n\nmoney.",

National Indemnity's\ntraditional business had a combined ratio of 84.2 and developed, as\nusual, a large amount of float compared to premium volume. Over\nthe last three years, this segment of our business, run by Don\nWurster, has had an average combined ratio of 85.6. Our homestate\noperation, managed by Rod Eldred, grew at a good rate in 1995 and\nachieved a combined ratio of 81.4. Its three-year combined ratio\nis an amazing 82.4. Berkshire's California workers' compensation\nbusiness, run by Brad Kinstler, faced fierce price-cutting in 1995\nand lost a great many renewals when we refused to accept inadequate\nrates. Though this operation's volume dropped materially, it\nproduced an excellent underwriting profit. Finally, John Kizer, at\nCentral States Indemnity, continues to do an extraordinary job.\nHis premium volume was up 23% in 1995, and underwriting profit grew\nby 59%. Ajit, Don, Rod, Brad and John are all under 45, an\nembarrassing fact demolishing my theory that managers only hit\ntheir stride after they reach 70.\n\nTo sum up, we entered 1995 with an exceptional insurance\noperation of moderate size. By adding GEICO, we entered 1996 with\na business still better in quality, much improved in its growth\nprospects, and doubled in size. More than ever, insurance is our\ncore strength.",

In addition, on pages 57-63, we have\nrearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments on a non GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and\nI think about the company. Our intent is to supply you with the\nfinancial information that we would wish you to give us if our\npositions were reversed.\n\nAt Berkshire, we believe in Charlie's dictum - \"Just tell me\nthe bad news; the good news will take care of itself\" - and that is\nthe behavior we expect of our managers when they are reporting to\nus. Consequently, I also owe you - Berkshire's owners - a report\non three operations that, though they continued to earn decent (or\nbetter) returns on invested capital, experienced a decline in\nearnings last year. Each encountered a different type of problem.\n\nOur shoe business operated in an industry that suffered\ndepressed earnings throughout last year, and many of our\ncompetitors made only marginal profits or worse. That means we at\nleast maintained, and in some instances widened, our competitive\nsuperiority. So I have no doubt that our shoe operations will\nclimb back to top-grade earnings in the future. In other words,\nthough the turn has not yet occurred, we believe you should view\nlast year's figures as reflecting a cyclical problem, not a secular\none.\n\nThe Buffalo News, though still doing very well in comparison\nto other newspapers, is another story. In this case, industry\ntrends are not good. In the 1991 Annual Report, I explained that\nnewspapers had lost a notch in their economic attractiveness from\nthe days when they appeared to have a bullet-proof franchise.\nToday, the industry retains its excellent economics, but has lost\nstill another notch. Over time, we expect the competitive strength\nof newspapers to gradually erode, though the industry should\nnevertheless remain a fine business for many years to come.\n\nBerkshire's most difficult problem is World Book, which\noperates in an industry beset by increasingly tough competition\nfrom CD-ROM and on-line offerings. True, we are still profitable,\na claim that perhaps no other print encyclopedia can make. But our\nsales and earnings trends have gone in the wrong direction. At the\nend of 1995, World Book made major changes in the way it\ndistributes its product, stepped up its efforts with electronic\nproducts and sharply reduced its overhead costs. It will take time\nfor us to evaluate the effects of these initiatives, but we are\nconfident they will significantly improve our viability.\n\nAll of our operations, including those whose earnings fell\nlast year, benefit from exceptionally talented and dedicated\nmanagers. Were we to have the choice of any other executives now\nworking in their industries, there is not one of our managers we\nwould replace.\n\nMany of our managers don't have to work for a living, but\nsimply go out and perform every day for the same reason that\nwealthy golfers stay on the tour: They love both doing what they\ndo and doing it well. To describe them as working may be a\nmisnomer - they simply prefer spending much of their time on a\nproductive activity at which they excel to spending it on leisure\nactivities. Our job is to provide an environment that will keep\nthem feeling this way, and so far we seem to have succeeded:\nThinking back over the 1965-95 period, I can't recall that a single\nkey manager has left Berkshire to join another employer.",

In addition, on pages 57-63, we have\nrearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments on a non GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and\nI think about the company. Our intent is to supply you with the\nfinancial information that we would wish you to give us if our\npositions were reversed.\n\nAt Berkshire, we believe in Charlie's dictum - \"Just tell me\nthe bad news; the good news will take care of itself\" - and that is\nthe behavior we expect of our managers when they are reporting to\nus. Consequently, I also owe you - Berkshire's owners - a report\non three operations that, though they continued to earn decent (or\nbetter) returns on invested capital, experienced a decline in\nearnings last year. Each encountered a different type of problem.\n\nOur shoe business operated in an industry that suffered\ndepressed earnings throughout last year, and many of our\ncompetitors made only marginal profits or worse. That means we at\nleast maintained, and in some instances widened, our competitive\nsuperiority. So I have no doubt that our shoe operations will\nclimb back to top-grade earnings in the future. In other words,\nthough the turn has not yet occurred, we believe you should view\nlast year's figures as reflecting a cyclical problem, not a secular\none.\n\nThe Buffalo News, though still doing very well in comparison\nto other newspapers, is another story. In this case, industry\ntrends are not good. In the 1991 Annual Report, I explained that\nnewspapers had lost a notch in their economic attractiveness from\nthe days when they appeared to have a bullet-proof franchise.\nToday, the industry retains its excellent economics, but has lost\nstill another notch. Over time, we expect the competitive strength\nof newspapers to gradually erode, though the industry should\nnevertheless remain a fine business for many years to come.",

True, we are still profitable,\na claim that perhaps no other print encyclopedia can make. But our\nsales and earnings trends have gone in the wrong direction. At the\nend of 1995, World Book made major changes in the way it\ndistributes its product, stepped up its efforts with electronic\nproducts and sharply reduced its overhead costs. It will take time\nfor us to evaluate the effects of these initiatives, but we are\nconfident they will significantly improve our viability.\n\nAll of our operations, including those whose earnings fell\nlast year, benefit from exceptionally talented and dedicated\nmanagers. Were we to have the choice of any other executives now\nworking in their industries, there is not one of our managers we\nwould replace.\n\nMany of our managers don't have to work for a living, but\nsimply go out and perform every day for the same reason that\nwealthy golfers stay on the tour: They love both doing what they\ndo and doing it well. To describe them as working may be a\nmisnomer - they simply prefer spending much of their time on a\nproductive activity at which they excel to spending it on leisure\nactivities. Our job is to provide an environment that will keep\nthem feeling this way, and so far we seem to have succeeded:\nThinking back over the 1965-95 period, I can't recall that a single\nkey manager has left Berkshire to join another employer.",

    "content": "Convertible Preferred Stocks\n\nAs many of you will remember, Berkshire made five private\npurchases of convertible preferred stocks during the 1987-91 period\nand the time seems right to discuss their status. Here are the\nparticulars:\n\nDividend Year of Market\nCompany Rate Purchase Cost Value\n------- -------- -------- ------ --------\n\n(dollars in millions)\n\nChampion International Corp. ... 9 1/4% 1989 $300 $388(1)\nFirst Empire State Corp. ....... 9% 1991 40 110\nThe Gillette Company ........... 8 3/4% 1989 600 2,502(2)\nSalomon Inc .................... 9% 1987 700 728(3)\nUSAir Group, Inc. .............. 9 1/4% 1989 358 215\n\n(1) Proceeds from sale of common we received through conversion in 1995.\n(2) 12/31/95 value of common we received through conversion in 1991.\n(3) Includes $140 we received in 1995 from partial redemption.\n\nIn each case we had the option of sticking with these\npreferreds as fixed-income securities or converting them into\ncommon stock. Initially, their value to us came primarily from\ntheir fixed-income characteristics. The option we had to convert\nwas a kicker.\n\nOur $300 million private purchase of American Express \"Percs\"\n- described in the 1991 Annual Report - is not included in the\ntable because that security was a modified form of common stock\nwhose fixed-income characteristics contributed only a minor portion\nof its initial value. Three years after we bought them, the Percs\nautomatically were converted to common stock. In contrast, the\nfive securities in the table were set to become common stocks only\nif we wished them to - a crucial difference.\n\nWhen we purchased our convertible securities, I told you that\nwe expected to earn after-tax returns from them that \"moderately\"\nexceeded what we could earn from the medium-term fixed-income\nsecurities they replaced. We beat this expectation - but only\nbecause of the performance of a single issue. I also told you that\nthese securities, as a group, would \"not produce the returns we can\nachieve when we find a business with wonderful economic prospects.\"\nUnfortunately, that prediction was fulfilled. Finally, I said\nthat \"under almost any conditions, we expect these preferreds to\nreturn us our money plus dividends.\" That's one I would like to\nhave back. Winston Churchill once said that \"eating my words has\nnever given me indigestion.\" My assertion, however, that it was\nalmost impossible for us to lose money on our preferreds has caused\nme some well-deserved heartburn.\n\nOur best holding has been Gillette, which we told you from the\nstart was a superior business. Ironically, though, this is also\nthe purchase in which I made my biggest mistake - of a kind,\nhowever, never recognized on financial statements.\n\nWe paid $600 million in 1989 for Gillette preferred shares\nthat were convertible into 48 million (split-adjusted) common\nshares. Taking an alternative route with the $600 million, I\nprobably could have purchased 60 million shares of common from the\ncompany. The market on the common was then about $10.50, and given\nthat this would have been a huge private placement carrying\nimportant restrictions, I probably could have bought the stock at a\ndiscount of at least 5%. I can't be sure about this, but it's\nlikely that Gillette's management would have been just as happy to\nhave Berkshire opt for common.\n\nBut I was far too clever to do that. Instead, for less than\ntwo years, we received some extra dividend income (the difference\nbetween the preferred's yield and that of the common), at which\npoint the company - quite properly - called the issue, moving to do\nthat as quickly as was possible. If I had negotiated for common\nrather than preferred, we would have been better off at yearend\n1995 by $625 million, minus the \"excess\" dividends of about $70\nmillion.\n\nIn the case of Champion, the ability of the company to call\nour preferred at 115% of cost forced a move out of us last August\nthat we would rather have delayed. In this instance, we converted\nour shares just prior to the pending call and offered them to the\ncompany at a modest discount.\n\nCharlie and I have never had a conviction about the paper\nindustry - actually, I can't remember ever owning the common stock\nof a paper producer in my 54 years of investing - so our choice in\nAugust was whether to sell in the market or to the company.\nChampion's management had always been candid and honorable in\ndealing with us and wished to repurchase common shares, so we\noffered our stock to the company. Our Champion capital gain was\nmoderate - about 19% after tax from a six-year investment - but the\npreferred delivered us a good after-tax dividend yield throughout\nour holding period. (That said, many press accounts have\noverstated the after-tax yields earned by property-casualty\ninsurance companies on dividends paid to them. What the press has\nfailed to take into account is a change in the tax law that took\neffect in 1987 and that significantly reduced the dividends\nreceived credit applicable to insurers. For details, see our 1986\nAnnual Report.)\n\nOur First Empire preferred will be called on March 31,1996,\nthe earliest date allowable. We are comfortable owning stock in\nwell-run banks, and we will convert and keep our First Empire\ncommon shares. Bob Wilmers, CEO of the company, is an outstanding\nbanker, and we love being associated with him.\n\nOur other two preferreds have been disappointing, though the\nSalomon preferred has modestly outperformed the fixed-income\nsecurities for which it was a substitute. However, the amount of\nmanagement time Charlie and I have devoted to this holding has been\nvastly greater than its economic significance to Berkshire.\nCertainly I never dreamed I would take a new job at age 60 -\nSalomon interim chairman, that is - because of an earlier purchase\nof a fixed-income security.\n\nSoon after our purchase of the Salomon preferred in 1987, I\nwrote that I had \"no special insights regarding the direction or\nfuture profitability of investment banking.\" Even the most\ncharitable commentator would conclude that I have since proved my\npoint.\n\nTo date, our option to convert into Salomon common has not\nproven of value. Furthermore, the Dow Industrials have doubled\nsince I committed to buy the preferred, and the brokerage group has\nperformed equally as well. That means my decision to go with\nSalomon because I saw value in the conversion option must be graded\nas very poor. Even so, the preferred has continued under some\ntrying conditions to deliver as a fixed-income security, and the\n9% dividend is currently quite attractive.\n\nUnless the preferred is converted, its terms require\nredemption of 20% of the issue on October 31 of each year, 1995-99,\nand $140 million of our original $700 million was taken on schedule\nlast year. (Some press reports labeled this a sale, but a senior\nsecurity that matures is not \"sold.\") Though we did not elect to\nconvert the preferred that matured last year, we have four more\nbites at the conversion apple, and I believe it quite likely that\nwe will yet find value in our right to convert.\n\nI discussed the USAir investment at length in last year's\nreport. The company's results improved in 1995, but it still faces\nsignificant problems. On the plus side for us is the fact that our\npreferred is structurally well-designed: For example, though we\nhave not been paid dividends since June 1994, the amounts owed us\nare compounding at 5% over the prime rate. On the minus side is\nthe fact that we are dealing with a weak credit.\n\nWe feel much better about our USAir preferred than we did a\nyear ago, but your guess is as good as mine as to its ultimate\nvalue. (Indeed, considering my record with this investment, it's\nfair to say that your guess may be\nbetter\nthan mine.) At yearend\nwe carried our preferred (in which there is no public market) at\n60% of par, though USAir also has outstanding a junior preferred\nthat is significantly inferior to ours in all respects except\nconversion price and that was then trading at 82% of par. As I\nwrite this, the junior issue has advanced to 97% of par. Let's\nhope the market is right.\n\nOverall, our preferreds have performed well, but that is true\nonly because of one huge winner, Gillette. Leaving aside Gillette,\nour preferreds as a group have delivered us after-tax returns no\nmore than equal to those we could have earned from the medium-term\nfixed-income issues that they replaced.",

We beat this expectation - but only\nbecause of the performance of a single issue. I also told you that\nthese securities, as a group, would \"not produce the returns we can\nachieve when we find a business with wonderful economic prospects.\"\nUnfortunately, that prediction was fulfilled. Finally, I said\nthat \"under almost any conditions, we expect these preferreds to\nreturn us our money plus dividends.\" That's one I would like to\nhave back. Winston Churchill once said that \"eating my words has\nnever given me indigestion.\" My assertion, however, that it was\nalmost impossible for us to lose money on our preferreds has caused\nme some well-deserved heartburn.\n\nOur best holding has been Gillette, which we told you from the\nstart was a superior business. Ironically, though, this is also\nthe purchase in which I made my biggest mistake - of a kind,\nhowever, never recognized on financial statements.\n\nWe paid $600 million in 1989 for Gillette preferred shares\nthat were convertible into 48 million (split-adjusted) common\nshares. Taking an alternative route with the $600 million, I\nprobably could have purchased 60 million shares of common from the\ncompany. The market on the common was then about $10.50, and given\nthat this would have been a huge private placement carrying\nimportant restrictions, I probably could have bought the stock at a\ndiscount of at least 5%. I can't be sure about this, but it's\nlikely that Gillette's management would have been just as happy to\nhave Berkshire opt for common.\n\nBut I was far too clever to do that. Instead, for less than\ntwo years, we received some extra dividend income (the difference\nbetween the preferred's yield and that of the common), at which\npoint the company - quite properly - called the issue, moving to do\nthat as quickly as was possible. If I had negotiated for common\nrather than preferred, we would have been better off at yearend\n1995 by $625 million, minus the \"excess\" dividends of about $70\nmillion.",

In this instance, we converted\nour shares just prior to the pending call and offered them to the\ncompany at a modest discount.\n\nCharlie and I have never had a conviction about the paper\nindustry - actually, I can't remember ever owning the common stock\nof a paper producer in my 54 years of investing - so our choice in\nAugust was whether to sell in the market or to the company.\nChampion's management had always been candid and honorable in\ndealing with us and wished to repurchase common shares, so we\noffered our stock to the company. Our Champion capital gain was\nmoderate - about 19% after tax from a six-year investment - but the\npreferred delivered us a good after-tax dividend yield throughout\nour holding period. (That said, many press accounts have\noverstated the after-tax yields earned by property-casualty\ninsurance companies on dividends paid to them. What the press has\nfailed to take into account is a change in the tax law that took\neffect in 1987 and that significantly reduced the dividends\nreceived credit applicable to insurers. For details, see our 1986\nAnnual Report.)\n\nOur First Empire preferred will be called on March 31,1996,\nthe earliest date allowable. We are comfortable owning stock in\nwell-run banks, and we will convert and keep our First Empire\ncommon shares. Bob Wilmers, CEO of the company, is an outstanding\nbanker, and we love being associated with him.\n\nOur other two preferreds have been disappointing, though the\nSalomon preferred has modestly outperformed the fixed-income\nsecurities for which it was a substitute. However, the amount of\nmanagement time Charlie and I have devoted to this holding has been\nvastly greater than its economic significance to Berkshire.\nCertainly I never dreamed I would take a new job at age 60 -\nSalomon interim chairman, that is - because of an earlier purchase\nof a fixed-income security.",

Furthermore, the Dow Industrials have doubled\nsince I committed to buy the preferred, and the brokerage group has\nperformed equally as well. That means my decision to go with\nSalomon because I saw value in the conversion option must be graded\nas very poor. Even so, the preferred has continued under some\ntrying conditions to deliver as a fixed-income security, and the\n9% dividend is currently quite attractive.\n\nUnless the preferred is converted, its terms require\nredemption of 20% of the issue on October 31 of each year, 1995-99,\nand $140 million of our original $700 million was taken on schedule\nlast year. (Some press reports labeled this a sale, but a senior\nsecurity that matures is not \"sold.\") Though we did not elect to\nconvert the preferred that matured last year, we have four more\nbites at the conversion apple, and I believe it quite likely that\nwe will yet find value in our right to convert.\n\nI discussed the USAir investment at length in last year's\nreport.

Second,\nthe B will not be eligible to participate in Berkshire's\nshareholder-designated charitable contributions program.\n\nWhen the recapitalization is complete, each share of A will\nbecome convertible, at the holder's option and at any time, into 30\nshares of B. This conversion privilege will not extend in the\nopposite direction. That is, holders of B shares will not be able\nto convert them into A shares.\n\nWe expect to list the B shares on the New York Stock Exchange,\nwhere they will trade alongside the A stock. To create the\nshareholder base necessary for a listing - and to ensure a liquid\nmarket in the B stock - Berkshire expects to make a public offering\nfor cash of at least $100 million of new B shares. The offering\nwill be made only by means of a prospectus.\n\nThe market will ultimately determine the price of the B\nshares. Their price, though, should be in the neighborhood of\n1/30 th of the price of the A shares.\n\nClass A shareholders who wish to give gifts may find it\nconvenient to convert a share or two of their stock into Class B\nshares. Additionally, arbitrage-related conversions will occur if\ndemand for the B is strong enough to push its price to slightly\nabove 1/30 th of the price of A.\n\nHowever, because the Class A stock will entitle its holders to\nfull voting rights and access to Berkshire's contributions program,\nthese shares will be superior to the Class B shares and we would\nexpect most shareholders to remain holders of the Class A - which\nis precisely what the Buffett and Munger families plan to do,\nexcept in those instances when we ourselves might convert a few\nshares to facilitate gifts. The prospect that most shareholders\nwill stick to the A stock suggests that it will enjoy a somewhat\nmore liquid market than the B.\n\nThere are tradeoffs for Berkshire in this recapitalization.\nBut they do not arise from the proceeds of the offering - we will\nfind constructive uses for the money - nor in any degree from the\nprice at which we will sell the B shares. As I write this - with\nBerkshire stock at $36,000 - Charlie and I do not believe it\nundervalued. Therefore, the offering we propose will not diminish\nthe per-share intrinsic value of our existing stock. Let me also\nput our thoughts about valuation more baldly: Berkshire is selling\nat a price at which Charlie and I would not consider buying it.\n\nWhat Berkshire will incur by way of the B stock are certain\nadded costs, including those involving the mechanics of handling a\nlarger number of shareholders. On the other hand, the stock should\nbe a convenience for people wishing to make gifts. And those of\nyou who have hoped for a split have gained a do-it-yourself method\nof bringing one about.\n\nWe are making this move, though, for other reasons - having to\ndo with the appearance of expense-laden unit trusts purporting to\nbe low-priced \"clones\" of Berkshire and sure to be aggressively\nmarketed. The idea behind these vehicles is not new: In recent\nyears, a number of people have told me about their wish to create\nan \"all-Berkshire\" investment fund to be sold at a low dollar\nprice. But until recently, the promoters of these investments\nheard out my objections and backed off.\n\nI did not discourage these people because I prefer large\ninvestors over small. Were it possible, Charlie and I would love\nto turn $1,000 into $3,000 for multitudes of people who would find\nthat gain an important answer to their immediate problems.\n\nIn order to quickly triple small stakes, however, we would\nhave to just as quickly turn our present market capitalization of\n$43 billion into $129 billion (roughly the market cap of General\nElectric, America's most highly valued company).\nWe can't come\nclose to doing that.\nThe very best we hope for is - on average - to\ndouble Berkshire's per-share intrinsic value every five years, and\nwe may well fall far short of that goal.\n\nIn the end, Charlie and I do not care whether our shareholders\nown Berkshire in large or small amounts. What we wish for are\nshareholders of any size who are knowledgeable about our\noperations, share our objectives and long-term perspective, and are\naware of our limitations, most particularly those imposed by our\nlarge capital base.\n\nThe unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly in the face of\nthese goals. They would be sold by brokers working for big\ncommissions, would impose other burdensome costs on their\nshareholders, and would be marketed\nen masse\nto unsophisticated\nbuyers, apt to be seduced by our past record and beguiled by the\npublicity Berkshire and I have received in recent years. The sure\noutcome: a multitude of investors destined to be disappointed.\n\nThrough our creation of the B stock - a low-denomination\nproduct far superior to Berkshire-only trusts - we hope to make the\nclones unmerchandisable.\n\nBut both present and prospective Berkshire shareholders should\npay special attention to one point: Though the per-share intrinsic\nvalue of our stock has grown at an excellent rate during the past\nfive years, its market price has grown still faster. The stock, in\nother words, has outperformed the business.\n\nThat kind of market overperformance cannot persist indefinitely,\nneither for Berkshire nor any other stock.\nInevitably, there\nwill be periods of underperformance as well.\nThe price\nvolatility that results, though endemic to public markets, is\nnot to our liking. What we would prefer instead is to have the\nmarket price of Berkshire precisely track its intrinsic value.\nWere the stock to do that, every shareholder would benefit during\nhis period of ownership in exact proportion to the progress\nBerkshire itself made in the period.\n\nObviously, the market behavior of Berkshire's stock will never\nconform to this ideal. But we will come closer to this goal than\nwe would otherwise if our present and prospective shareholders are\ninformed, business-oriented and not exposed to high-commission\nsalesmanship when making their investment decisions. To that end,\nwe are better off if we can blunt the merchandising efforts of the\nunit trusts - and that is the reason we are creating the B stock.\n\nWe look forward to answering your questions about the\nrecapitalization at the Annual Meeting.",

At about 1: 15 p. m. on July 14,1995,\nMichael Eisner, CEO of The Walt Disney Company, was walking up\nWildflower Lane in Sun Valley. At the same time, I was leaving a\nlunch at Herbert Allen's home on that street to meet Tom Murphy,\nCEO of Cap Cities/ABC, for a golf game.\n\nThat morning, speaking to a large group of executives and\nmoney managers assembled by Allen's investment bank, Michael had\nmade a brilliant presentation about Disney, and upon seeing him, I\noffered my congratulations. We chatted briefly - and the subject\nof a possible combination of Disney and Cap Cities came up. This\nwasn't the first time a merger had been discussed, but progress had\nnever before been made, in part because Disney wanted to buy with\ncash and Cap Cities desired stock.\n\nMichael and I waited a few minutes for Murph to arrive, and in\nthe short conversation that ensued, both Michael and Murph\nindicated they might bend on the stock/cash question. Within a few\nweeks, they both did, at which point a contract was put together in\nthree very busy days.\n\nThe Disney/Cap Cities deal makes so much sense that I'm sure\nit would have occurred without that chance encounter in Sun Valley.\nBut when I ran into Michael that day on Wildflower Lane, he was\nheading for his plane, so without that accidental meeting the deal\ncertainly wouldn't have happened in the time frame it did. I\nbelieve both Disney and Cap Cities will benefit from the fact that\nwe all serendipitously met that day.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nIt's appropriate that I say a few words here about Murph. To\nput it simply, he is as fine an executive as I have ever seen in my\nlong exposure to business. Equally important, he possesses human\nqualities every bit the equal of his managerial qualities. He's an\nextraordinary friend, parent, husband and citizen. In those rare\ninstances in which Murph's personal interests diverged from those\nof shareholders, he unfailingly favored the owners. When I say\nthat I like to be associated with managers whom I would love to\nhave as a sibling, in-law, or trustee of my will, Murph is the\nexemplar of what I mean.\n\nIf Murph should elect to run another business, don't bother to\nstudy its value - just buy the stock. And don't later be as dumb\nas I was two years ago when I sold one-third of our holdings in Cap\nCities for $635 million (versus the $1.27 billion those shares\nwould bring in the Disney merger).\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAbout 96.3% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1995 shareholder-designated contributions program. Contributions\nmade were $11.6 million and 3,600 charities were recipients. A\nfull description of the shareholder-designated contributions\nprogram appears on pages 54-55.\n\nEvery year a few shareholders miss out on the program because\nthey don't have their shares registered in their own names on the\nprescribed record date or because they fail to get their\ndesignation form back to us within the 60-day period allowed. That\nsecond problem pained me especially this year because two good\nfriends with substantial holdings missed the deadline. We had to\ndeny their requests to be included because we can't make exceptions\nfor some shareholders while refusing to make them for others.\n\nTo participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares\nthat are registered in the name of the actual owner, not the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so\nregistered on August 31,1996, will be ineligible for the 1996\nprogram. When you get the form, return it promptly so that it does\nnot get put aside or forgotten.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nWhen it comes to our Annual Meetings, Charlie and I are\nmanagerial oddballs: We thoroughly enjoy the event. So come join\nus on Monday, May 6. At Berkshire, we have no investor relations\ndepartment and don't use financial analysts as a channel for\ndisseminating information, earnings \"guidance,\" or the like.\nInstead, we prefer direct manager-to-owner communication and\nbelieve that the Annual Meeting is the ideal place for this\ninterchange of ideas. Talking to you there is efficient for us and\nalso democratic in that all present simultaneously hear what we\nhave to say.\n\nLast year, for the first time, we had the Annual Meeting at\nthe Holiday Convention Centre and the logistics seemed to work.\nThe ballroom there was filled with about 3,200 people, and we had a\nvideo feed into a second room holding another 800 people. Seating\nin the main room was a little tight, so this year we will probably\nconfigure it to hold 3,000. This year we will also have two rooms\nfor the overflow.\n\nAll in all, we will be able to handle 5,000 shareholders. The\nmeeting will start at 9: 30 a. m., but be warned that last year the\nmain ballroom was filled shortly after 8: 00 a. m.\n\nShareholders from 49 states attended our 1995 meeting - where\nwere you, Vermont? - and a number of foreign countries, including\nAustralia, Sweden and Germany, were represented. As always, the\nmeeting attracted shareholders who were interested in Berkshire's\nbusiness - as contrasted to shareholders who are primarily\ninterested in themselves - and the questions were all good.\nCharlie and I ate lunch on stage and answered questions for about\nfive hours.\n\nWe feel that if owners come from all over the world, we should\ntry to make sure they have an opportunity to ask their questions.\nMost shareholders leave about noon, but a thousand or so hardcore\ntypes usually stay to see whether we will drop. Charlie and I are\nin training to last at least five hours again this year.\n\nWe will have our usual array of Berkshire products at the\nmeeting and this year will add a sales representative from GEICO.\nAt the 1995 meeting, we sold 747 pounds of candy, 759 pairs of\nshoes, and over $17,500 of World Books and related publications.\nIn a move that might have been dangerous had our stock been weak,\nwe added knives last year from our Quikut subsidiary and sold 400\nsets of these. (We draw the line at soft fruit, however.) All of\nthese goods will again be available this year. We don't consider a\ncultural event complete unless a little business is mixed in.\n\nBecause we expect a large crowd for the meeting, we recommend\nthat you promptly get both plane and hotel reservations. Those of\nyou who like to be downtown (about six miles from the Centre) may\nwish to stay at the Radisson Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms) but\nnice hotel, or at the much larger Red Lion Hotel a few blocks away.\nIn the vicinity of the Centre are the Holiday Inn (403 rooms),\nHomewood Suites (118 rooms) and Hampton Inn (136 rooms). Another\nrecommended spot is the Marriott, whose west Omaha location is\nabout 100 yards from Borsheim's and a ten-minute drive from the\nCentre. There will be buses at the Marriott that will leave at\n7: 30,8: 00 and 8: 30 for the meeting and return after it ends.\n\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. A\ngood-sized parking area is available at the Centre, while those who\nstay at the Holiday Inn, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn will be\nable to walk to the meeting. As usual, we will have buses to take\nyou to the Nebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting\nand to take you from there to hotels or the airport later.\n\nNFM's main store, on its 64-acre site about two miles north of\nthe Centre, is open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m. on weekdays, 10 a. m. to\n6 p. m. on Saturdays, and noon to 6 p. m. on Sundays. Rose Blumkin -\n\"Mrs. B\" - is now 102, but will be hard at work in Mrs. B's\nWarehouse. She was honored in November at the opening of The Rose,\na classic downtown theater of the 20's that has been magnificently\nrestored, but that would have been demolished had she not saved it.\nAsk her to tell you the story.\n\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders and their guests from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on May 5 th.\nAdditionally, we will have a special opening for shareholders on\nSaturday, the 4 th, from 6 p. m. to 9 p. m. Last year, on\nShareholders Day, we wrote 1,733 tickets in the six hours we were\nopen - which is a sale every 13 seconds. Remember, though, that\nrecords are made to be broken.\n\nAt Borsheim's, we will also have the world's largest faceted\ndiamond on display. Two years in the cutting, this inconspicuous\nbauble is 545 carats in size. Please inspect this stone and let it\nguide you in determining what size gem is appropriate for the one\nyou love.\n\nOn Saturday evening, May 4, there will be a baseball game at\nRosenblatt Stadium between the Omaha Royals and the Louisville\nRedbirds. I expect to make the opening pitch - owning a quarter of\nthe team assures me of one start per year - but our manager, Mike\nJirschele, will probably make his usual mistake and yank me\nimmediately after. About 1,700 shareholders attended last year's\ngame. Unfortunately, we had a rain-out, which greatly disappointed\nthe many scouts in the stands. But the smart ones will be back\nthis year, and I plan to show them my best stuff.\n\nOur proxy statement will include information about obtaining\ntickets to the game. We will also offer an information packet this\nyear listing restaurants that will be open on Sunday night and\ndescribing various things that you can do in Omaha on the weekend.\n\nFor years, I've unsuccessfully tried to get my grade school\nclassmate, \"Pal\" Gorat, to open his steakhouse for business on the\nSunday evening preceding the meeting. But this year he's relented.\nGorat's is a family-owned enterprise that has thrived for 52\nyears, and if you like steaks, you'll love this place. I've told\nPal he will get a good crowd, so call Gorat's at 402-551-3733 for a\nreservation. You'll spot me there - I'll be the one eating the\nrare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 1,1996 Chairman of the Board",

Those of\nyou who like to be downtown (about six miles from the Centre) may\nwish to stay at the Radisson Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms) but\nnice hotel, or at the much larger Red Lion Hotel a few blocks away.\nIn the vicinity of the Centre are the Holiday Inn (403 rooms),\nHomewood Suites (118 rooms) and Hampton Inn (136 rooms). Another\nrecommended spot is the Marriott, whose west Omaha location is\nabout 100 yards from Borsheim's and a ten-minute drive from the\nCentre. There will be buses at the Marriott that will leave at\n7: 30,8: 00 and 8: 30 for the meeting and return after it ends.\n\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. A\ngood-sized parking area is available at the Centre, while those who\nstay at the Holiday Inn, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn will be\nable to walk to the meeting. As usual, we will have buses to take\nyou to the Nebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting\nand to take you from there to hotels or the airport later.",

Rose Blumkin -\n\"Mrs. B\" - is now 102, but will be hard at work in Mrs. B's\nWarehouse. She was honored in November at the opening of The Rose,\na classic downtown theater of the 20's that has been magnificently\nrestored, but that would have been demolished had she not saved it.\nAsk her to tell you the story.\n\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders and their guests from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on May 5 th.\nAdditionally, we will have a special opening for shareholders on\nSaturday, the 4 th, from 6 p. m. to 9 p. m. Last year, on\nShareholders Day, we wrote 1,733 tickets in the six hours we were\nopen - which is a sale every 13 seconds. Remember, though, that\nrecords are made to be broken.\n\nAt Borsheim's, we will also have the world's largest faceted\ndiamond on display. Two years in the cutting, this inconspicuous\nbauble is 545 carats in size. Please inspect this stone and let it\nguide you in determining what size gem is appropriate for the one\nyou love.\n\nOn Saturday evening, May 4, there will be a baseball game at\nRosenblatt Stadium between the Omaha Royals and the Louisville\nRedbirds. I expect to make the opening pitch - owning a quarter of\nthe team assures me of one start per year - but our manager, Mike\nJirschele, will probably make his usual mistake and yank me\nimmediately after. About 1,700 shareholders attended last year's\ngame. Unfortunately, we had a rain-out, which greatly disappointed\nthe many scouts in the stands. But the smart ones will be back\nthis year, and I plan to show them my best stuff.\n\nOur proxy statement will include information about obtaining\ntickets to the game. We will also offer an information packet this\nyear listing restaurants that will be open on Sunday night and\ndescribing various things that you can do in Omaha on the weekend.\n\nFor years, I've unsuccessfully tried to get my grade school\nclassmate, \"Pal\" Gorat, to open his steakhouse for business on the\nSunday evening preceding the meeting. But this year he's relented.\nGorat's is a family-owned enterprise that has thrived for 52\nyears, and if you like steaks, you'll love this place. I've told\nPal he will get a good crowd, so call Gorat's at 402-551-3733 for a\nreservation. You'll spot me there - I'll be the one eating the\nrare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 1,1996 Chairman of the Board",
