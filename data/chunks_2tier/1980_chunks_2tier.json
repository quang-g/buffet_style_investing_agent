    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOperating earnings improved to $41.9 million in 1980 from\n$36.0 million in 1979, but return on beginning equity capital\n(with securities valued at cost) fell to 17.8% from 18.6%. We\nbelieve the latter yardstick to be the most appropriate measure\nof single-year managerial economic performance. Informed use of\nthat yardstick, however, requires an understanding of many\nfactors, including accounting policies, historical carrying\nvalues of assets, financial leverage, and industry conditions.\n\nIn your evaluation of our economic performance, we suggest\nthat two factors should receive your special attention - one of a\npositive nature peculiar, to a large extent, to our own\noperation, and one of a negative nature applicable to corporate\nperformance generally. Lets look at the bright side first.\n\nNon-Controlled Ownership Earnings\n\nWhen one company owns part of another company, appropriate\naccounting procedures pertaining to that ownership interest must\nbe selected from one of three major categories. The percentage\nof voting stock that is owned, in large part, determines which\ncategory of accounting principles should be utilized.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require (subject to\nexceptions, naturally, as with our former bank subsidiary) full\nconsolidation of sales, expenses, taxes, and earnings of business\nholdings more than 50% owned. Blue Chip Stamps, 60% owned by\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc., falls into this category. Therefore,\nall Blue Chip income and expense items are included in full in\nBerkshires Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with the 40%\nownership interest of others in Blue Chips net earnings\nreflected in the Statement as a deduction for minority\ninterest.\n\nFull inclusion of underlying earnings from another class of\nholdings, companies owned 20% to 50% (usually called\ninvestees), also normally occurs. Earnings from such companies\n- for example, Wesco Financial, controlled by Berkshire but only\n48% owned - are included via a one-line entry in the owners\nStatement of Earnings. Unlike the over-50% category, all items\nof revenue and expense are omitted; just the proportional share\nof net income is included. Thus, if Corporation A owns one-third\nof Corporation B, one-third of Bs earnings, whether or not\ndistributed by B, will end up in As earnings. There are some\nmodifications, both in this and the over-50% category, for\nintercorporate taxes and purchase price adjustments, the\nexplanation of which we will save for a later day. (We know you\ncan hardly wait.)\n\nFinally come holdings representing less than 20% ownership\nof another corporations voting securities. In these cases,\naccounting rules dictate that the owning companies include in\ntheir earnings only dividends received from such holdings.\nUndistributed earnings are ignored. Thus, should we own 10% of\nCorporation X with earnings of $10 million in 1980, we would\nreport in our earnings (ignoring relatively minor taxes on\nintercorporate dividends) either (a) $1 million if X declared the\nfull $10 million in dividends; (b) $500,000 if X paid out 50%, or\n$5 million, in dividends; or (c) zero if X reinvested all\nearnings.",

    "content": "We impose this short - and over-simplified - course in\naccounting upon you because Berkshires concentration of\nresources in the insurance field produces a corresponding\nconcentration of its assets in companies in that third (less than\n20% owned) category. Many of these companies pay out relatively\nsmall proportions of their earnings in dividends. This means\nthat only a small proportion of their current earning power is\nrecorded in our own current operating earnings. But, while our\nreported operating earnings reflect only the dividends received\nfrom such companies, our economic well-being is determined by\ntheir earnings, not their dividends.\n\nOur holdings in this third category of companies have\nincreased dramatically in recent years as our insurance business\nhas prospered and as securities markets have presented\nparticularly attractive opportunities in the common stock area.\nThe large increase in such holdings, plus the growth of earnings\nexperienced by those partially-owned companies, has produced an\nunusual result; the part of our earnings that these companies\nretained last year (the part not paid to us in dividends)\nexceeded the total reported annual operating earnings of\nBerkshire Hathaway. Thus, conventional accounting only allows\nless than half of our earnings iceberg to appear above the\nsurface, in plain view. Within the corporate world such a result\nis quite rare; in our case it is likely to be recurring.\n\nOur own analysis of earnings reality differs somewhat from\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, particularly when those\nprinciples must be applied in a world of high and uncertain rates\nof inflation. (But its much easier to criticize than to improve\nsuch accounting rules. The inherent problems are monumental.) We\nhave owned 100% of businesses whose reported earnings were not\nworth close to 100 cents on the dollar to us even though, in an\naccounting sense, we totally controlled their disposition. (The\ncontrol was theoretical. Unless we reinvested all earnings,\nmassive deterioration in the value of assets already in place\nwould occur. But those reinvested earnings had no prospect of\nearning anything close to a market return on capital.) We have\nalso owned small fractions of businesses with extraordinary\nreinvestment possibilities whose retained earnings had an\neconomic value to us far in excess of 100 cents on the dollar.\n\nThe value to Berkshire Hathaway of retained earnings is not\ndetermined by whether we own 100%, 50%, 20% or 1% of the\nbusinesses in which they reside. Rather, the value of those\nretained earnings is determined by the use to which they are put\nand the subsequent level of earnings produced by that usage.",

If a\ntree grows in a forest partially owned by us, but we dont record\nthe growth in our financial statements, we still own part of the\ntree.\n\nOur view, we warn you, is non-conventional. But we would\nrather have earnings for which we did not get accounting credit\nput to good use in a 10%-owned company by a management we did not\npersonally hire, than have earnings for which we did get credit\nput into projects of more dubious potential by another management\n- even if we are that management.\n\n(We cant resist pausing here for a short commercial. One\nusage of retained earnings we often greet with special enthusiasm\nwhen practiced by companies in which we have an investment\ninterest is repurchase of their own shares. The reasoning is\nsimple: if a fine business is selling in the market place for far\nless than intrinsic value, what more certain or more profitable\nutilization of capital can there be than significant enlargement\nof the interests of all owners at that bargain price? The\ncompetitive nature of corporate acquisition activity almost\nguarantees the payment of a full - frequently more than full\nprice when a company buys the entire ownership of another\nenterprise. But the auction nature of security markets often\nallows finely-run companies the opportunity to purchase portions\nof their own businesses at a price under 50% of that needed to\nacquire the same earning power through the negotiated acquisition\nof another enterprise.)",

Our long-term yardstick\nof performance, however, includes all capital gains or losses,\nrealized or unrealized. We continue to achieve a long-term\nreturn on equity that considerably exceeds the average of our\nyearly returns. The major factor causing this pleasant result is\na simple one: the retained earnings of those non-controlled\nholdings we discussed earlier have been translated into gains in\nmarket value.\n\nOf course, this translation of retained earnings into market\nprice appreciation is highly uneven (it goes in reverse some\nyears), unpredictable as to timing, and unlikely to materialize\non a precise dollar-for-dollar basis. And a silly purchase price\nfor a block of stock in a corporation can negate the effects of a\ndecade of earnings retention by that corporation. But when\npurchase prices are sensible, some long-term market recognition\nof the accumulation of retained earnings almost certainly will\noccur. Periodically you even will receive some frosting on the\ncake, with market appreciation far exceeding post-purchase\nretained earnings.\n\nIn the sixteen years since present management assumed\nresponsibility for Berkshire, book value per share with\ninsurance-held equities valued at market has increased from\n$19.46 to $400.80, or 20.5% compounded annually.

Following this policy, we would\nexpect our long-term returns to continue to exceed the returns\nderived annually from reported operating earnings. Our\nconfidence in this belief can easily be quantified: if we were to\nsell the equities that we hold and replace them with long-term\ntax-free bonds, our reported operating earnings would rise\nimmediately by over $30 million annually. Such a shift tempts us\nnot at all.\n\nSo much for the good news.",

This\nhurdle rate the return on equity that must be achieved by a\ncorporation in order to produce any real return for its\nindividual owners - has increased dramatically in recent years.\nThe average tax-paying investor is now running up a down\nescalator whose pace has accelerated to the point where his\nupward progress is nil.\n\nFor example, in a world of 12% inflation a business earning\n20% on equity (which very few manage consistently to do) and\ndistributing it all to individuals in the 50% bracket is chewing\nup their real capital, not enhancing it. (Half of the 20% will go\nfor income tax; the remaining 10% leaves the owners of the\nbusiness with only 98% of the purchasing power they possessed at\nthe start of the year - even though they have not spent a penny\nof their earnings). The investors in this bracket would\nactually be better off with a combination of stable prices and\ncorporate earnings on equity capital of only a few per cent.\n\nExplicit income taxes alone, unaccompanied by any implicit\ninflation tax, never can turn a positive corporate return into a\nnegative owner return. (Even if there were 90% personal income\ntax rates on both dividends and capital gains, some real income\nwould be left for the owner at a zero inflation rate.) But the\ninflation tax is not limited by reported income. Inflation rates\nnot far from those recently experienced can turn the level of\npositive returns achieved by a majority of corporations into\nnegative returns for all owners, including those not required to\npay explicit taxes. (For example, if inflation reached 16%,\nowners of the 60% plus of corporate America earning less than\nthis rate of return would be realizing a negative real return -\neven if income taxes on dividends and capital gains were\neliminated.)\n\nOf course, the two forms of taxation co-exist and interact\nsince explicit taxes are levied on nominal, not real, income.\nThus you pay income taxes on what would be deficits if returns to\nstockholders were measured in constant dollars.",

(Well say it again next year, too.) Inflation does\nnot improve our return on equity.\n\nIndexing is the insulation that all seek against inflation.\nBut the great bulk (although there are important exceptions) of\ncorporate capital is not even partially indexed. Of course,\nearnings and dividends per share usually will rise if significant\nearnings are saved by a corporation; i. e., reinvested instead\nof paid as dividends. But that would be true without inflation.\nA thrifty wage earner, likewise, could achieve regular annual\nincreases in his total income without ever getting a pay increase\n-\nif\nhe were willing to take only half of his paycheck in cash\n(his wage dividend) and consistently add the other half (his\nretained earnings) to a savings account. Neither this highsaving wage earner nor the stockholder in a high-saving\ncorporation whose annual dividend rate increases while its rate\nof return on equity remains flat is truly indexed.\n\nFor capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise,\ni. e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion\nto the increase in the price level\nwithout any need for the\nbusiness to add to capital - including working capital -\nemployed.\n(Increased earnings produced by increased investment\ndont count.) Only a few businesses come close to exhibiting this\nability. And Berkshire Hathaway isnt one of them.\n\nWe, of course, have a corporate policy of reinvesting\nearnings for growth, diversity and strength, which has the\nincidental effect of minimizing the current imposition of\nexplicit taxes on our owners. However, on a day-by-day basis,\nyou will be subjected to the implicit inflation tax, and when you\nwish to transfer your investment in Berkshire into another form\nof investment, or into consumption, you also will face explicit\ntaxes.",

Thus, we have a much larger economic\ninterest in the aluminum business than in practically any of the\noperating businesses we control and on which we report in more\ndetail.

    "content": "Our largest non-controlled holding is 7.2 million shares of\nGEICO Corp., equal to about a 33% equity interest. Normally, an\ninterest of this magnitude (over 20%) would qualify as an\ninvestee holding and would require us to reflect a\nproportionate share of GEICOs earnings in our own. However, we\npurchased our GEICO stock pursuant to special orders of the\nDistrict of Columbia and New York Insurance Departments, which\nrequired that the right to vote the stock be placed with an\nindependent party. Absent the vote, our 33% interest does not\nqualify for investee treatment. (Pinkertons is a similar\nsituation.)\n\nOf course, whether or not the undistributed earnings of\nGEICO are picked up annually in our operating earnings figure has\nnothing to do with their economic value to us, or to you as\nowners of Berkshire. The value of these retained earnings will\nbe determined by the skill with which they are put to use by\nGEICO management.\n\nOn this score, we simply couldnt feel better. GEICO\nrepresents the best of all investment worlds - the coupling of a\nvery important and very hard to duplicate business advantage with\nan extraordinary management whose skills in operations are\nmatched by skills in capital allocation.\n\nAs you can see, our holdings cost us $47 million, with about\nhalf of this amount invested in 1976 and most of the remainder\ninvested in 1980. At the present dividend rate, our reported\nearnings from GEICO amount to a little over $3 million annually.\nBut we estimate our share of its earning power is on the order of\n$20 million annually. Thus, undistributed earnings applicable to\nthis holding alone may amount to 40% of total reported operating\nearnings of Berkshire.\n\nWe should emphasize that we feel as comfortable with GEICO\nmanagement retaining an estimated $17 million of earnings\napplicable to our ownership as we would if that sum were in our\nown hands. In just the last two years GEICO, through repurchases\nof its own stock, has reduced the share equivalents it has\noutstanding from 34.2 million to 21.6 million, dramatically\nenhancing the interests of shareholders in a business that simply\ncant be replicated. The owners could not have been better\nserved.\n\nWe have written in past reports about the disappointments\nthat usually result from purchase and operation of turnaround\nbusinesses. Literally hundreds of turnaround possibilities in\ndozens of industries have been described to us over the years\nand, either as participants or as observers, we have tracked\nperformance against expectations. Our conclusion is that, with\nfew exceptions, when a management with a reputation for\nbrilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor\nfundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that\nremains intact.\n\nGEICO may appear to be an exception, having been turned\naround from the very edge of bankruptcy in 1976. It certainly is\ntrue that managerial brilliance was needed for its resuscitation,\nand that Jack Byrne, upon arrival in that year, supplied that\ningredient in abundance.",

    "content": "But it also is true that the fundamental business advantage\nthat GEICO had enjoyed - an advantage that previously had\nproduced staggering success - was still intact within the\ncompany, although submerged in a sea of financial and operating\ntroubles.\n\nGEICO was designed to be the low-cost operation in an\nenormous marketplace (auto insurance) populated largely by\ncompanies whose marketing structures restricted adaptation. Run\nas designed, it could offer unusual value to its customers while\nearning unusual returns for itself. For decades it had been run\nin just this manner. Its troubles in the mid-70 s were not\nproduced by any diminution or disappearance of this essential\neconomic advantage.\n\nGEICOs problems at that time put it in a position analogous\nto that of American Express in 1964 following the salad oil\nscandal. Both were one-of-a-kind companies, temporarily reeling\nfrom the effects of a fiscal blow that did not destroy their\nexceptional underlying economics. The GEICO and American Express\nsituations, extraordinary business franchises with a localized\nexcisable cancer (needing, to be sure, a skilled surgeon), should\nbe distinguished from the true turnaround situation in which\nthe managers expect - and need - to pull off a corporate\nPygmalion.\n\nWhatever the appellation, we are delighted with our GEICO\nholding which, as noted, cost us $47 million. To buy a similar\n$20 million of earning power in a business with first-class\neconomic characteristics and bright prospects would cost a\nminimum of $200 million (much more in some industries) if it had\nto be accomplished through negotiated purchase of an entire\ncompany. A 100% interest of that kind gives the owner the\noptions of leveraging the purchase, changing managements,\ndirecting cash flow, and selling the business. It may also\nprovide some excitement around corporate headquarters (less\nfrequently mentioned).\n\nWe find it perfectly satisfying that the nature of our\ninsurance business dictates we buy many minority portions of\nalready well-run businesses (at prices far below our share of the\ntotal value of the entire business) that do not need management\nchange, re-direction of cash flow, or sale. There arent many\nJack Byrnes in the managerial world, or GEICOs in the business\nworld. What could be better than buying into a partnership with\nboth of them?",

    "content": "The insurance industrys underwriting picture continues to\nunfold about as we anticipated, with the combined ratio (see\ndefinition on page 37) rising from 100.6 in 1979 to an estimated\n103.5 in 1980. It is virtually certain that this trend will\ncontinue and that industry underwriting losses will mount,\nsignificantly and progressively, in 1981 and 1982. To understand\nwhy, we recommend that you read the excellent analysis of\nproperty-casualty competitive dynamics done by Barbara Stewart of\nChubb Corp. in an October 1980 paper. (Chubbs annual report\nconsistently presents the most insightful, candid and wellwritten discussion of industry conditions; you should get on the\ncompanys mailing list.) Mrs. Stewarts analysis may not be\ncheerful, but we think it is very likely to be accurate.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, a largely unreported but particularly\npernicious problem may well prolong and intensify the coming\nindustry agony. It is not only likely to keep many insurers\nscrambling for business when underwriting losses hit record\nlevels - it is likely to cause them at such a time to redouble\ntheir efforts.\n\nThis problem arises from the decline in bond prices and the\ninsurance accounting convention that allows companies to carry\nbonds at amortized cost, regardless of market value. Many\ninsurers own long-term bonds that, at amortized cost, amount to\ntwo to three times net worth. If the level is three times, of\ncourse, a one-third shrink from cost in bond prices - if it were\nto be recognized on the books - would wipe out net worth. And\nshrink they have. Some of the largest and best known propertycasualty companies currently find themselves with nominal, or\neven negative, net worth when bond holdings are valued at market.\nOf course their bonds could rise in price, thereby partially, or\nconceivably even fully, restoring the integrity of stated net\nworth. Or they could fall further. (We believe that short-term\nforecasts of stock or bond prices are useless. The forecasts may\ntell you a great deal about the forecaster; they tell you nothing\nabout the future.)\n\nIt might strike some as strange that an insurance companys\nsurvival is threatened when its stock portfolio falls\nsufficiently in price to reduce net worth significantly, but that\nan even greater decline in bond prices produces no reaction at\nall. The industry would respond by pointing out that, no matter\nwhat the current price, the bonds will be paid in full at\nmaturity, thereby eventually eliminating any interim price\ndecline. It may take twenty, thirty, or even forty years, this\nargument says, but, as long as the bonds dont have to be sold,\nin the end theyll all be worth face value. Of course, if they\nare sold even if they are replaced with similar bonds offering\nbetter relative value - the loss must be booked immediately.\nAnd, just as promptly, published net worth must be adjusted\ndownward by the amount of the loss.",

    "content": "Under such circumstances, a great many investment options\ndisappear, perhaps for decades. For example, when large\nunderwriting losses are in prospect, it may make excellent\nbusiness logic for some insurers to shift from tax-exempt bonds\ninto taxable bonds. Unwillingness to recognize major bond losses\nmay be the sole factor that prevents such a sensible move.\n\nBut the full implications flowing from massive unrealized\nbond losses are far more serious than just the immobilization of\ninvestment intellect. For the source of funds to purchase\nand\nhold\nthose bonds is a pool of money derived from policyholders\nand claimants (with changing faces) - money which, in effect, is\ntemporarily on deposit with the insurer. As long as this pool\nretains its size, no bonds must be sold. If the pool of funds\nshrinks - which it will if the volume of business declines\nsignificantly - assets must be sold to pay off the liabilities.\nAnd if those assets consist of bonds with big unrealized losses,\nsuch losses will rapidly become realized, decimating net worth in\nthe process.\n\nThus, an insurance company with a bond market value\nshrinkage approaching stated net worth (of which there are now\nmany) and also faced with inadequate rate levels that are sure to\ndeteriorate further has two options. One option for management\nis to tell the underwriters to keep pricing according to the\nexposure involved - be sure to get a dollar of premium for every\ndollar of expense cost plus expectable loss cost.\n\nThe consequences of this directive are predictable: (a) with\nmost business both price sensitive and renewable annually, many\npolicies presently on the books will be lost to competitors in\nrather short order; (b) as premium volume shrinks significantly,\nthere will be a lagged but corresponding decrease in liabilities\n(unearned premiums and claims payable); (c) assets (bonds) must\nbe sold to match the decrease in liabilities; and (d) the\nformerly unrecognized disappearance of net worth will become\npartially recognized (depending upon the extent of such sales) in\nthe insurers published financial statements.\n\nVariations of this depressing sequence involve a smaller\npenalty to stated net worth. The reaction of some companies at\n(c) would be to sell either stocks that are already carried at\nmarket values or recently purchased bonds involving less severe\nlosses. This ostrich-like behavior - selling the better assets\nand keeping the biggest losers - while less painful in the short\nterm, is unlikely to be a winner in the long term.\n\nThe second option is much simpler: just keep writing\nbusiness regardless of rate levels and whopping prospective\nunderwriting losses, thereby maintaining the present levels of\npremiums, assets and liabilities - and then pray for a better\nday, either for underwriting or for bond prices. There is much\ncriticism in the trade press of cash flow underwriting; i. e.,\nwriting business regardless of prospective underwriting losses in\norder to obtain funds to invest at current high interest rates.\nThis second option might properly be termed asset maintenance\nunderwriting - the acceptance of terrible business just to keep\nthe assets you now have.",

And it\nalso is clear that as long as many large insurers feel compelled\nto choose that second option, there will be no better day for\nunderwriting. For if much of the industry feels it must maintain\npremium volume levels regardless of price adequacy, all insurers\nwill have to come close to meeting those prices. Right behind\nhaving financial problems yourself, the next worst plight is to\nhave a large group of competitors with financial problems that\nthey can defer by a sell-at-any-price policy.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that companies that were unwilling -\nfor any of a number of reasons, including public reaction,\ninstitutional pride, or protection of stated net worth - to sell\nbonds at price levels forcing recognition of major losses might\nfind themselves frozen in investment posture for a decade or\nlonger. But, as noted, thats only half of the problem.\n\nCompanies that have made extensive commitments to long-term bonds\nmay have lost, for a considerable period of time, not only many\nof their investment options, but many of their underwriting\noptions as well.\n\nOur own position in this respect is satisfactory. We\nbelieve our net worth, valuing bonds of all insurers at amortized\ncost, is the strongest relative to premium volume among all large\nproperty-casualty stockholder-owned groups. When bonds are\nvalued at market, our relative strength becomes far more\ndramatic. (But lest we get too puffed up, we remind ourselves\nthat our asset and liability maturities still are far more\nmismatched than we would wish and that we, too, lost important\nsums in bonds because your Chairman was talking when he should\nhave been acting.)\n\nOur abundant capital and investment flexibility will enable\nus to do whatever we think makes the most sense during the\nprospective extended period of inadequate pricing. But troubles\nfor the industry mean troubles for us. Our financial strength\ndoesnt remove us from the hostile pricing environment now\nenveloping the entire property-casualty insurance industry. It\njust gives us more staying power and more options.",

While volume was flat, underwriting margins\nrelative to the industry were at an all-time high. We expect\ndecreased volume from this operation in 1981. But its managers\nwill hear no complaints from corporate headquarters, nor will\nemployment or salaries suffer. We enormously admire the National\nIndemnity underwriting discipline - embedded from origin by the\nfounder, Jack Ringwalt - and know that this discipline, if\nsuspended, probably could not be fully regained.\n\nJohn Seward at Home and Auto continues to make good progress\nin replacing a diminishing number of auto policies with volume\nfrom less competitive lines, primarily small-premium general\nliability. Operations are being slowly expanded, both\ngeographically and by product line, as warranted by underwriting\nresults.\n\nThe reinsurance business continues to reflect the excesses\nand problems of the primary writers. Worse yet, it has the\npotential for magnifying such excesses. Reinsurance is\ncharacterized by extreme ease of entry, large premium payments in\nadvance, and much-delayed loss reports and loss payments.\nInitially, the morning mail brings lots of cash and few claims.\nThis state of affairs can produce a blissful, almost euphoric,\nfeeling akin to that experienced by an innocent upon receipt of\nhis first credit card.\n\nThe magnetic lure of such cash-generating characteristics,\ncurrently enhanced by the presence of high interest rates, is\ntransforming the reinsurance market into amateur night.\nWithout a super catastrophe, industry underwriting will be poor\nin the next few years.

We\nwill retain an active reinsurance presence but, for the\nforeseeable future, we expect no premium growth from this\nactivity.\n\nWe continue to have serious problems in the Homestate\noperation. Floyd Taylor in Kansas has done an outstanding job\nbut our underwriting record elsewhere is considerably below\naverage. Our poorest performer has been Insurance Company of\nIowa, at which large losses have been sustained annually since\nits founding in 1973. Late in the fall we abandoned underwriting\nin that state, and have merged the company into Cornhusker\nCasualty. There is potential in the homestate concept, but much\nwork needs to be done in order to realize it.\n\nOur Workers Compensation operation suffered a severe loss\nwhen Frank De Nardo died last year at 37. Frank instinctively\nthought like an underwriter. He was a superb technician and a\nfierce competitor; in short order he had straightened out major\nproblems at the California Workers Compensation Division of\nNational Indemnity. Dan Grossman, who originally brought Frank\nto us, stepped in immediately after Franks death to continue\nthat operation, which now utilizes Redwood Fire and Casualty,\nanother Berkshire subsidiary, as the insuring vehicle.\n\nOur major Workers Compensation operation, Cypress Insurance\nCompany, run by Milt Thornton, continues its outstanding record.\nYear after year Milt, like Phil Liesche, runs an underwriting\noperation that far outpaces his competition. In the industry he\nis admired and copied, but not matched.\n\nOverall, we look for a significant decline in insurance\nvolume in 1981 along with a poorer underwriting result. We\nexpect underwriting experience somewhat superior to that of the\nindustry but, of course, so does most of the industry. There\nwill be some disappointments.",

    "content": "Disposition of Illinois National Bank and Trust of Rockford\n\nOn December 31,1980 we completed the exchange of 41,086\nshares of Rockford Bancorp Inc. (which owns 97.7% of Illinois\nNational Bank) for a like number of shares of Berkshire Hathaway\nInc.\n\nOur method of exchange allowed all Berkshire shareholders to\nmaintain their proportional interest in the Bank (except for me;\nI was permitted 80% of my proportional share). They were thus\nguaranteed an ownership position identical to that they would\nhave attained had we followed a more conventional spinoff\napproach. Twenty-four shareholders (of our approximate 1300)\nchose this proportional exchange option.\n\nWe also allowed overexchanges, and thirty-nine additional\nshareholders accepted this option, thereby increasing their\nownership in the Bank and decreasing their proportional ownership\nin Berkshire. All got the full amount of Bancorp stock they\nrequested, since the total shares desired by these thirty-nine\nholders was just slightly less than the number left available by\nthe remaining 1200-plus holders of Berkshire who elected not to\npart with any Berkshire shares at all. As the exchanger of last\nresort, I took the small balance (3% of Bancorps stock). These\nshares, added to shares I received from my basic exchange\nallotment (80% of normal), gave me a slightly reduced\nproportional interest in the Bank and a slightly enlarged\nproportional interest in Berkshire.\n\nManagement of the Bank is pleased with the outcome. Bancorp\nwill operate as an inexpensive and uncomplicated holding company\nowned by 65 shareholders. And all of those shareholders will\nhave become Bancorp owners through a conscious affirmative\ndecision.\n\nFinancing\n\nIn August we sold $60 million of 12 3/4% notes due August 1,2005, with a sinking fund to begin in 1991.\n\nThe managing underwriters, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette\nSecurities Corporation, represented by Bill Fisher, and Chiles,\nHeider & Company, Inc., represented by Charlie Heider, did an\nabsolutely first-class job from start to finish of the financing.\n\nUnlike most businesses, Berkshire did not finance because of\nany specific immediate needs. Rather, we borrowed because we\nthink that, over a period far shorter than the life of the loan,\nwe will have many opportunities to put the money to good use.\nThe most attractive opportunities may present themselves at a\ntime when credit is extremely expensive - or even unavailable.\nAt such a time we want to have plenty of financial firepower.\n\nOur acquisition preferences run toward businesses that\ngenerate cash, not those that consume it. As inflation\nintensifies, more and more companies find that they must spend\nall funds they generate internally just to maintain their\nexisting physical volume of business. There is a certain miragelike quality to such operations. However attractive the earnings\nnumbers, we remain leery of businesses that never seem able to\nconvert such pretty numbers into no-strings-attached cash.\n\nBusinesses meeting our standards are not easy to find. (Each\nyear we read of hundreds of corporate acquisitions; only a\nhandful would have been of interest to us.) And logical expansion\nof our present operations is not easy to implement. But well\ncontinue to utilize both avenues in our attempts to further\nBerkshires growth.\n\nUnder all circumstances we plan to operate with plenty of\nliquidity, with debt that is moderate in size and properly\nstructured, and with an abundance of capital strength. Our\nreturn on equity is penalized somewhat by this conservative\napproach, but it is the only one with which we feel comfortable.",

As a friend, banker and\ncitizen, he was unsurpassed.\n\nYou learn a great deal about a person when you purchase a\nbusiness from him and he then stays on to run it as an employee\nrather than as an owner. Before the purchase the seller knows\nthe business intimately, whereas you start from scratch. The\nseller has dozens of opportunities to mislead the buyer - through\nomissions, ambiguities, and misdirection. After the check has\nchanged hands, subtle (and not so subtle) changes of attitude can\noccur and implicit understandings can evaporate. As in the\ncourtship-marriage sequence, disappointments are not infrequent.\n\nFrom the time we first met, Gene shot straight 100% of the\ntime - the only behavior pattern he had within him. At the\noutset of negotiations, he laid all negative factors face up on\nthe table; on the other hand, for years after the transaction was\ncompleted he would tell me periodically of some previously\nundiscussed items of value that had come with our purchase.\n\nThough he was already 71 years of age when he sold us the\nBank, Gene subsequently worked harder for us than he had for\nhimself. He never delayed reporting a problem for a minute, but\nproblems were few with Gene. What else would you expect from a\nman who, at the time of the bank holiday in 1933, had enough cash\non the premises to pay all depositors in full? Gene never forgot\nhe was handling other peoples money. Though this fiduciary\nattitude was always dominant, his superb managerial skills\nenabled the Bank to regularly achieve the top position nationally\nin profitability.\n\nGene was in charge of the Illinois National for close to\nfifty years - almost one-quarter of the lifetime of our country.\nGeorge Mead, a wealthy industrialist, brought him in from Chicago\nto open a new bank after a number of other banks in Rockford had\nfailed. Mr. Mead put up the money and Gene ran the show. His\ntalent for leadership soon put its stamp on virtually every major\ncivic activity in Rockford.\n\nDozens of Rockford citizens have told me over the years of\nhelp Gene extended to them. In some cases this help was\nfinancial; in all cases it involved much wisdom, empathy and\nfriendship. He always offered the same to me. Because of our\nrespective ages and positions I was sometimes the junior partner,\nsometimes the senior. Whichever the relationship, it always was\na special one, and I miss it.\n\nWarren E.

All\nnumbers represent Berkshires net interest in the larger\ngross holdings of the group.\n\nFrom this table, you can see that our sources of underlying\nearning power are distributed far differently among industries\nthan would superficially seem the case. For example, our\ninsurance subsidiaries own approximately 3% of Kaiser Aluminum,\nand 1 1/4% of Alcoa. Our share of the 1980 earnings of those\ncompanies amounts to about $13 million. (If translated dollar for\ndollar into a combination of eventual market value gain and\ndividends, this figure would have to be reduced by a significant,\nbut not precisely determinable, amount of tax; perhaps 25% would\nbe a fair assumption.) Thus, we have a much larger economic\ninterest in the aluminum business than in practically any of the\noperating businesses we control and on which we report in more\ndetail. If we maintain our holdings, our long-term performance\nwill be more affected by the future economics of the aluminum\nindustry than it will by direct operating decisions we make\nconcerning most companies over which we exercise managerial\ncontrol.",
