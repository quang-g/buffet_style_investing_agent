    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur per-share book value increased 20.3% during 1992. Over\nthe last 28 years (that is, since present management took over)\nbook value has grown from $19 to $7,745, or at a rate of 23.6%\ncompounded annually.\n\nDuring the year, Berkshire's net worth increased by $1.52\nbillion. More than 98% of this gain came from earnings and\nappreciation of portfolio securities, with the remainder coming\nfrom the issuance of new stock. These shares were issued as a\nresult of our calling our convertible debentures for redemption\non January 4,1993, and of some holders electing to receive\ncommon shares rather than the cash that was their alternative.\nMost holders of the debentures who converted into common waited\nuntil January to do it, but a few made the move in December and\ntherefore received shares in 1992. To sum up what happened to\nthe $476 million of bonds we had outstanding: $25 million were\nconverted into shares before yearend; $46 million were converted\nin January; and $405 million were redeemed for cash. The\nconversions were made at $11,719 per share, so altogether we\nissued 6,106 shares.\n\nBerkshire now has 1,152,547 shares outstanding. That\ncompares, you will be interested to know, to 1,137,778 shares\noutstanding on October 1,1964, the beginning of the fiscal year\nduring which Buffett Partnership, Ltd. acquired control of the\ncompany.\n\nWe have a firm policy about issuing shares of Berkshire,\ndoing so only when we receive as much value as we give. Equal\nvalue, however, has not been easy to obtain, since we have always\nvalued our shares highly. So be it: We wish to increase\nBerkshire's size only when doing that also increases the wealth\nof its owners.\n\nThose two objectives do not necessarily go hand-in-hand as an\namusing but value-destroying experience in our past illustrates.\nOn that occasion, we had a significant investment in a bank\nwhose management was hell-bent on expansion. (Aren't they all?)\nWhen our bank wooed a smaller bank, its owner demanded a stock\nswap on a basis that valued the acquiree's net worth and earning\npower at over twice that of the acquirer's. Our management -\nvisibly in heat - quickly capitulated. The owner of the acquiree\nthen insisted on one other condition: \"You must promise me,\" he\nsaid in effect, \"that once our merger is done and I have become a\nmajor shareholder, you'll never again make a deal this dumb.\"\n\nYou will remember that our goal is to increase our per-share\nintrinsic value - for which our book value is a conservative, but\nuseful, proxy - at a 15% annual rate. This objective, however,\ncannot be attained in a smooth manner. Smoothness is\nparticularly elusive because of the accounting rules that apply\nto the common stocks owned by our insurance companies, whose\nportfolios represent a high proportion of Berkshire's net worth.\nSince 1979, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have\nrequired that these securities be valued at their market prices\n(less an adjustment for tax on any net unrealized appreciation)\nrather than at the lower of cost or market. Run-of-the-mill\nfluctuations in equity prices therefore cause our annual results\nto gyrate, especially in comparison to those of the typical\nindustrial company.\n\nTo illustrate just how volatile our progress has been - and\nto indicate the impact that market movements have on short-term\nresults - we show on the facing page our annual change in pershare net worth and compare it with the annual results (including\ndividends) of the S&P 500.",

    "content": "You should keep at least three points in mind as you\nevaluate this data. The first point concerns the many businesses\nwe operate whose annual earnings are unaffected by changes in\nstock market valuations. The impact of these businesses on both\nour absolute and relative performance has changed over the years.\nEarly on, returns from our textile operation, which then\nrepresented a significant portion of our net worth, were a major\ndrag on performance, averaging far less than would have been the\ncase if the money invested in that business had instead been\ninvested in the S&P 500. In more recent years, as we assembled\nour collection of exceptional businesses run by equally\nexceptional managers, the returns from our operating businesses\nhave been high - usually well in excess of the returns achieved\nby the S&P.\n\nA second important factor to consider - and one that\nsignificantly hurts our relative performance - is that both the\nincome and capital gains from our securities are burdened by a\nsubstantial corporate tax liability whereas the S&P returns are\npre-tax. To comprehend the damage, imagine that Berkshire had\nowned nothing other than the S&P index during the 28-year period\ncovered. In that case, the tax bite would have caused our\ncorporate performance to be appreciably below the record shown in\nthe table for the S&P. Under present tax laws, a gain for the\nS&P of 18% delivers a corporate holder of that index a return\nwell short of 13%. And this problem would be intensified if\ncorporate tax rates were to rise. This is a structural\ndisadvantage we simply have to live with; there is no antidote\nfor it.\n\nThe third point incorporates two predictions: Charlie\nMunger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I are\nvirtually certain that the return over the next decade from an\ninvestment in the S&P index will be far less than that of the\npast decade, and we are dead certain that the drag exerted by\nBerkshire's expanding capital base will substantially reduce our\nhistorical advantage relative to the index.\n\nMaking the first prediction goes somewhat against our grain:\nWe've long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to\nmake fortune tellers look good. Even now, Charlie and I continue\nto believe that short-term market forecasts are poison and should\nbe kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also\nfrom grown-ups who behave in the market like children. However,\nit is clear that stocks cannot forever overperform their\nunderlying businesses, as they have so dramatically done for some\ntime, and that fact makes us quite confident of our forecast that\nthe rewards from investing in stocks over the next decade will be\nsignificantly smaller than they were in the last. Our second\nconclusion - that an increased capital base will act as an anchor\non our relative performance - seems incontestable. The only open\nquestion is whether we can drag the anchor along at some\ntolerable, though slowed, pace.\n\nWe will continue to experience considerable volatility in\nour annual results. That's assured by the general volatility of\nthe stock market, by the concentration of our equity holdings in\njust a few companies, and by certain business decisions we have\nmade, most especially our move to commit large resources to\nsuper-catastrophe insurance. We not only accept this volatility\nbut welcome it: A tolerance for short-term swings improves our\nlong-term prospects. In baseball lingo, our performance\nyardstick is slugging percentage, not batting average.",

You can tell from Berkshire's 199192 results that the company didn't miss me while I was gone. But\nthe reverse isn't true: I missed Berkshire and am delighted to\nbe back full-time. There is no job in the world that is more fun\nthan running Berkshire and I count myself lucky to be where I am.\n\nThe Salomon post, though far from fun, was interesting and\nworthwhile: In Fortune's annual survey of America's Most Admired\nCorporations, conducted last September, Salomon ranked second\namong 311 companies in the degree to which it improved its\nreputation. Additionally, Salomon Brothers, the securities\nsubsidiary of Salomon Inc, reported record pre-tax earnings last\nyear - 34% above the previous high.\n\nMany people helped in the resolution of Salomon's problems\nand the righting of the firm, but a few clearly deserve special\nmention. It is no exaggeration to say that without the combined\nefforts of Salomon executives Deryck Maughan, Bob Denham, Don\nHoward, and John Macfarlane, the firm very probably would not\nhave survived. In their work, these men were tireless,\neffective, supportive and selfless, and I will forever be\ngrateful to them.\n\nSalomon's lead lawyer in its Government matters, Ron Olson\nof Munger, Tolles & Olson, was also key to our success in getting\nthrough this trouble. The firm's problems were not only severe,\nbut complex. At least five authorities - the SEC, the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, the U. S. Treasury, the U. S. Attorney\nfor the Southern District of New York, and the Antitrust Division\nof the Department of Justice - had important concerns about\nSalomon.

    "content": "Acquisitions\n\nOf all our activities at Berkshire, the most exhilarating\nfor Charlie and me is the acquisition of a business with\nexcellent economic characteristics and a management that we like,\ntrust and admire. Such acquisitions are not easy to make but we\nlook for them constantly. In the search, we adopt the same\nattitude one might find appropriate in looking for a spouse: It\npays to be active, interested and open-minded, but it does not\npay to be in a hurry.\n\nIn the past, I've observed that many acquisition-hungry\nmanagers were apparently mesmerized by their childhood reading of\nthe story about the frog-kissing princess. Remembering her\nsuccess, they pay dearly for the right to kiss corporate toads,\nexpecting wondrous transfigurations. Initially, disappointing\nresults only deepen their desire to round up new toads.\n(\"Fanaticism,\" said Santyana, \"consists of redoubling your effort\nwhen you've forgotten your aim.\") Ultimately, even the most\noptimistic manager must face reality. Standing knee-deep in\nunresponsive toads, he then announces an enormous \"restructuring\"\ncharge. In this corporate equivalent of a Head Start program,\nthe CEO receives the education but the stockholders pay the\ntuition.\n\nIn my early days as a manager I, too, dated a few toads.\nThey were cheap dates - I've never been much of a sport - but my\nresults matched those of acquirers who courted higher-priced\ntoads. I kissed and they croaked.\n\nAfter several failures of this type, I finally remembered\nsome useful advice I once got from a golf pro (who, like all pros\nwho have had anything to do with my game, wishes to remain\nanonymous). Said the pro: \"Practice doesn't make perfect;\npractice makes permanent.\" And thereafter I revised my strategy\nand tried to buy good businesses at fair prices rather than fair\nbusinesses at good prices.\n\nLast year, in December, we made an acquisition that is a\nprototype of what we now look for. The purchase was 82% of\nCentral States Indemnity, an insurer that makes monthly payments\nfor credit-card holders who are unable themselves to pay because\nthey have become disabled or unemployed. Currently the company's\nannual premiums are about $90 million and profits about $10\nmillion. Central States is based in Omaha and managed by Bill\nKizer, a friend of mine for over 35 years. The Kizer family -\nwhich includes sons Bill, Dick and John - retains 18% ownership\nof the business and will continue to run things just as it has in\nthe past. We could not be associated with better people.\n\nCoincidentally, this latest acquisition has much in common\nwith our first, made 26 years ago. At that time, we purchased\nanother Omaha insurer, National Indemnity Company (along with a\nsmall sister company) from Jack Ringwalt, another long-time\nfriend. Jack had built the business from scratch and, as was the\ncase with Bill Kizer, thought of me when he wished to sell.\n(Jack's comment at the time: \"If I don't sell the company, my\nexecutor will, and I'd rather pick the home for it.\") National\nIndemnity was an outstanding business when we bought it and\ncontinued to be under Jack's management. Hollywood has had good\nluck with sequels; I believe we, too, will.",

In this presentation, amortization of\nGoodwill and other major purchase-price accounting adjustments\nare not charged against the specific businesses to which they\napply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately. This\nprocedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they\nwould have been reported had we not purchased them. I've\nexplained in past reports why this form of presentation seems to\nus to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing\nGAAP, which requires purchase-price adjustments to be made on a\nbusiness-by-business basis. The total net earnings we show in\nthe table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our\naudited financial statements.\n\nA large amount of additional information about these\nbusinesses is given on pages 37-47, where you will also find our\nsegment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. Our goal is to give you\nall of the financial information that Charlie and I consider\nsignificant in making our own evaluation of Berkshire.",

    "content": "\"Look-Through\" Earnings\n\nWe've previously discussed look-through earnings, which\nconsist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\nsection, plus; (2) the retained operating earnings of major\ninvestees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our\nprofits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by\nBerkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead been\ndistributed to us. Though no single figure can be perfect, we\nbelieve that the look-through number more accurately portrays the\nearnings of Berkshire than does the GAAP number.\n\nI've told you that over time look-through earnings must\nincrease at about 15% annually if our intrinsic business value is\nto grow at that rate. Our look-through earnings in 1992 were $604\nmillion, and they will need to grow to more than $1.8 billion by\nthe year 2000 if we are to meet that 15% goal. For us to get\nthere, our operating subsidiaries and investees must deliver\nexcellent performances, and we must exercise some skill in capital\nallocation as well.\n\nWe cannot promise to achieve the $1.8 billion target. Indeed,\nwe may not even come close to it. But it does guide our decisionmaking: When we allocate capital today, we are thinking about what\nwill maximize look-through earnings in 2000.\n\nWe do not, however, see this long-term focus as eliminating\nthe need for us to achieve decent short-term results as well.\nAfter all, we were thinking long-range thoughts five or ten years\nago, and the moves we made then should now be paying off. If\nplantings made confidently are repeatedly followed by disappointing\nharvests, something is wrong with the farmer. (Or perhaps with the\nfarm: Investors should understand that for certain companies, and\neven for some industries, there simply is\nno\ngood long-term\nstrategy.) Just as you should be suspicious of managers who pump\nup short-term earnings by accounting maneuvers, asset sales and the\nlike, so also should you be suspicious of those managers who fail\nto deliver for extended periods and blame it on their long-term\nfocus. (Even Alice, after listening to the Queen lecture her about\n\"jam tomorrow,\" finally insisted, \"It must come sometimes to jam\ntoday.\")\n\nThe following table shows you how we calculate look-through\nearnings, though I warn you that the figures are necessarily\nvery\n\nrough. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been\nincluded in the operating earnings itemized on page 8, mostly\nunder \"Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.\")",

    "content": "Insurance Operations\n\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table\npresenting key figures for the property-casualty insurance\nindustry:\n\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: A\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss. The higher the ratio, the worse the year.\nWhen the investment income that an insurer earns from holding\npolicyholders' funds (\"the float\") is taken into account, a\ncombined ratio in the 106 - 110 range typically produces an\noverall break-even result, exclusive of earnings on the funds\nprovided by shareholders.\n\nAbout four points in the industry's 1992 combined ratio can\nbe attributed to Hurricane Andrew, which caused the largest\ninsured loss in history. Andrew destroyed a few small insurers.\nBeyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that\ntheir reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from\nadequate. (It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's\nbeen swimming naked.) One major insurer escaped insolvency\nsolely because it had a wealthy parent that could promptly supply\na massive transfusion of capital.\n\nBad as it was, however, Andrew could easily have been far\nmore damaging if it had hit Florida 20 or 30 miles north of where\nit actually did and had hit Louisiana further east than was the\ncase. All in all, many companies will rethink their reinsurance\nprograms in light of the Andrew experience.\n\nAs you know we are a large writer - perhaps the largest in\nthe world - of \"super-cat\" coverages, which are the policies that\nother insurance companies buy to protect themselves against major\ncatastrophic losses. Consequently, we too took our lumps from\nAndrew, suffering losses from it of about $125 million, an amount\nroughly equal to our 1992 super-cat premium income. Our other\nsuper-cat losses, though, were negligible. This line of business\ntherefore produced an overall loss of only $2 million for the\nyear. (In addition, our investee, GEICO, suffered a net loss\nfrom Andrew, after reinsurance recoveries and tax savings, of\nabout $50 million, of which our share is roughly $25 million.\nThis loss did not affect our operating earnings, but did reduce\nour look-through earnings.)\n\nIn last year's report I told you that I hoped that our\nsuper-cat business would over time achieve a 10% profit margin.\nBut I also warned you that in any given year the line was likely\nto be \"either enormously profitable or enormously unprofitable.\"\nInstead, both 1991 and 1992 have come in close to a break-even\nlevel. Nonetheless, I see these results as aberrations and stick\nwith my prediction of huge annual swings in profitability from\nthis business.\n\nLet me remind you of some characteristics of our super-cat\npolicies. Generally, they are activated only when two things\nhappen. First, the direct insurer or reinsurer we protect must\nsuffer losses of a given amount - that's the policyholder's\n\"retention\" - from a catastrophe; and second, industry-wide\ninsured losses from the catastrophe must exceed some minimum\nlevel, which usually is $3 billion or more. In most cases, the\npolicies we issue cover only a specific geographical area, such\nas a portion of the U. S., the entire U. S., or everywhere other\nthan the U. S. Also, many policies are not activated by the first\nsuper-cat that meets the policy terms, but instead cover only a\n\"second-event\" or even a third- or fourth-event. Finally, some\npolicies are triggered only by a catastrophe of a specific type,\nsuch as an earthquake. Our exposures are large: We have one\npolicy that calls for us to pay $100 million to the policyholder\nif a specified catastrophe occurs. (Now you know why I suffer\neyestrain: from watching The Weather Channel.)",

    "content": "Currently, Berkshire is second in the U. S. property-casualty\nindustry in net worth (the leader being State Farm, which neither\nbuys nor sells reinsurance). Therefore, we have the capacity to\nassume risk on a scale that interests virtually no other company.\nWe have the appetite as well: As Berkshire's net worth and\nearnings grow, our willingness to write business increases also.\nBut let me add that means good business. The saying, \"a fool\nand his money are soon invited everywhere,\" applies in spades in\nreinsurance, and we actually reject more than 98% of the business\nwe are offered. Our ability to choose between good and bad\nproposals reflects a management strength that matches our\nfinancial strength: Ajit Jain, who runs our reinsurance\noperation, is simply the best in this business. In combination,\nthese strengths guarantee that we will stay a major factor in the\nsuper-cat business so long as prices are appropriate.\n\nWhat constitutes an appropriate price, of course, is\ndifficult to determine. Catastrophe insurers can't simply\nextrapolate past experience. If there is truly \"global warming,\"\nfor example, the odds would shift, since tiny changes in\natmospheric conditions can produce momentous changes in weather\npatterns. Furthermore, in recent years there has been a\nmushrooming of population and insured values in U. S. coastal\nareas that are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, the number\none creator of super-cats. A hurricane that caused\nx\ndollars of\ndamage 20 years ago could easily cost 10\nx\nnow.\n\nOccasionally, also, the unthinkable happens. Who would have\nguessed, for example, that a major earthquake could occur in\nCharleston, S. C.? (It struck in 1886, registered an estimated 6.6\non the Richter scale, and caused 60 deaths.) And who could have\nimagined that our country's most serious quake would occur at New\nMadrid, Missouri, which suffered an estimated 8.7 shocker in\n1812. By comparison, the 1989 San Francisco quake was a 7.1 -\nand remember that each one-point Richter increase represents a\nten-fold increase in strength. Someday, a U. S. earthquake\noccurring far from California will cause enormous losses for\ninsurers.\n\nWhen viewing our quarterly figures, you should understand\nthat our accounting for super-cat premiums differs from our\naccounting for other insurance premiums. Rather than recording\nour super-cat premiums on a pro-rata basis over the life of a\ngiven policy, we defer recognition of revenue until a loss occurs\nor until the policy expires. We take this conservative approach\nbecause the likelihood of super-cats causing us losses is\nparticularly great toward the end of the year. It is then that\nweather tends to kick up: Of the ten largest insured losses in\nU. S. history, nine occurred in the last half of the year. In\naddition, policies that are not triggered by a first event are\nunlikely, by their very terms, to cause us losses until late in\nthe year.\n\nThe bottom-line effect of our accounting procedure for\nsuper-cats is this: Large losses may be reported in any quarter\nof the year, but significant profits will only be reported in the\nfourth quarter.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAs I've told you in each of the last few years, what counts\nin our insurance business is \"the cost of funds developed from\ninsurance,\" or in the vernacular, \"the cost of float.\" Float -\nwhich we generate in exceptional amounts - is the total of loss\nreserves, loss adjustment expense reserves and unearned premium\nreserves minus agents' balances, prepaid acquisition costs and\ndeferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. The cost of\nfloat is measured by our underwriting loss.\n\nThe table below shows our cost of float since we entered the\nbusiness in 1967.",

Indeed, both of these\noperations recorded an underwriting profit last year, thereby\ngenerating float at a less-than-zero cost. The bulk of our float,\nmeanwhile, comes from large transactions developed by Ajit. His\nefforts are likely to produce a further growth in float during\n1993.\n\nCharlie and I continue to like the insurance business, which\nwe expect to be our main source of earnings for decades to come.\nThe industry is huge; in certain sectors we can compete world-wide;\nand Berkshire possesses an important competitive advantage.

    "content": "Common Stock Investments\n\nBelow we list our common stock holdings having a value of over\n$100 million. A small portion of these investments belongs to\nsubsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n\nLeaving aside splits, the number of shares we held in these\ncompanies changed during 1992 in only four cases: We added\nmoderately to our holdings in Guinness and Wells Fargo, we more\nthan doubled our position in Freddie Mac, and we established a new\nholding in General Dynamics. We like to buy.\n\nSelling, however, is a different story. There, our pace of\nactivity resembles that forced upon a traveler who found himself\nstuck in tiny Podunk's only hotel. With no T. V. in his room, he\nfaced an evening of boredom. But his spirits soared when he spied\na book on the night table entitled \"Things to do in Podunk.\"\nOpening it, he found just a single sentence: \"You're doing it.\"\n\nWe were lucky in our General Dynamics purchase. I had paid\nlittle attention to the company until last summer, when it\nannounced it would repurchase about 30% of its shares by way of a\nDutch tender. Seeing an arbitrage opportunity, I began buying the\nstock for Berkshire, expecting to tender our holdings for a small\nprofit. We've made the same sort of commitment perhaps a halfdozen times in the last few years, reaping decent rates of return\nfor the short periods our money has been tied up.\n\nBut then I began studying the company and the accomplishments\nof Bill Anders in the brief time he'd been CEO. And what I saw\nmade my eyes pop: Bill had a clearly articulated and rational\nstrategy; he had been focused and imbued with a sense of urgency in\ncarrying it out; and the results were truly remarkable.\n\nIn short order, I dumped my arbitrage thoughts and decided\nthat Berkshire should become a long-term investor with Bill. We\nwere helped in gaining a large position by the fact that a tender\ngreatly swells the volume of trading in a stock. In a one-month\nperiod, we were able to purchase 14% of the General Dynamics shares\nthat remained outstanding after the tender was completed.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nOur equity-investing strategy remains little changed from what\nit was fifteen years ago, when we said in the 1977 annual report:\n\"We select our marketable equity securities in much the way we\nwould evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety. We want\nthe business to be one (a) that we can understand; (b) with\nfavorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent\npeople; and (d) available at a very attractive price.\" We have\nseen cause to make only one change in this creed: Because of both\nmarket conditions and our size, we now substitute \"an attractive\nprice\" for \"a very attractive price.\"\n\nBut how, you will ask, does one decide what's \"attractive\"?\nIn answering this question, most analysts feel they must choose\nbetween two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition:\n\"value\" and \"growth.\" Indeed, many investment professionals see\nany mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual crossdressing.\n\nWe view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must be\nconfessed, I myself engaged some years ago). In our opinion, the\ntwo approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is\nalways\na component\nin the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose\nimportance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact\ncan be negative as well as positive.\n\nIn addition, we think the very term \"value investing\" is\nredundant. What is \"investing\" if it is not the act of seeking\nvalue at least sufficient to justify the amount paid? Consciously\npaying more for a stock than its calculated value - in the hope\nthat it can soon be sold for a still-higher price - should be\nlabeled speculation (which is neither illegal, immoral nor - in our\nview - financially fattening).",

    "content": "Whether appropriate or not, the term \"value investing\" is\nwidely used. Typically, it connotes the purchase of stocks having\nattributes such as a low ratio of price to book value, a low priceearnings ratio, or a high dividend yield. Unfortunately, such\ncharacteristics, even if they appear in combination, are far from\ndeterminative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something\nfor what it is worth and is therefore truly operating on the\nprinciple of obtaining value in his investments. Correspondingly,\nopposite characteristics - a high ratio of price to book value, a\nhigh price-earnings ratio, and a low dividend yield - are in no way\ninconsistent with a \"value\" purchase.\n\nSimilarly, business growth, per se, tells us little about\nvalue. It's true that growth often has a positive impact on value,\nsometimes one of spectacular proportions. But such an effect is\nfar from certain. For example, investors have regularly poured\nmoney into the domestic airline business to finance profitless (or\nworse) growth. For these investors, it would have been far better\nif Orville had failed to get off the ground at Kitty Hawk: The more\nthe industry has grown, the worse the disaster for owners.\n\nGrowth benefits investors only when the business in point can\ninvest at incremental returns that are enticing - in other words,\nonly when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a\ndollar of long-term market value. In the case of a low-return\nbusiness requiring incremental funds, growth hurts the investor.\n\nIn\nThe Theory of Investment Value\n, written over 50 years ago,\nJohn Burr Williams set forth the equation for value, which we\ncondense here:\nThe value of any stock, bond or business today is\ndetermined by the cash inflows and outflows - discounted at an\nappropriate interest rate - that can be expected to occur during\nthe remaining life of the asset.\nNote that the formula is the same\nfor stocks as for bonds. Even so, there is an important, and\ndifficult to deal with, difference between the two: A bond has a\ncoupon and maturity date that define future cash flows; but in the\ncase of equities, the investment analyst must himself estimate the\nfuture \"coupons.\" Furthermore, the quality of management affects\nthe bond coupon only rarely - chiefly when management is so inept\nor dishonest that payment of interest is suspended. In contrast,\nthe ability of management can dramatically affect the equity\n\"coupons.\"\n\nThe investment shown by the discounted-flows-of-cash\ncalculation to be the cheapest is the one that the investor should\npurchase - irrespective of whether the business grows or doesn't,\ndisplays volatility or smoothness in its earnings, or carries a\nhigh price or low in relation to its current earnings and book\nvalue. Moreover, though the value equation has usually shown\nequities to be cheaper than bonds, that result is not inevitable:\nWhen bonds are calculated to be the more attractive investment,\nthey should be bought.\n\nLeaving the question of price aside, the best business to own\nis one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of\nincremental capital at very high rates of return. The worst\nbusiness to own is one that must, or\nwill\n, do the opposite - that\nis, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low\nrates of return. Unfortunately, the first type of business is very\nhard to find: Most high-return businesses need relatively little\ncapital. Shareholders of such a business usually will benefit if\nit pays out most of its earnings in dividends or makes significant\nstock repurchases.",

First, we try to stick to businesses we\nbelieve we understand. That means they must be relatively simple\nand stable in character. If a business is complex or subject to\nconstant change, we're not smart enough to predict future cash\nflows. Incidentally, that shortcoming doesn't bother us. What\ncounts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but\nrather how realistically they define what they don't know. An\ninvestor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she\navoids big mistakes.\n\nSecond, and equally important, we insist on a margin of safety\nin our purchase price. If we calculate the value of a common stock\nto be only slightly higher than its price, we're not interested in\nbuying. We believe this margin-of-safety principle, so strongly\nemphasized by Ben Graham, to be the cornerstone of investment\nsuccess.",

    "content": "Fixed-Income Securities\n\nBelow we list our largest holdings of fixed-income securities:\n\nOver the years, we've done well with fixed-income investments,\nhaving realized from them both large capital gains (including $80\nmillion in 1992) and exceptional current income. Chrysler\nFinancial, Texaco, Time-Warner, WPPSS and RJR Nabisco were\nparticularly good investments for us. Meanwhile, our fixed-income\nlosses have been negligible: We've had thrills but so far no\nspills.\n\nDespite the success we experienced with our Gillette\npreferred, which converted to common stock in 1991, and despite our\nreasonable results with other negotiated purchases of preferreds,\nour overall performance with such purchases has been inferior to\nthat we have achieved with purchases made in the secondary market.\nThis is actually the result we expected. It corresponds with our\nbelief that an intelligent investor in common stocks will do better\nin the secondary market than he will do buying new issues.\n\nThe reason has to do with the way prices are set in each\ninstance. The secondary market, which is periodically ruled by\nmass folly, is constantly setting a \"clearing\" price. No matter\nhow foolish that price may be, it's what counts for the holder of a\nstock or bond who needs or wishes to sell, of whom there are always\ngoing to be a few at any moment. In many instances, shares worth\nx\n\nin business value have sold in the market for 1/2\nx\nor less.\n\nThe new-issue market, on the other hand, is ruled by\ncontrolling stockholders and corporations, who can usually select\nthe timing of offerings or, if the market looks unfavorable, can\navoid an offering altogether. Understandably, these sellers are\nnot going to offer any bargains, either by way of a public offering\nor in a negotiated transaction: It's rare you'll find\nx\nfor\n1/2\nx\nhere. Indeed, in the case of common-stock offerings, selling\nshareholders are often motivated to unload\nonly\nwhen they feel the\nmarket is overpaying. (These sellers, of course, would state that\nproposition somewhat differently, averring instead that they simply\nresist selling when the market is underpaying for their goods.)\n\nTo date, our negotiated purchases, as a group, have fulfilled\nbut not exceeded the expectation we set forth in our 1989 Annual\nReport: \"Our preferred stock investments should produce returns\nmodestly above those achieved by most fixed-income portfolios.\" In\ntruth, we would have done better if we could have put the money\nthat went into our negotiated transactions into open-market\npurchases of the type we like. But both our size and the general\nstrength of the markets made that difficult to do.\n\nThere was one other memorable line in the 1989 Annual Report:\n\"We have no ability to forecast the economics of the investment\nbanking business, the airline industry, or the paper industry.\" At\nthe time some of you may have doubted this confession of ignorance.\nNow, however, even my mother acknowledges its truth.\n\nIn the case of our commitment to USAir, industry economics had\nsoured before the ink dried on our check. As I've previously\nmentioned, it was I who happily jumped into the pool; no one pushed\nme. Yes, I knew the industry would be ruggedly competitive, but I\ndid not expect its leaders to engage in prolonged kamikaze\nbehavior. In the last two years, airline companies have acted as\nif they are members of a competitive tontine, which they wish to\nbring to its conclusion as rapidly as possible.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, Seth Schofield, CEO of USAir, has done a\ntruly extraordinary job in repositioning the airline. He was\nparticularly courageous in accepting a strike last fall that, had\nit been lengthy, might well have bankrupted the company.\nCapitulating to the striking union, however, would have been\nequally disastrous: The company was burdened with wage costs and\nwork rules that were considerably more onerous than those\nencumbering its major competitors, and it was clear that over time\nany high-cost producer faced extinction. Happily for everyone, the\nstrike was settled in a few days.",

    "content": "Two New Accounting Rules and a Plea for One More\n\nA new accounting rule having to do with deferred taxes becomes\neffective in 1993. It undoes a dichotomy in our books that I have\ndescribed in previous annual reports and that relates to the\naccrued taxes carried against the unrealized appreciation in our\ninvestment portfolio. At yearend 1992, that appreciation amounted\nto $7.6 billion. Against $6.4 billion of that, we carried taxes at\nthe current 34% rate. Against the remainder of $1.2 billion, we\ncarried an accrual of 28%, the tax rate in effect when that portion\nof the appreciation occurred. The new accounting rule says we must\nhenceforth accrue all deferred tax at the current rate, which to us\nseems sensible.\n\nThe new marching orders mean that in the first quarter of 1993\nwe will apply a 34% rate to all of our unrealized appreciation,\nthereby increasing the tax liability and reducing net worth by $70\nmillion. The new rule also will cause us to make other minor\nchanges in our calculation of deferred taxes.\n\nFuture changes in tax rates will be reflected immediately in\nthe liability for deferred taxes and, correspondingly, in net\nworth. The impact could well be substantial. Nevertheless, what\nis important in the end is the tax rate at the time we sell\nsecurities, when unrealized appreciation becomes realized.\n\nAnother major accounting change, whose implementation is\nrequired by January 1,1993, mandates that businesses recognize\ntheir present-value liability for post-retirement health benefits.\nThough GAAP has previously required recognition of pensions to be\npaid in the future, it has illogically ignored the costs that\ncompanies will then have to bear for health benefits. The new rule\nwill force many companies to record a huge balance-sheet liability\n(and a consequent reduction in net worth) and also henceforth to\nrecognize substantially higher costs when they are calculating\nannual profits.\n\nIn making acquisitions, Charlie and I have tended to avoid\ncompanies with significant post-retirement liabilities. As a\nresult, Berkshire's present liability and future costs for postretirement health benefits - though we now have 22,000 employees -\nare inconsequential. I need to admit, though, that we had a near\nmiss: In 1982 I made a huge mistake in committing to buy a company\nburdened by extraordinary post-retirement health obligations.\nLuckily, though, the transaction fell through for reasons beyond\nour control. Reporting on this episode in the 1982 annual report,\nI said: \"If we were to introduce graphics to this report,\nillustrating favorable business developments of the past year, two\nblank pages depicting this blown deal would be the appropriate\ncenterfold.\" Even so, I wasn't expecting things to get as bad as\nthey did. Another buyer appeared, the business soon went bankrupt\nand was shut down, and thousands of workers found those bountiful\nhealth-care promises to be largely worthless.\n\nIn recent decades, no CEO would have dreamed of going to his\nboard with the proposition that his company become an insurer of\nuncapped post-retirement health benefits that other corporations\nchose to install. A CEO didn't need to be a medical expert to know\nthat lengthening life expectancies and soaring health costs would\nguarantee an insurer a financial battering from such a business.\nNevertheless, many a manager blithely committed his own company to\na self-insurance plan embodying precisely the same promises - and\nthereby doomed his shareholders to suffer the inevitable\nconsequences. In health-care, open-ended promises have created\nopen-ended liabilities that in a few cases loom so large as to\nthreaten the global competitiveness of major American industries.",

    "content": "I believe part of the reason for this reckless behavior was\nthat accounting rules did not, for so long, require the booking of\npost-retirement health costs as they were incurred. Instead, the\nrules allowed cash-basis accounting, which vastly understated the\nliabilities that were building up. In effect, the attitude of both\nmanagements and their accountants toward these liabilities was\n\"out-of-sight, out-of-mind.\" Ironically, some of these same\nmanagers would be quick to criticize Congress for employing \"cashbasis\" thinking in respect to Social Security promises or other\nprograms creating future liabilities of size.\n\nManagers thinking about accounting issues should never forget\none of Abraham Lincoln's favorite riddles: \"How many legs does a\ndog have if you call his tail a leg?\" The answer: \"Four, because\ncalling a tail a leg does not make it a leg.\" It behooves managers\nto remember that Abe's right even if an auditor is willing to\ncertify that the tail is a leg.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThe most egregious case of let's-not-face-up-to-reality\nbehavior by executives and accountants has occurred in the world of\nstock options. In Berkshire's 1985 annual report, I laid out my\nopinions about the use and misuse of options. But even when\noptions are structured properly, they are accounted for in ways\nthat make no sense. The lack of logic is not accidental: For\ndecades, much of the business world has waged war against\naccounting rulemakers, trying to keep the costs of stock options\nfrom being reflected in the profits of the corporations that issue\nthem.\n\nTypically, executives have argued that options are hard to\nvalue and that therefore their costs should be ignored. At other\ntimes managers have said that assigning a cost to options would\ninjure small start-up businesses. Sometimes they have even\nsolemnly declared that \"out-of-the-money\" options (those with an\nexercise price equal to or above the current market price) have no\nvalue when they are issued.\n\nOddly, the Council of Institutional Investors has chimed in\nwith a variation on that theme, opining that options should not be\nviewed as a cost because they \"aren't dollars out of a company's\ncoffers.\" I see this line of reasoning as offering exciting\npossibilities to American corporations for instantly improving\ntheir reported profits. For example, they could eliminate the cost\nof insurance by paying for it with options. So if you're a CEO and\nsubscribe to this \"no cash-no cost\" theory of accounting, I'll make\nyou an offer you can't refuse: Give us a call at Berkshire and we\nwill happily sell you insurance in exchange for a bundle of longterm options on your company's stock.\n\nShareholders should understand that companies incur costs when\nthey deliver something of value to another party and not just when\ncash changes hands. Moreover, it is both silly and cynical to say\nthat an important item of cost should not be recognized simply\nbecause it can't be quantified with pinpoint precision. Right now,\naccounting abounds with imprecision. After all, no manager or\nauditor knows how long a 747 is going to last, which means he also\ndoes not know what the yearly depreciation charge for the plane\nshould be. No one knows with any certainty what a bank's annual\nloan loss charge ought to be. And the estimates of losses that\nproperty-casualty companies make are notoriously inaccurate.\n\nDoes this mean that these important items of cost should be\nignored simply because they can't be quantified with absolute\naccuracy? Of course not. Rather, these costs should be estimated\nby honest and experienced people and then recorded. When you get\nright down to it, what other item of major but hard-to-preciselycalculate cost - other, that is, than stock options - does the\naccounting profession say should be ignored in the calculation of\nearnings?",

These\nrestrictions affect value. They do not, however, eliminate it. In\nfact, since I'm in the mood for offers, I'll make one to any\nexecutive who is granted a restricted option, even though it may be\nout of the money: On the day of issue, Berkshire will pay him or\nher a substantial sum for the right to any future gain he or she\nrealizes on the option. So if you find a CEO who says his newlyissued options have little or no value, tell him to try us out. In\ntruth, we have far more confidence in our ability to determine an\nappropriate price to pay for an option than we have in our ability\nto determine the proper depreciation rate for our corporate jet.\n\nIt seems to me that the realities of stock options can be\nsummarized quite simply: If options aren't a form of compensation,\nwhat are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And,\nif expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in\nthe world should they go?\n\nThe accounting profession and the SEC should be shamed by the\nfact that they have long let themselves be muscled by business\nexecutives on the option-accounting issue.

First,\nGladys Kaiser, my friend and assistant for twenty-five years, will\ngive up the latter post after the 1993 annual meeting, though she\nwill certainly remain my friend forever. Gladys and I have been a\nteam, and though I knew her retirement was coming, it is still a\njolt.\n\nSecondly, in September, Verne Mc Kenzie relinquished his role\nas Chief Financial Officer after a 30-year association with me that\nbegan when he was the outside auditor of Buffett Partnership, Ltd.\nVerne is staying on as a consultant, and though that job\ndescription is often a euphemism, in this case it has real meaning.\nI expect Verne to continue to fill an important role at Berkshire\nbut to do so at his own pace. Marc Hamburg, Verne's understudy for\nfive years, has succeeded him as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nI recall that one woman, upon being asked to describe the\nperfect spouse, specified an archeologist: \"The older I get,\" she\nsaid, \"the more he'll be interested in me.\" She would have liked\nmy tastes: I treasure those extraordinary Berkshire managers who\nare working well past normal retirement age and who concomitantly\nare achieving results much superior to those of their younger\ncompetitors. While I understand and empathize with the decision of\nVerne and Gladys to retire when the calendar says it's time, theirs\nis not a step I wish to encourage. It's hard to teach a new dog\nold tricks.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nI am a moderate in my views about retirement compared to Rose\nBlumkin, better known as Mrs. B. At 99, she continues to work\nseven days a week. And about her, I have some particularly good\nnews.\n\nYou will remember that after her family sold 80% of Nebraska\nFurniture Mart (NFM) to Berkshire in 1983, Mrs. B continued to be\nChairman and run the carpet operation. In 1989, however, she left\nbecause of a managerial disagreement and opened up her own\noperation next door in a large building that she had owned for\nseveral years. In her new business, she ran the carpet section but\nleased out other home-furnishings departments.\n\nAt the end of last year, Mrs. B decided to sell her building\nand land to NFM. She'll continue, however, to run her carpet\nbusiness at its current location (no sense slowing down just when\nyou're hitting full stride). NFM will set up shop alongside her,\nin that same building, thereby making a major addition to its\nfurniture business.\n\nI am delighted that Mrs. B has again linked up with us. Her\nbusiness story has no parallel and I have always been a fan of\nhers, whether she was a partner or a competitor. But believe me,\npartner is better.\n\nThis time around, Mrs. B graciously offered to sign a noncompete agreement - and I, having been incautious on this point\nwhen she was 89, snapped at the deal. Mrs. B belongs in the\nGuinness Book of World Records on many counts. Signing a noncompete at 99 merely adds one more.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nRalph Schey, CEO of Scott Fetzer and a manager who I hope is\nwith us at 99 also, hit a grand slam last year when that company\nearned a record $110 million pre-tax. What's even more impressive\nis that Scott Fetzer achieved such earnings while employing only\n$116 million of equity capital. This extraordinary result is not\nthe product of leverage: The company uses only minor amounts of\nborrowed money (except for the debt it employs - appropriately - in\nits finance subsidiary).",

    "content": "Scott Fetzer now operates with a significantly smaller\ninvestment in both inventory and fixed assets than it had when we\nbought it in 1986. This means the company has been able to\ndistribute more than 100% of its earnings to Berkshire during our\nseven years of ownership while concurrently increasing its earnings\nstream - which was excellent to begin with - by a lot. Ralph just\nkeeps on outdoing himself, and Berkshire shareholders owe him a\ngreat deal.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThose readers with particularly sharp eyes will note that our\ncorporate expense fell from $5.6 million in 1991 to $4.2 million in\n1992. Perhaps you will think that I have sold our corporate jet,\nThe Indefensible. Forget it! I find the thought of retiring the\nplane even more revolting than the thought of retiring the\nChairman. (In this matter I've demonstrated uncharacteristic\nflexibility: For years I argued passionately against corporate\njets. But finally my dogma was run over by my karma.)\n\nOur reduction in corporate overhead actually came about\nbecause those expenses were especially high in 1991, when we\nincurred a one-time environmental charge relating to alleged pre 1970 actions of our textile operation. Now that things are back to\nnormal, our after-tax overhead costs are under 1% of our reported\noperating earnings and less than 1/2 of 1% of our look-through\nearnings. We have no legal, personnel, public relations, investor\nrelations, or strategic planning departments. In turn this means\nwe don't need support personnel such as guards, drivers,\nmessengers, etc. Finally, except for Verne, we employ no\nconsultants. Professor Parkinson would like our operation - though\nCharlie, I must say, still finds it outrageously fat.\n\nAt some companies, corporate expense runs 10% or more of\noperating earnings. The tithing that operations thus makes to\nheadquarters not only hurts earnings, but more importantly slashes\ncapital values. If the business that spends 10% on headquarters'\ncosts achieves earnings at its operating levels identical to those\nachieved by the business that incurs costs of only 1%, shareholders\nof the first enterprise suffer a 9% loss in the value of their\nholdings simply because of corporate overhead. Charlie and I have\nobserved no correlation between high corporate costs and good\ncorporate performance. In fact, we see the simpler, low-cost\noperation as more likely to operate effectively than its\nbureaucratic brethren. We're admirers of the Wal-Mart, Nucor,\nDover, GEICO, Golden West Financial and Price Co. models.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nLate last year Berkshire's stock price crossed $10,000.\nSeveral shareholders have mentioned to me that the high price\ncauses them problems: They like to give shares away each year and\nfind themselves impeded by the tax rule that draws a distinction\nbetween annual gifts of $10,000 or under to a single individual and\nthose above $10,000. That is, those gifts no greater than $10,000\nare completely tax-free; those above $10,000 require the donor to\nuse up a portion of his or her lifetime exemption from gift and\nestate taxes, or, if that exemption has been exhausted, to pay gift\ntaxes.\n\nI can suggest three ways to address this problem. The first\nwould be useful to a married shareholder, who can give up to\n$20,000 annually to a single recipient, as long as the donor files\na gift tax return containing his or her spouse's written consent to\ngifts made during the year.\n\nSecondly, a shareholder, married or not, can make a bargain\nsale. Imagine, for example, that Berkshire is selling for $12,000\nand that one wishes to make only a $10,000 gift. In that case,\nsell the stock to the giftee for $2,000. (Caution: You will be\ntaxed on the amount, if any, by which the sales price to your\ngiftee exceeds your tax basis.)",

    "content": "Finally, you can establish a partnership with people to whom\nyou are making gifts, fund it with Berkshire shares, and simply\ngive percentage interests in the partnership away each year. These\ninterests can be for any value that you select. If the value is\n$10,000 or less, the gift will be tax-free.\n\nWe issue the customary warning: Consult with your own tax\nadvisor before taking action on any of the more esoteric methods of\ngift-making.\n\nWe hold to the view about stock splits that we set forth in\nthe 1983 Annual Report. Overall, we believe our owner-related\npolicies - including the no-split policy - have helped us assemble\na body of shareholders that is the best associated with any widelyheld American corporation. Our shareholders think and behave like\nrational long-term owners and view the business much as Charlie and\nI do. Consequently, our stock consistently trades in a price range\nthat is sensibly related to intrinsic value.\n\nAdditionally, we believe that our shares turn over far less\nactively than do the shares of any other widely-held company. The\nfrictional costs of trading - which act as a major \"tax\" on the\nowners of many companies - are virtually non-existent at Berkshire.\n(The market-making skills of Jim Maguire, our New York Stock\nExchange specialist, definitely help to keep these costs low.)\nObviously a split would not change this situation dramatically.\nNonetheless, there is no way that our shareholder group would be\nupgraded by the new shareholders enticed by a split. Instead we\nbelieve that modest degradation would occur.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, on December 16 th we called our zerocoupon, convertible debentures for payment on January 4,1993.\nThese obligations bore interest at 5 1/2%, a low cost for funds\nwhen they were issued in 1989, but an unattractive rate for us at\nthe time of call.\n\nThe debentures could have been redeemed at the option of the\nholder in September 1994, and 5 1/2% money available for no longer\nthan that is not now of interest to us. Furthermore, Berkshire\nshareholders are disadvantaged by having a conversion option\noutstanding. At the time we issued the debentures, this\ndisadvantage was offset by the attractive interest rate they\ncarried; by late 1992, it was not.\n\nIn general, we continue to have an aversion to debt,\nparticularly the short-term kind. But we are willing to incur\nmodest amounts of debt when it is both properly structured and of\nsignificant benefit to shareholders.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAbout 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1992 shareholder-designated contributions program. Contributions\nmade through the program were $7.6 million, and 2,810 charities\nwere recipients. I'm considering increasing these contributions in\nthe future at a rate greater than the increase in Berkshire's book\nvalue, and I would be glad to hear from you as to your thinking\nabout this idea.\n\nWe suggest that new shareholders read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages\n48-49. To participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so\nregistered on August 31,1993 will be ineligible for the 1993\nprogram.\n\nIn addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that\nBerkshire distributes, managers of our operating businesses make\ncontributions, including merchandise, averaging about $2.0 million\nannually. These contributions support local charities, such as The\nUnited Way, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our\nbusinesses.\n\nHowever, neither our operating managers nor officers of the\nparent company use Berkshire funds to make contributions to broad\nnational programs or charitable activities of special personal\ninterest to them, except to the extent they do so as shareholders.\nIf your employees, including your CEO, wish to give to their alma\nmaters or other institutions to which they feel a personal\nattachment, we believe they should use their own money, not yours.",

We\nwill have buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8: 30 and 8: 45\nfor the meeting and return after it ends.\n\nCharlie and I always enjoy the meeting, and we hope you can\nmake it. The quality of our shareholders is reflected in the\nquality of the questions we get: We have never attended an annual\nmeeting anywhere that features such a consistently high level of\nintelligent, owner-related questions.\n\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. With\nthe admission card, we will enclose information about parking\nfacilities located near the Orpheum. If you are driving, come a\nlittle early. Nearby lots fill up quickly and you may have to walk\na few blocks.\n\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture\nMart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you from there to\ndowntown hotels or the airport later. I hope that you will allow\nplenty of time to fully explore the attractions of both stores.\nThose of you arriving early can visit the Furniture Mart any day of\nthe week; it is open from 10 a. m. to 5: 30 p. m. on Saturdays and\nfrom noon to 5: 30 p. m. on Sundays. While there, stop at the See's\nCandy Cart and find out for yourself why Charlie and I are a good\nbit wider than we were back in 1972 when we bought See's.\n\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p. m. on Sunday, April\n25. Charlie and I will be in attendance, sporting our jeweler's\nloupes, and ready to give advice about gems to anyone foolish\nenough to listen. Also available will be plenty of Cherry Cokes,\nSee's candies, and other lesser goodies. I hope you will join us.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 1,1993 Chairman of the Board",
