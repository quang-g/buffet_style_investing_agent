    "content": "A note to readers: Fifty years ago, today’s management took charge at Berkshire. For this Golden Anniversary,\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50\nyears and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what the\nother had written. Warren’s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie’s on page 39. Shareholders, particularly new\nones, may find it useful to read those letters before reading the report on 2014, which begins below.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2014 was $18.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 8.3%. Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over),\nper-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*\nDuring our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&P 500 to the change in\nBerkshire’s per-share book value. We’ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device\nfor the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.\nIn our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is\nnow. That was true because Berkshire’s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restated\nto reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of book\nvalue were “marked to market.”\nToday, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these\nare worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how\nmuch the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and its\nbook value has materially widened.\nWith that in mind, we have added a new set of data – the historical record of Berkshire’s stock price – to\nthe performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term.\nMonthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time,\nhowever, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman\nand my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire’s per-share\nintrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company’s\nshares.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500 th of\nthose shown for A.",

    "content": "The Year at Berkshire\nIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:\n• Our “Powerhouse Five” – a collection of Berkshire’s largest non-insurance businesses – had a record $12.4\nbillion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group are\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly Mid American Energy), BNSF, IMC (I’ve called it Iscar in the past),\nLubrizol and Marmon.\nOf the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago.\nSubsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, we\npaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the\nnumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire by\nthe five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our\ngoal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\nIf the U. S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improve\nas well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that have\nalready closed or are under contract.\n• Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During the\nyear, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures can\nbadly hurt their businesses.\nBNSF is, by far, Berkshire’s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, we\nwill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015. That sum is nearly 50% more than any other railroad\nhas spent in a single year and is a truly extraordinary amount, whether compared to revenues, earnings or\ndepreciation charges.\nThough weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating\nproblems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That\ncan’t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disrupts\noperations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show\nresults. During the last three months, BNSF’s performance metrics have materially improved from last\nyear’s figures.\n• Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.1 billion last year, up from $4.7 billion in\n2013. Here, as with our Powerhouse Five, we expect further gains in 2015. Within this group, we have two\ncompanies that last year earned between $400 million and $600 million, six that earned between $250\nmillion and $400 million, and seven that earned between $100 million and $250 million. This collection of\nbusinesses will increase in both number and earnings. Our ambitions have no finish line.\n• Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2014 – that\nmakes 12 years in a row – and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float – money that\ndoesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – has grown from $41 billion to $84\nbillion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, float\ngenerates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.\n* Throughout this letter, as well as in the “Golden Anniversary” letters included later in this report, all earnings are\nstated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.",

    "content": "Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billion\nearned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million.\n• While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on\nacquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8\nbillion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, the\nlargest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed under\nMarmon’s jurisdiction.\nCharlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren’t.) They deploy\ncapital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert\nmanagers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularly\nappealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.\n• Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3 G Capital group in the\nacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnership\nwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint. And it most definitely has.\nI’m not embarrassed to admit that Heinz is run far better under Alex Behring, Chairman, and Bernardo\nHees, CEO, than would be the case if I were in charge. They hold themselves to extraordinarily high\nperformance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors.\nWe expect to partner with 3 G in more activities. Sometimes our participation will only involve a financing\nrole, as was the case in the recent acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King. Our favored arrangement,\nhowever, will usually be to link up as a permanent equity partner (who, in some cases, contributes to the\nfinancing of the deal as well). Whatever the structure, we feel good when working with Jorge Paulo.\nBerkshire also has fine partnerships with Mars and Leucadia, and we may form new ones with them or with\nother partners. Our participation in any joint activities, whether as a financing or equity partner, will be\nlimited to friendly transactions.\n• In October, we contracted to buy Van Tuyl Automotive, a group of 78 automobile dealerships that is\nexceptionally well-run. Larry Van Tuyl, the company’s owner, and I met some years ago. He then decided\nthat if he were ever to sell his company, its home should be Berkshire. Our purchase was recently\ncompleted, and we are now “car guys.”\nLarry and his dad, Cecil, spent 62 years building the group, following a strategy that made owner-partners\nof all local managers. Creating this mutuality of interests proved over and over to be a winner. Van Tuyl is\nnow the fifth-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that are\noutstanding.\nIn recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. There\nare about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by the\nrelevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire’s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers to\nwelcome further purchases by us. If we do this – and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices – we will\nbuild a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl’s $9 billion of sales.\n⁄\nWith the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 91 companies that would be listed on the Fortune\n⁄ ⁄\n500 were they independent (Heinz is the 1 ). That leaves 4901 fish in the sea. Our lines are out.\n2 2",

    "content": "• Our subsidiaries spent a record $15 billion on plant and equipment during 2014, well over twice their\ndepreciation charges. About 90% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we will always\ninvest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America. The treasures that have been\nuncovered up to now are dwarfed by those still untapped. Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born in\nthe United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has given\nus.\n• Berkshire’s yearend employees – including those at Heinz – totaled a record 340,499, up 9,754 from last\nyear. The increase, I am proud to say, included no gain at headquarters (where 25 people work). No sense\ngoing crazy.\n• Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – American\nExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our\nownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, American\nExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from\n9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership of\nWells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder this\nmath: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raises\nBerkshire’s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.\nThese four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a\nwonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope\nDiamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nIf Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2014 earnings\nbefore discontinued operations amounted to $4.7 billion (compared to $3.3 billion only three years ago). In\nthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive – about $1.6 billion last\nyear. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.) But make no mistake: The $3.1 billion of\nthese companies’ earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a move that\nenhances Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Their retained\nearnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to\nexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time\n(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gains\nmaterialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital\ngains. (For the package of four, our unrealized gains already totaled $42 billion at yearend.)\nOur flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses – gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they can\noperate. Our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding\nsensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash.\n• I’ve mentioned in the past that my experience in business helps me as an investor and that my investment\nexperience has made me a better businessman. Each pursuit teaches lessons that are applicable to the other.\nAnd some truths can only be fully learned through experience. (In Fred Schwed’s wonderful book, Where\nAre the Customers’ Yachts?, a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while a\ncaption says, “There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or\npictures.” If you haven’t read Schwed’s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor are\ntruly priceless.)",

    "content": "Among Arno’s “certain things,” I would include two separate skills, the evaluation of investments and the\nmanagement of businesses. I therefore think it’s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our two\ninvestment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity for\nthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, though\nsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn\n$100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.\nI’ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the very\nlimited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of work\nand, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to say\namong the best).\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire’s history. At the time, I called the transaction an “all-in wager on the economic future of the United\nStates.”\nThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us. We’ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a\n“bet” on ever-rising U. S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\nIndeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting against America? If you compare our\ncountry’s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real\nper-capita U. S. output has sextupled. My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see.\nThough the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America’s problems, I’ve never seen one who wishes to\nemigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).\nThe dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won’t come in a\nsmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government. But, most\nassuredly, America’s best days lie ahead.\nWith this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by\n(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings\nthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares\nwhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large\nacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway\nEnergy will still be playing vital roles in our economy. Homes and autos will remain central to the lives of most\nfamilies. Insurance will continue to be essential for both businesses and individuals. Looking ahead, Charlie and I\nsee a world made to order for Berkshire. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the\nthree elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsic\nvalue. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 123-124.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2014 our per-share investments increased 8.4% to\n$140,123, and our earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 19% to $10,847 per\nshare.",

    "content": "Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19% compounded annually, and our\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 44\nyears has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both\nsectors, but our main focus is to build operating earnings. That’s why we were pleased to exchange our Phillips 66\nand Graham Holdings stock for operating businesses last year and to contract with Procter and Gamble to acquire\nDuracell by means of a similar exchange set to close in 2015.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nNow, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and\nI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being the\nreporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don’t get any ideas!)\nInsurance\nLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has\npropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &\nMarine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution was\nsimplicity itself.\nJack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to my\noffice saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack’s companies had ever had an\naudit by a public accounting firm, and I didn’t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also a\nbit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.\n⁄\nOn pages 128-129, we reproduce the 11 -page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction.\nThat contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire’s best deal: National\nIndemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds that\nof any other insurer in the world.\nOne reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/C\ninsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain\nworkers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model\nleaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,\ninsurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of\nfloat an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business\ngrows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear Float (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 237\n1990 1,632\n2000 27,871\n2010 65,832\n2014 83,921\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercial\ninsurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is\nparty to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it\nwill be very gradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that\nwe can never be subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strength\nis a key pillar in Berkshire’s economic fortress.",

    "content": "If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\n• and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the\ninsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning\nsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low\ninterest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profit\nproblems of the industry.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for\ntwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we\nwill continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers,\nwho know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message is\ngiven at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount\nof our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think\nof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims\nand related expenses – a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 – and that reduces float. Just\nas surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out the\ndoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid\nfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing\non its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any\ngoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (with\nwhich we agree) this excess value will never be entered on our books. But I can assure you that it’s real. That’s one\nreason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,\nmost important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that\nare inappropriate in relation to our resources.",

    "content": "Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything\nit has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its\nmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a market\nthat might well have gone into shock. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red, if not\nfacing insolvency.\nAjit’s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always looking\nfor more lines of business he can add to his current assortment. Last year I told you about his formation of Berkshire\nHathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly\nwelcomed by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. Previously, we had\nwritten only a few specialized lines of commercial insurance.\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\nworld. During 2014, Peter expanded his talented group, moving into both international business and new lines of\ninsurance. We repeat last year’s prediction that BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generate\nvolume in the billions within a few years.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both\nprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate\npremium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”\nspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge\nfloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.\nWe are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown\nconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused\ncommentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Re\nis now a gem.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 64 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 53 years of service in 2014. Tony became CEO in 1993, and\nsince then the company has been flying. There is no better manager than Tony.\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO\nwould succeed because it deserved to succeed. No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes\nto drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and\nonly a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by\ninsuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico. com or call 800-368-2734.",

(We ended 2014 at 10.8% compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) The\ncompany’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. Our gecko never tires\nof telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. The gecko, I should add, has one particularly\nendearing quality – he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from his\nfame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation that\nconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Indeed, over the past decade, they have earned $2.95 billion from\nunderwriting while growing their float from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion. Charlie and I treasure these companies and\ntheir managers.\n[TABLE — see child chunk 2014-S02-T2-001]\nSimply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises to\npay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their\n20 s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails when\npayment time arrives, is all-important.\nBerkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world’s largest and\nmost sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities.\nThat is, these insurers wished to “cede” these liabilities – most of them potential losses from asbestos claims – to a\nreinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hook\nfor it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatens\nthe original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.\nLast year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billion\nsingle premium. I believe that the policy’s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd’s, in\nwhich the premium was $7.1 billion.\nIn fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion. And,\nyes, all eight were written by Berkshire. Certain of these contracts will require us to make substantial payments 50\nyears or more from now. When major insurers have needed an unquestionable promise that payments of this type\nwill be made, Berkshire has been the party – the only party – to call.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by\nwide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for\nBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.",

    "content": "Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), that share important\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in\nthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceed\nits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was more than 8: 1. (Our definition of\ncoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.\nThe first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an\nessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earnings\nstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Recently, we have further\nbroadened that base through our $3 billion (Canadian) acquisition of Alta Link, an electric transmission system\nserving 85% of Alberta’s population. This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage of\nbeing owned by a strong parent, has enabled BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt.\nThis economic fact benefits both us and our customers.\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n• BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nestablishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system.\nBNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally\nfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on\nthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\n• BHE’s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. In\naddition, we are a leader in renewables: From a standing start ten years ago, BHE now accounts for 6% of\nthe country’s wind generation capacity and 7% of its solar generation capacity. Beyond these businesses,\nBHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country’s natural gas consumption; the recentlypurchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U. K. and\nPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout the\nworld for decades to come.\nBHE can make these investments because it retains all of its earnings. In fact, last year the company\nretained more dollars of earnings – by far – than any other American electric utility. We and our\nregulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage – one almost certain to distinguish\nBHE from other utilities for many years to come.\nWhen BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company’s renewables portfolio\nwill have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions.\nWe relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns – and, on that front, we put a large\namount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital\nproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our\nself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they\nrepresent.",

    "content": "Last year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our rates\nremain low, our customer satisfaction is high and our record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.\nThe story at BNSF, however – as I noted earlier – was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad\ndisappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF has\nmade in recent years, with those having far exceeded the outlays made by Union Pacific, our principal competitor.\nThe two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably more\nfreight (measured either by carloads or ton-miles). But our service problems exceeded Union Pacific’s last year, and\nwe lost market share as a result. Moreover, U. P.’s earnings beat ours by a record amount. Clearly, we have a lot of\nwork to do.\nWe are wasting no time: As I also mentioned earlier, we will spend $6 billion in 2015 on improving our\nrailroad’s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as the\nindustry’s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentage\ncompares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U. P.’s projection for the near future of 16-17%. Our huge\ninvestments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits should\nfollow.\nHere are the key figures for Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF:\n[TABLE — see child chunk 2014-S02-T2-002]\n[TABLE — see child chunk 2014-S02-T2-003]",

In contrast, the operating expense\nfigures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain\nintangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more\naccurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAP\nfigures.\nI won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are tiny and arcane – but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no way lose value. For\nsoftware, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges against\nother intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accounting\nrules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.\nBoth, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though from an investor’s viewpoint\nthey could not be more different.",

    "content": "In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have been\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once nonexistent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real\namortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.\nThe GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have\n$7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course,\nevery dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even if\ntrue earnings are flat.\nDepreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report\nis a real cost. That’s true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wire\nthem up for a polygraph test.\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,\nyou should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nTo get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, they sell products ranging from\nlollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets,\nenjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good\nreturns in the area of 12% to 20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, the result of some serious mistakes I\nmade in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic\ndynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates.\nFortunately, my blunders normally involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally\nworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, nonetheless, made my last mistake in purchasing\neither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average\nof $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2014 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and using\nlittle leverage, earned 18.7% after-tax on that capital.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought for too high a price. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large\nfigure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in\nthis sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a good\nmargin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in\nboth the insurance and regulated-industry segments is far greater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if\nothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,\ntherefore, we only disclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations,\nhowever, on pages 97-100.",

    "content": "Finance and Financial Products\nThis year we include in this section Marmon’s very sizable leasing operations, whose wares are railcars,\ncontainers and cranes. We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? At\none time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of the\ncompany’s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gain\nmore insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon’s leasing operations under this heading. (The figures\nfor the many dozens of Marmon’s other businesses remain in the previous section.)\nOur other leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture) and XTRA (semi-trailers).\nThese companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has\ngained strength. Both companies have invested more money in new equipment than have many of their competitors,\nand that’s paying off.\nKevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the largest home\nbuilder in America. Last year, Clayton sold 30,871 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought by\nAmericans. When we purchased Clayton in 2003 for $1.7 billion, its share was 14%.\nKey to Clayton’s earnings is the company’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. During the financial panic of\n2008 and 2009, when funding for the industry dried up, Clayton was able to keep lending because of Berkshire’s\nbacking. In fact, we continued during that period to finance our competitors’ retail sales as well as our own.\nMany of Clayton’s borrowers have low incomes and mediocre FICO scores. But thanks to the company’s\nsensible lending practices, its portfolio performed well during the recession, meaning a very high percentage of our\nborrowers kept their homes. Our blue-collar borrowers, in many cases, proved much better credit risks than their\nhigher-income brethren.\nAt Marmon’s railroad-car operation, lease rates have improved substantially over the past few years. The\nnature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improved\npricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleet\nconsists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.\nOne further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, we\nmanufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book any profit when we transfer\ncars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a\n“bargain” price. The difference between that figure and a “retail” price is only slowly reflected in our earnings\nthrough smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car. Because of that fact as\nwell as others, Marmon’s rail fleet is worth considerably more than the $5 billion figure at which it is carried on our\nbooks.\nHere’s the earnings recap for this sector:\n[TABLE — see child chunk 2014-S03-T2-001]",

    "content": "In 2013, I soured somewhat on the company’s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing a\nprofit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior\n“thumb-sucking.” (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)\nDuring 2014, Tesco’s problems worsened by the month. The company’s market share fell, its margins\ncontracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a\ncockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.\nWe sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. (The company, we should\nmention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444\nmillion, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire’s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investment\nloss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses. All three of these losses\noccurred in the 1974-1975 period, when we sold stocks that were very cheap in order to buy others we believed to\nbe even cheaper.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur investment results have been helped by a terrific tailwind. During the 1964-2014 period, the S&P 500\nrose from 84 to 2,059, which, with reinvested dividends, generated the overall return of 11,196% shown on page 2.\nConcurrently, the purchasing power of the dollar declined a staggering 87%. That decrease means that it now takes\n$1 to buy what could be bought for 13¢ in 1965 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).\nThere is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars.\nThink back to our 2011 annual report, in which we defined investing as “the transfer to others of purchasing power\nnow with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power – after taxes have been paid on nominal\ngains – in the future.”\nThe unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far\nsafer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities – Treasuries, for\nexample – whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, a\nperiod including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree or\nanother it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century.\nStock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term, however,\ncurrency-denominated instruments are riskier investments – far riskier investments – than widely-diversified stock\nportfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. That\nlesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy for\nrisk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is far from\nsynonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.\nIt is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and\npurchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors – say,\ninvestment banks – whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sell\nsecurities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for funds\nshould keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.\nFor the great majority of investors, however, who can – and should – invest with a multi-decade horizon,\nquotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasing\npower over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less\nrisky than dollar-based securities.",

    "content": "If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may,\nironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned falling\nstock prices and advised investing in “safe” Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded this\nsermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (The\nS&P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, these\ninvestors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fund\nwhose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups and\ndowns, to be sure).\nInvestors, of course, can, by their own behavior, make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active\ntrading, attempts to “time” market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary fees\nto managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner of\nequities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has no place in the investor’s tool kit: Anything can\nhappen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator – and definitely not Charlie nor I – can\ntell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.\nThe commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to “the little guy.” Huge institutional\ninvestors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sits\ntight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn,\nrecommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool’s game.\nThere are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good – though in the short run, it’s difficult\nto determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high\nfees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to\ntheir siren songs, investors – large and small – should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense\nInvesting.\nDecades ago, Ben Graham pinpointed the blame for investment failure, using a quote from Shakespeare:\n“The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 2 nd at the Century Link Center. Last year’s attendance\nof 39,000 set a record, and we expect a further increase this year as we celebrate our Golden Anniversary. Be there\nwhen the doors open at 7 a. m.\nBerkshire’s talented Carrie Sova will again be in charge. Carrie joined us six years ago at the age of 24 as\na secretary. Then, four years ago, I asked her to take charge of the meeting – a huge undertaking, requiring a\nmultitude of skills – and she jumped at the chance. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the\nbest in the hundreds who work with her. She is aided by our entire home office crew who enjoy pitching in to make\nthe weekend fun and informative for our owners.\nAnd, yes, we also try to sell our visiting shareholders our products while they’re here. In fact, this year\nwe will substantially increase the hours available for purchases, opening for business at the Century Link on Friday,\nMay 1 st, from noon to 5 p. m. as well as the usual 7 a. m. to 4 p. m. on meeting day. So bring a smile to Charlie’s face\nand do some serious shopping.\nGet up early on Saturday morning. At 6: 20 a. m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighing\nabout a ton, will proceed down 10 th Street to the Century Link. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Boot\nexecutives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargo\nstagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to our\nportfolio should seal our reputation as America’s all-purpose transportation company.",

Our\ntarget again will be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager\n• in my one brief flirtation with honest labor – I tossed about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good. Challenge\nme! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! I’ll buy a Dilly Bar for anyone who lands his or her throw closer to the\ndoorstep than I do. The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).\nI’ll present a special prize to the 12-or-under contestant who makes the best toss. Deb Bosanek will be the judge.\nAt 8: 30 a. m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at Century Link’s stands) will last until 3: 30 p. m. After a short recess, Charlie\nand I will convene the annual meeting at 3: 45 p. m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. If you don’t get your shopping done on Friday, slip\nout while Charlie’s talking on Saturday and binge on our bargains. Check the terrific BNSF railroad layout also.\nEven though I’m 84, it still excites me.\nLast year you did your part as a shopper, and most of our businesses racked up record sales. In a nine-hour\nperiod on Saturday, we sold 1,385 pairs of Justin boots (that’s a pair every 23 seconds), 13,440 pounds of See’s\ncandy, 7,276 pairs of Wells Lamont work gloves and 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup. Heinz has a new mustard\nproduct, so both mustard and ketchup will be available this year. (Buy both!) Now that we are open for business on\nFriday as well, we expect new records in every precinct.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the\nmeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our third annual “Berkshire 5 K,” an 8 a. m. race\nstarting at the Century Link. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to\nyou with your credentials for the meeting. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of\nBerkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in.)\nA GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from\naround the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount\n(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental\npoint: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)\nBring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new\ntitles. Last year, many shareholders purchased Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965,\nand he has produced an updated edition for the meeting. We also expect to be selling an inexpensive book\ncommemorating our fifty years. It’s currently a work in process, but I expect it to contain a wide variety of historical\nmaterial, including documents from the 19 th Century.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up\nprices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.\n⁄\nOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21 hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\nsignificant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to\n$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the store did\na record $40,481,817 of business. (An average week for NFM’s Omaha store is about $9 million.)",

    "content": "To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 28 th\nand Monday, May 4 th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even\napply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but\nwhich, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.\nNFM is open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m. Monday through Friday, 10 a. m. to 9: 30 p. m. on Saturday and 10 a. m. to 8 p. m.\non Sunday. From 5: 30 p. m. to 8 p. m. on Saturday, NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\n6 p. m. to 9 p. m. on Friday, May 1 st. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3 rd, from 9 a. m. to 4\np. m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p. m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded our sales\nin all of December, normally a jeweler’s best month.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27 th through Saturday, May 9 th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you\nare a Berkshire holder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will\nbewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge\nexperts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don’t play them for money.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met\nAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a sophomore at\nPrinceton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing\nyourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p. m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.\nGorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3 rd.\nBoth will be serving until 10 p. m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p. m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p. m. These restaurants\nare my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s,\ncall 402-551-3733 on April 1 st (but not before); for Piccolo’s, call 402-346-2865. At Piccolo’s, order a giant root\nbeer float for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the\nmeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and\ntheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, who retired last year after sixty years at Fortune, but remains the expert on\nbusiness and financial matters, and who may be e-mailed at loomisbrk@gmail. com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at\nBerkshire Questions@cnbc. com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes. com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most\ninteresting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you\nkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two\nquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name\nmentioned if your question is asked.)\nWe will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will\nbe Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from\nJonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hope is that the analysts and\njournalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.",

    "content": "Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that’s the way we like it. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each\nanalyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 62 in total.) The questioners from the\naudience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8: 15 a. m. on the morning of the annual\nmeeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, a\ndrawing.\nWhile I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and should also have\nadequate time to analyze it. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why\nour annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or\nanalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe get terrific help at meeting time from literally thousands of Omaha residents and businesses who\nwant you to enjoy yourselves. This year, because we expect record attendance, we have worried about a shortage of\nhotel rooms. To deal with that possible problem, Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the period\naround meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb’s services may be\nespecially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year a\nfew hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tight\nbudget should check the Airbnb website.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of our\nmanagers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies.\nMost of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to\nthem as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\ngroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 24,100-page Federal\nincome tax return and oversees the filing of 3,400 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media\ninquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s\nactivities – and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40\nuniversities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle\nall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered in\nHeinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.\nLast year, for the annual report, we dropped our 48-year-old “no pictures” policy – who says I’m not\nflexible? – and ran a photo of our remarkable home-office crew that was taken at our Christmas lunch. I didn’t warn\nthe gang of the public exposure they were to receive, so they didn’t have on their Sunday best. This year was a\ndifferent story: On the facing page you will see what our group looks like when they think someone will be noticing.\nHowever they dress, their performance is mind-boggling.\nCome meet them on May 2 nd and enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.\nFebruary 27,2015\nWarren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",

    "content": "Berkshire – Past, Present and Future\nIn the Beginning\nOn May 6,1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to its\nshareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I was\nsurprised by the price.\nBerkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership\nLtd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before the\ntender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and he\nsaid, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton’s\nbehavior and didn’t tender.\nThat was a monumentally stupid decision.\nBerkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it\noperated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unable\nto change course.\nThat was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s own\nBoard minutes of July 29,1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out of\nbusiness forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply and\ndemand have been balanced.”\nAbout a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing –\nboth with roots in the 19 th Century – joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and\n10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managements\nviewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following the\nconsolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.\nMeanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase\nshares. And that pattern caught my attention.\nI purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more\nrepurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 and\nbook value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff\nremaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasure\nwas enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.\nBerkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set\nout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of our\noriginal purchases. There it was – my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for other\ndiscarded butts.\nInstead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire\nshares.",

Better yet,\nits earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisen\nfrom the disastrous results in earlier years.\nThen the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the\ntextile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness – stupidity? – has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the towel\nand closed the operation.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nUndeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL’s resources to a dying business, I quickly\ncompounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the most\ncostly in my career.\nEarly in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a small but\npromising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweet\nspot: I understood and liked the industry.\nJack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me – me, personally. In\nno way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I’ve\nhad 48 years to think about that question, and I’ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossal\nmistake.\nIf BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to\nform the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impeded\nfor nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequent\nacquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by the\nlegacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I opted\nto marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decision\nthat eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOne more confession and then I’ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought\nWaumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a “bargain” based on the\nassets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire’s existing textile business. Nevertheless – surprise,\nsurprise – Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.\nAnd now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if you\nhear that I’ve been spotted wandering around New England.",

    "content": "Charlie Straightens Me Out\nMy cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens of\nfree puffs I obtained in the 1950 s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absolute\ninvestment performance.\nEven then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a\n1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learned\nthat GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gains\nin those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. Ben\nGraham had taught me that technique, and it worked.\nBut a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only\nto a point. With large sums, it would never work well.\nIn addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-term\ninvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriage\npartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been a\nhighly satisfactory “date”: If we had taken Seabury Stanton’s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL’s weighted annual\nreturn on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.)\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIt took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that could\ncombine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and as\na youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather’s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, long\nafter he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor who\nintroduced us predicted that we would hit it off – and we did.\nIf you’ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious\nmemory, and some firm opinions. I’m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don’t agree. In 56 years,\nhowever, we’ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: “Warren,\nthink it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.”\nWhat most of you do not know about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began\nhis career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30 s\nby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that he\nlives in today – some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can’t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recent\nyears, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91,\nis working on another major project.\nFrom my perspective, though, Charlie’s most important architectural feat was the design of today’s\nBerkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful\nprices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.",

    "content": "Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without\nCharlie’s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when – ahem – I\nhad attended three). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his\nlogic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie’s blueprint. My role has been that of general\ncontractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire’s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.\nThe year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part –\nremember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See’s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps,\na company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.\nSee’s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning\nabout $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a huge\nasset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significant\npricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See’s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, these\nwould materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See’s could be expected to\ngush cash for decades to come.\nThe family controlling See’s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth that\nmuch. But I didn’t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn’t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A price\nthat was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrific\npurchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.\nTo date, See’s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only\n$40 million. See’s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that,\nin turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, through\nwatching See’s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes to\nmany other profitable investments.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nEven with Charlie’s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was\nDexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like a\ncigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simply\ndidn’t see that coming.\nConsequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP\naccounting, however, doesn’t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshire\nstock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7\nbillion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nSeveral of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose\nearnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderful\nbusiness – which Berkshire most certainly is – for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.\nWe’ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares\nBerkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seem\nblind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater than\nthe intrinsic value of the business you receive.",

    "content": "Berkshire Today\nBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.\nConglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly\ndeserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why the\nconglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.\nSince I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, the\nsilliest of which occurred in the late 1960 s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality,\npromotion or dubious accounting – and often by all three – these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate’s stock\nto, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-so\ntimes earnings. They immediately applied “pooling” accounting to the acquisition, which – with not a dime’s worth\nof change in the underlying businesses – automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof of\nmanagerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even the\nenhancement, of the acquirer’s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure and\nthereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.\nWall Street’s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960 s rolled by. The Street’s denizens are\nalways ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings,\nparticularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willingly\nsprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates’ accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how to\nfurther juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.\nSince the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, its\nCEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristically\nmediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate’s\ncollection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was deal\nvelocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.\nThe resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, Litton\nIndustries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famous\nconglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, “Every Napoleon meets his Watergate.”)\nBack then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts – many of them ridiculously transparent – were excused or\noverlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a huge\nplus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reported earnings would never disappoint, no matter how\nbad the operating realities of the business might become.\nIn the late 1960 s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his “bold, imaginative\naccounting.” Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found a\nmanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.",

That\nbehavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that is\noverpriced and – all too often – outright dishonesty.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSo what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire’s conglomerate structure? To put the case\nsimply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capital\ngrowth.\nOne of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that markets\nwill direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all its\nexcesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.\nNevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire\nminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed for\ndecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning our\nobsolete textile mills for far too long.\nA CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital into\nunrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes be\nadmitted. Moreover, it’s unlikely that CEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment job\neven if he or she was inclined to undertake it.\nAt the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attempt\nto reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as they\nmove capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes then\nclamor to be fed – among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocators\nas leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don’t come cheap.\nIn contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and at\nminimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will make\nmore. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.\nAt Berkshire, we can – without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs – move huge sums from\nbusinesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise.\nMoreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject to\npressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That’s important: If horses had\ncontrolled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.",

    "content": "Another major advantage we possess is the ability to buy pieces of wonderful businesses – a. k. a. common\nstocks. That’s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative has\nproved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offered\nby the stock market every day – in small pieces, to be sure – are often far more attractive than the businesses we are\nconcurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we’ve realized from marketable securities have\nhelped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.\nIn effect, the world is Berkshire’s oyster – a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those\nrealistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we can\nevaluate. And that’s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like ten\nyears from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has been\nconfined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a far larger size than the many businesses\nthat are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.\nI mentioned earlier that See’s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital\nrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. But\nour many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we have\nused the excess funds generated by See’s to help purchase other businesses. If See’s had remained a stand-alone\ncompany, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavily\ndepleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now the\nhome of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.\nFamilies that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, the\nbest decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understands\nwell. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)\nWhen one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makes\nsense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.\nThe first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing “synergies” from the\ncombining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller’s\nassociates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however – and there are\nplenty of them – usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: “She got\nthe goldmine, I got the shaft.”\nThe second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately called\nthemselves “leveraged buyout firms.” When that term got a bad name in the early 1990 s – remember RJR and\nBarbarians at the Gate? – these buyers hastily relabeled themselves “private-equity.”\nThe name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reduced and debt is piled on in\nvirtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in part\ndetermined by the buyer assessing the maximum amount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.",

    "content": "Later, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leverage\nwith new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharply\ndownward, sometimes even to a negative figure.\nIn truth, “equity” is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debt\nis currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often to\nanother leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.\nBerkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which the\ncompany’s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyond\nthat, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealing\nwith banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.\nSome sellers don’t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of\ncompetition.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no\nsense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability to\nmove funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicate\nthemselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here’s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominal\ncosts for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directors\nwould soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.\nFinally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. For\nexample, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate huge\namounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantage\nover most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.\nInvestment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50%\npremiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for\n“control value” and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer’s CEO takes charge. (What\nacquisition-hungry manager will challenge that assertion?)\nA few years later, bankers – bearing straight faces – again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the\nearlier acquisition in order to “unlock shareholder value.” Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of its\npurported “control value” without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company will\nflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracy\nof the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)\nIf the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be\nurged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege. (Mental “flexibility” of this sort by the\nbanking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading to\nfees.)\nIt’s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators.\nBerkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divest\na bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.",

    "content": "Voluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation\nflexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now would\nhave difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantages\nderived from Berkshire’s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likely\nincur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBefore I depart the subject of spin-offs, let’s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned\nearlier: LTV. I’ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about Jimmy\nLing that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.\nThrough a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 to\nnumber 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerial\nskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had no\npeer in that respect.\nLing’s strategy, which he labeled “project redeployment,” was to buy a large company and then partially\nspin off its various divisions. In LTV’s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: “Most\nimportantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.” The press, the public and Wall\nStreet loved this sort of talk.\nIn 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment and\npharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson Sporting\nGoods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly became\nknown on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.\nSoon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970 s,\nLing’s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is, fired.\nPeriodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality – you can count on that. More Jimmy\nLings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers will\nfight for their business. What they are saying will recently have “worked.” Their early followers will be feeling very\nclever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells you\nhow old-fashioned that math is --- zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks at\ncheap prices.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nToday Berkshire possesses (1) an unmatched collection of businesses, most of them now enjoying\nfavorable economic prospects; (2) a cadre of outstanding managers who, with few exceptions, are unusually devoted\nto both the subsidiary they operate and to Berkshire; (3) an extraordinary diversity of earnings, premier financial\nstrength and oceans of liquidity that we will maintain under all circumstances; (4) a first-choice ranking among\nmany owners and managers who are contemplating sale of their businesses and (5) in a point related to the\npreceding item, a culture, distinctive in many ways from that of most large companies, that we have worked 50\nyears to develop and that is now rock-solid.\nThese strengths provide us a wonderful foundation on which to build.",

    "content": "The Next 50 Years at Berkshire\nNow let’s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge what\nwas coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what I\nwould say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire’s future.\n• First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshire\nshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That’s because our per-share\nintrinsic business value is almost certain to advance over time.\nThis cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor’s entry point into\nBerkshire stock is unusually high – at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shares\nhave occasionally reached – it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In other\nwords, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshire\nis not exempt from this truth.\nPurchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company\nwould repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire’s\ndirectors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our\nview, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)\nFor those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer no assurances,\nwhatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods will\nlikely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic value\nof your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: “In the short-term the market is a voting\nmachine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.” Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors –\namateurs and professionals alike – border on lunacy.\nSince I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire\nshares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should look\nelsewhere.\nAnother warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three\ntimes since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close to\nthis kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be a\nsatisfactory holding for investors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing\nleverage.\n• I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero.\nWe will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jackets\nto the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a “first responder” during the 2008-2009\nmeltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earnings\npotential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.\nFinancial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under all circumstances: (1) a large\nand reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) no significant near-term cash\nrequirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpected\nproblems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturing\nobligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindset\ncan be.\nHere’s how we will always stand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes from\na vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitive\nadvantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire’s\ncontinued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previously\nexperienced.",

    "content": "Next up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized – as an\nunproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business as\noxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.\nAmerican business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperous\ncompanies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, their\nfinancial oxygen disappeared.\nAt Berkshire, our “breathing” went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late September\nand early October, we supplied $15.6 billion of fresh money to American businesses.\nWe could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion – and usually far more – in cash\nequivalents. And by that we mean U. S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed to\ndeliver liquidity and actually do so, except when it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legal\ntender. Don’t leave home without it.\nFinally – getting to our third point – we will never engage in operating or investment practices that can\nresult in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debt\nmaturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require large\ncollateral calls.\nSome years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly\nmispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable.\nRecently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that ended\nour interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for some\nyears, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.\nMoreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option.\nMany life insurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a “run” in times of\nextreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. If\nour premium volume should shrink, our float would decline – but only at a very slow pace.\nThe reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely\npredictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Though\npractically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is always uncertain. (I felt no special apprehension\non December 6,1941 or September 10,2001.) And if you can’t predict what tomorrow will bring, you\nmust be prepared for whatever it does.\nA CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have\nonly a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be “right” 99% of the time. Those odds,\nhowever, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you’ve\nentrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it is\nmadness to risk losing what you need in pursuing what you simply desire.\n• Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning\npower of Berkshire. That does not mean operating earnings will increase each year – far from it. The U. S.\neconomy will ebb and flow – though mostly flow – and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. But\nwe will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe,\ntherefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlying earning power.\nIn some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition,\nand chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep moving\nforward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we will\npurchase. In most years, moreover, our country’s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business. We\nare blessed to have the United States as our home field.",

    "content": "• The bad news is that Berkshire’s long-term gains – measured by percentages, not by dollars – cannot be\ndramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years. The numbers have become too big.\nI think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t be\ngreat.\nEventually – probably between ten and twenty years from now – Berkshire’s earnings and capital resources\nwill reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company’s earnings. At\nthat time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings is\nthrough dividends, share repurchases or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value,\nmassive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directors\nwill make the right decision.\n• No company will be more shareholder-minded than Berkshire. For more than 30 years, we have annually\nreaffirmed our Shareholder Principles (see page 117), always leading off with: “Although our form is\ncorporate, our attitude is partnership.” This covenant with you is etched in stone.\nWe have an extraordinarily knowledgeable and business-oriented board of directors ready to carry out that\npromise of partnership. None took the job for the money: In an arrangement almost non-existent elsewhere,\nour directors are paid only token fees. They receive their rewards instead through ownership of Berkshire\nshares and the satisfaction that comes from being good stewards of an important enterprise.\nThe shares that they and their families own – which, in many cases, are worth very substantial sums – were\npurchased in the market (rather than their materializing through options or grants). In addition, unlike\nalmost all other sizable public companies, we carry no directors and officers liability insurance. At\nBerkshire, directors walk in your shoes.\nTo further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a nonexecutive Chairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should ever\nbe employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that this\nproblem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire – likely as low as at any public company. In my\nservice on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre\nCEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)\nIf elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of all\ndirectors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about the\nCEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors be\napprehensive, Howard’s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.\n• Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire board\nmeetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection and\nretention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires the\nreplacement of a subsidiary’s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire’s CEO to be a\nrational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights into\nhuman behavior. It’s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, “I’m no\ngenius, but I’m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.”)\nCharacter is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be “all in” for the company, not for himself. (I’m using male\npronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can’t help\nbut earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it’s important that neither ego nor avarice\nmotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements far\nexceed theirs. A CEO’s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it’s clear to them that\nshareholders’ interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way of\nthinking.",

    "content": "My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay,\nwhich are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the\nstrongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintain\nfriendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.\nIn their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U. S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Their\nstrengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them to\nfall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-time\nfinancial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.\nOnly a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger.\nHe must never forget Charlie’s plea: “Tell me where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.” If our noneconomic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire’s economic value would collapse as well. “Tone at the\ntop” will be key to maintaining Berkshire’s special culture.\nFortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinary\ndelegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense,\nBerkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we have\nnever had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many use\nthem as an important internal tool). We don’t have a legal office nor departments that other companies take\nfor granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.\nWe do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a damned fool. To an unusual degree,\nhowever, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, they\nwere doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore,\nour trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews and\nlayers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what we\nwould wish for, if the positions were reversed.\n• Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshire\nboard has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively\nyoung, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average well\nover ten years at the helm. (It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65\neither (or have you noticed?).\nIn both Berkshire’s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our\ncounterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire’s CEO. Developing confidence of\nthat sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.\nBoth the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready to\nassume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better\njob than I am doing.\n• Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists.\nThey will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to be\ncoordinated with Berkshire’s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investment\nmanagers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. Todd\nCombs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire’s investment team, are firstrate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.\nAll told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the right\npeople in place – the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture,\nfurthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, both\ngood and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners and\noperating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind\nand permanent home.",

    "content": "(viii) He would also spend much time in enthusiastically admiring what others were accomplishing.\n(7) New subsidiaries would usually be bought with cash, not newly issued stock.\n(8) Berkshire would not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders was\nbeing created by each dollar of retained earnings.\n(9) In buying a new subsidiary, Berkshire would seek to pay a fair price for a good business that the Chairman\ncould pretty well understand. Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for a\nlong time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters.\n(10) In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love for\nthe business and circumstances the CEO was in.\n(11) As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary.\n(12) Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary’s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary.\n(13) Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age.\n(14) Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthiness\nunder all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusual\nopportunities.\n(15) Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such a\nbusiness would get prompt attention. No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire would\never know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.\nBoth the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I\nknow of has half of such elements in place.\nHow did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?\nWell, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire’s shares and was completely trusted\nby all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshire\nsystem.\nAlmost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire’s\nachievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire’s\nsubsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while using\ndifferent systems.\nWhat was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?\nWell, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:\n(1) He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the most\nimportant people in the system, starting with himself.\n(2) He wanted win/win results everywhere--in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.\n(3) He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usually\nstayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.\n(4) He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy at\nheadquarters.\n(5) He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.\nWhen Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into\nsome benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.",

    "content": "Why did Berkshire under Buffett do so well?\nOnly four large factors occur to me:\n(1) The constructive peculiarities of Buffett,\n(2) The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,\n(3) Good luck, and\n(4) The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the\npress.\nI believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive\npeculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.\nIn particular, Buffett’s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to\nkeep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became good\nat tennis.\nBuffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won most\nregularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponents\nalways faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improved\nmore than was normal.\nAnd Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person,\nnot seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deteriorating\nlike the skill of a basketball player does.\nMoreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,\nBuffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs and\nthe achievements of the subsidiaries.\nThen, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and\nBerkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries into\nBerkshire, and better CEOs as well.\nAnd the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a\n“virtuous circle.”\nHow well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?\nMarvelously well. Berkshire’s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.\nCasualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders’ equity, as\ndid Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during the\nlast 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.\nAnd, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries greatly\noutperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire’s\nstockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance\n(perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurance\nbusiness that produced both a huge “float” and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire,\nfollowed by a quadrupling of GEICO’s market share. And the rest of Berkshire’s insurance operations hugely\nimproved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches,\nand recruiting and holding outstanding people.",

    "content": "Then, later, as Berkshire’s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became well\nknown, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buy\nprivately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.\nBerkshire’s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is a\nproducer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire’s better\noutcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a small\nbase while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.\nDid Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widened\narea for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett’s skills.\nWhy did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything in\nexchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.\nWhy did Berkshire’s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshire\nshareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?\nWell, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the\nequivalent of a “department of acquisitions” under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from “helpers”\nsure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertise\nwhile he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn’t in business, aided by his long\nexperience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than most\nothers, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten years\nin control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, for\na net gain of one.\nWhat were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common,\nalmost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure to\nwork out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire’s net worth would now be at\nleast $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtually\nsure things.\nThe next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffett\nwere soon to depart.\nThe answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable\ncompetitive advantage.\nMoreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new\nfixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise “bolt-on” acquisitions.\nProvided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now present\nis so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if\n(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never again\npurchased a large business.\nBut, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be “of only moderate ability.” For\ninstance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as “world-class.”\n“World-leading” would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better business\nexecutive than Buffett.\nAnd I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire\nmuch change in the Berkshire system.",

With Berkshire now\nso large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and that\nBerkshire’s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.\nMy final task was to consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may\nprove useful elsewhere.\nThe answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a large\nand useful company. And it solved that problem by avoiding bureaucracy and relying much on one thoughtful leader\nfor a long, long time as he kept improving and brought in more people like himself.\nCompare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession of\nCEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixed\nretirement age.\nI believe that versions of the Berkshire system should be tried more often elsewhere and that the worst attributes of\nbureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble. A good example of\nbureaucracy fixing was created by George Marshall when he helped win World War II by getting from Congress the\nright to ignore seniority in choosing generals.\nSincerely,\nCharles T.
