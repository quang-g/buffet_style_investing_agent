    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 2004 was $8.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 10.5%. Over the last 40 years (that is, since present management\ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $55,824, a rate of 21.9% compounded annually.*\nIt’s per-share intrinsic value that counts, however, not book value. Here, the news is good:\nBetween 1964 and 2004, Berkshire morphed from a struggling northern textile business whose intrinsic\nvalue was less than book into a diversified enterprise worth far more than book. Our 40-year gain in\nintrinsic value has therefore somewhat exceeded our 21.9% gain in book. (For an explanation of intrinsic\nvalue and the economic principles that guide Charlie Munger, my partner and Berkshire’s vice-chairman,\nand me in running Berkshire, please read our Owner’s Manual, beginning on page 73.)\nDespite their shortcomings, yearly calculations of book value are useful at Berkshire as a slightly\nunderstated gauge for measuring the long-term rate of increase in our intrinsic value. The calculations are\nless relevant, however, than they once were in rating any single year’s performance versus the S&P 500\nindex (a comparison we display on the facing page). Our equity holdings (including convertible preferreds)\nhave fallen considerably as a percentage of our net worth, from an average of 114% in the 1980 s, for\nexample, to less than 50% in recent years. Therefore, yearly movements in the stock market now affect a\nmuch smaller portion of our net worth than was once the case, a fact that will normally cause us to\nunderperform in years when stocks rise substantially and overperform in years when they fall.\nHowever the yearly comparisons work out, Berkshire’s long-term performance versus the S&P\nremains all-important. Our shareholders can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost. Unless\nwe achieve gains in per-share intrinsic value in the future that outdo the S&P, Charlie and I will be adding\nnothing to what you can accomplish on your own.\nLast year, Berkshire’s book-value gain of 10.5% fell short of the index’s 10.9% return. Our\nlackluster performance was not due to any stumbles by the CEOs of our operating businesses: As always,\nthey pulled more than their share of the load. My message to them is simple: Run your business as if it\nwere the only asset your family will own over the next hundred years. Almost invariably they do just that\nand, after taking care of the needs of their business, send excess cash to Omaha for me to deploy.\nI didn’t do that job very well last year. My hope was to make several multi-billion dollar\nacquisitions that would add new and significant streams of earnings to the many we already have. But I\nstruck out. Additionally, I found very few attractive securities to buy. Berkshire therefore ended the year\nwith $43 billion of cash equivalents, not a happy position. Charlie and I will work to translate some of this\nhoard into more interesting assets during 2005, though we can’t promise success.\nIn one respect, 2004 was a remarkable year for the stock market, a fact buried in the maze of\nnumbers on page 2. If you examine the 35 years since the 1960 s ended, you will find that an investor’s\nreturn, including dividends, from owning the S&P has averaged 11.2% annually (well above what we\nexpect future returns to be). But if you look for years with returns anywhere close to that 11.2% – say,\nbetween 8% and 14% – you will find only one before 2004. In other words, last year’s “normal” return is\nanything but.\n*All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares, the successor to the only stock that\nthe company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30 th that of\nthe A.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nOver the 35 years, American business has delivered terrific results. It should therefore have been\neasy for investors to earn juicy returns: All they had to do was piggyback Corporate America in a\ndiversified, low-expense way. An index fund that they never touched would have done the job. Instead\nmany investors have had experiences ranging from mediocre to disastrous.\nThere have been three primary causes: first, high costs, usually because investors traded\nexcessively or spent far too much on investment management; second, portfolio decisions based on tips and\nfads rather than on thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses; and third, a start-and-stop approach to\nthe market marked by untimely entries (after an advance has been long underway) and exits (after periods\nof stagnation or decline). Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies. And\nif they insist on trying to time their participation in equities, they should try to be fearful when others are\ngreedy and greedy only when others are fearful.",

    "content": "Sector Results\nAs managers, Charlie and I want to give our owners the financial information and commentary we\nwould wish to receive if our roles were reversed. To do this with both clarity and reasonable brevity\nbecomes more difficult as Berkshire’s scope widens. Some of our businesses have vastly different\neconomic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated statements, with their jumble of\nfigures, make useful analysis almost impossible.\nOn the following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earnings figures from\nour four major categories of businesses along with commentary about each. We particularly want you to\nunderstand the limited circumstances under which we will use debt, given that we typically shun it. We\nwill not, however, inundate you with data that has no real value in estimating Berkshire’s intrinsic value.\nDoing so would tend to obfuscate the facts that count.\n\nRegulated Utility Businesses\nWe have an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in Mid American Energy Holdings, which owns a wide\nvariety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose\n3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U. K.; (2)\nMid American Energy, which serves 698,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; and (3) Kern River and\nNorthern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.9% of the natural gas consumed in the U. S.\nThe remaining 19.5% of Mid American is owned by three partners of ours: Dave Sokol and Greg\nAbel, the brilliant managers of these businesses, and Walter Scott, a long-time friend of mine who\nintroduced me to the company. Because Mid American is subject to the Public Utility Holding Company\nAct (“PUHCA”), Berkshire’s voting interest is limited to 9.9%. Voting control rests with Walter.\nOur limited voting interest forces us to account for Mid American in an abbreviated manner.\nInstead of our fully incorporating the company’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into Berkshire’s\nstatements, we make one-line entries only in both our balance sheet and income account. It’s likely,\nthough, that PUHCA will someday – perhaps soon – be repealed or that accounting rules will change.\nBerkshire’s consolidated figures would then incorporate all of Mid American, including the substantial debt\nit utilizes (though this debt is not now, nor will it ever be, an obligation of Berkshire).\nAt yearend, $1.478 billion of Mid American’s junior debt was payable to Berkshire. This debt has\nallowed acquisitions to be financed without our partners needing to increase their already substantial\ninvestments in Mid American. By charging 11% interest, Berkshire is compensated fairly for putting up the\nfunds needed for purchases, while our partners are spared dilution of their equity interests. Because\nMid American made no large acquisitions last year, it paid down $100 million of what it owes us.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nMid American also owns a significant non-utility business, Home Services of America, the second\nlargest real estate broker in the country. Unlike our utility operations, this business is highly cyclical, but\nnevertheless one we view enthusiastically. We have an exceptional manager, Ron Peltier, who through\nboth his acquisition and operational skills is building a brokerage powerhouse.\nHome Services participated in $59.8 billion of transactions in 2004, a gain of $11.2 billion from\n2003. About 24% of the increase came from six acquisitions made during the year. Through our 17\nbrokerage firms – all of which retain their local identities – we employ more than 18,000 brokers in 18\nstates. Home Services is almost certain to grow substantially in the next decade as we continue to acquire\nleading localized operations.\nLast year Mid American wrote off a major investment in a zinc recovery project that was initiated\nin 1998 and became operational in 2002. Large quantities of zinc are present in the brine produced by our\nCalifornia geothermal operations, and we believed we could profitably extract the metal. For many\nmonths, it appeared that commercially-viable recoveries were imminent. But in mining, just as in oil\nexploration, prospects have a way of “teasing” their developers, and every time one problem was solved,\nanother popped up. In September, we threw in the towel.\n\nOur failure here illustrates the importance of a guideline – stay with simple propositions – that we\nusually apply in investments as well as operations. If only one variable is key to a decision, and the\nvariable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chance for a successful outcome is obviously 90%. But\nif ten independent variables need to break favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% probability\nof success, the likelihood of having a winner is only 35%. In our zinc venture, we solved most of the\nproblems. But one proved intractable, and that was one too many. Since a chain is no stronger than its\nweakest link, it makes sense to look for – if you’ll excuse an oxymoron – mono-linked chains.\nA breakdown of Mid American’s results follows. In 2004, the “other” category includes a $72.2\nmillion profit from sale of an Enron receivable that was thrown in when we purchased Northern Natural\ntwo years earlier. Walter, Dave and I, as natives of Omaha, view this unanticipated gain as war reparations\n• partial compensation for the loss our city suffered in 1986 when Ken Lay moved Northern to Houston,\nafter promising to leave the company here.

    "content": "Insurance\nSince Berkshire purchased National Indemnity (“NICO”) in 1967, property-casualty insurance has\nbeen our core business and the propellant of our growth. Insurance has provided a fountain of funds with\nwhich we’ve acquired the securities and businesses that now give us an ever-widening variety of earnings\nstreams. So in this section, I will be spending a little time telling you how we got where we are.\nThe source of our insurance funds is “float,” which is money that doesn’t belong to us but that we\ntemporarily hold. Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are paid upfront though the service we\nprovide – insurance protection – is delivered over a period that usually covers a year and; (2) loss events\nthat occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims, because it sometimes takes many\nyears for losses to be reported (asbestos losses would be an example), negotiated and settled. The $20\nmillion of float that came with our 1967 purchase has now increased – both by way of internal growth and\nacquisitions – to $46.1 billion.\nFloat is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price. Its cost is determined by underwriting\nresults, meaning how the expenses and losses we will ultimately pay compare with the premiums we have\nreceived. When an underwriting profit is achieved – as has been the case at Berkshire in about half of the\n38 years we have been in the insurance business – float is better than free. In such years, we are actually\npaid for holding other people’s money. For most insurers, however, life has been far more difficult: In\naggregate, the property-casualty industry almost invariably operates at an underwriting loss. When that\nloss is large, float becomes expensive, sometimes devastatingly so.\nInsurers have generally earned poor returns for a simple reason: They sell a commodity-like\nproduct. Policy forms are standard, and the product is available from many suppliers, some of whom are\nmutual companies (“owned” by policyholders rather than stockholders) with profit goals that are limited.\nMoreover, most insureds don’t care from whom they buy. Customers by the millions say “I need some\nGillette blades” or “I’ll have a Coke” but we wait in vain for “I’d like a National Indemnity policy, please.”\nConsequently, price competition in insurance is usually fierce. Think airline seats.\nSo, you may ask, how do Berkshire’s insurance operations overcome the dismal economics of the\nindustry and achieve some measure of enduring competitive advantage? We’ve attacked that problem in\nseveral ways. Let’s look first at NICO’s strategy.\nWhen we purchased the company – a specialist in commercial auto and general liability insurance\n• it did not appear to have any attributes that would overcome the industry’s chronic troubles. It was not\nwell-known, had no informational advantage (the company has never had an actuary), was not a low-cost\noperator, and sold through general agents, a method many people thought outdated. Nevertheless, for\nalmost all of the past 38 years, NICO has been a star performer. Indeed, had we not made this acquisition,\nBerkshire would be lucky to be worth half of what it is today.\nWhat we’ve had going for us is a managerial mindset that most insurers find impossible to\nreplicate. Take a look at the facing page. Can you imagine any public company embracing a business\nmodel that would lead to the decline in revenue that we experienced from 1986 through 1999? That\ncolossal slide, it should be emphasized, did not occur because business was unobtainable. Many billions of\npremium dollars were readily available to NICO had we only been willing to cut prices. But we instead\nconsistently priced to make a profit, not to match our most optimistic competitor. We never left customers\n• but they left us.\nMost American businesses harbor an “institutional imperative” that rejects extended decreases in\nvolume. What CEO wants to report to his shareholders that not only did business contract last year but that\nit will continue to drop? In insurance, the urge to keep writing business is also intensified because the\nconsequences of foolishly-priced policies may not become apparent for some time. If an insurer is\noptimistic in its reserving, reported earnings will be overstated, and years may pass before true loss costs\nare revealed (a form of self-deception that nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 1970 s).\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Finally, there is a fear factor at work, in that a shrinking business usually leads to layoffs. To\navoid pink slips, employees will rationalize inadequate pricing, telling themselves that poorly-priced\nbusiness must be tolerated in order to keep the organization intact and the distribution system happy. If this\ncourse isn’t followed, these employees will argue, the company will not participate in the recovery that\nthey invariably feel is just around the corner.\nTo combat employees’ natural tendency to save their own skins, we have always promised\nNICO’s workforce that no one will be fired because of declining volume, however severe the contraction.\n(This is not Donald Trump’s sort of place.) NICO is not labor-intensive, and, as the table suggests, can live\nwith excess overhead. It can’t live, however, with underpriced business and the breakdown in underwriting\ndiscipline that accompanies it. An insurance organization that doesn’t care deeply about underwriting at a\nprofit this year is unlikely to care next year either.\nNaturally, a business that follows a no-layoff policy must be especially careful to avoid\noverstaffing when times are good. Thirty years ago Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities, drove this point\nhome to me with a hypothetical tale about an employee who asked his boss for permission to hire an\nassistant. The employee assumed that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential. But\nhis boss told him the proposal should be evaluated as a $3 million decision, given that an additional person\nwould probably cost at least that amount over his lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits and other expenses\n(more people, more toilet paper). And unless the company fell on very hard times, the employee added\nwould be unlikely to be dismissed, however marginal his contribution to the business.\nIt takes real fortitude – embedded deep within a company’s culture – to operate as NICO does.\nAnyone examining the table can scan the years from 1986 to 1999 quickly. But living day after day with\ndwindling volume – while competitors are boasting of growth and reaping Wall Street’s applause – is an\nexperience few managers can tolerate. NICO, however, has had four CEOs since its formation in 1940 and\nnone have bent. (It should be noted that only one of the four graduated from college. Our experience tells\nus that extraordinary business ability is largely innate.)\nThe current managerial star – make that superstar – at NICO is Don Wurster (yes, he’s “the\ngraduate”), who has been running things since 1989. His slugging percentage is right up there with Barry\nBonds’ because, like Barry, Don will accept a walk rather than swing at a bad pitch. Don has now amassed\n$950 million of float at NICO that over time is almost certain to be proved the negative-cost kind. Because\ninsurance prices are falling, Don’s volume will soon decline very significantly and, as it does, Charlie and I\nwill applaud him ever more loudly.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnother way to prosper in a commodity-type business is to be the low-cost operator. Among auto\ninsurers operating on a broad scale, GEICO holds that cherished title. For NICO, as we have seen, an ebband-flow business model makes sense. But a company holding a low-cost advantage must pursue an\nunrelenting foot-to-the-floor strategy. And that’s just what we do at GEICO.\nA century ago, when autos first appeared, the property-casualty industry operated as a cartel. The\nmajor companies, most of which were based in the Northeast, established “bureau” rates and that was it.\nNo one cut prices to attract business. Instead, insurers competed for strong, well-regarded agents, a focus\nthat produced high commissions for agents and high prices for consumers.\nIn 1922, State Farm was formed by George Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, who aimed to\ntake advantage of the pricing umbrella maintained by the high-cost giants of the industry. State Farm\nemployed a “captive” agency force, a system keeping its acquisition costs lower than those incurred by the\nbureau insurers (whose “independent” agents successfully played off one company against another). With\nits low-cost structure, State Farm eventually captured about 25% of the personal lines (auto and\nhomeowners) business, far outdistancing its once-mighty competitors. Allstate, formed in 1931, put a\nsimilar distribution system into place and soon became the runner-up in personal lines to State Farm.\nCapitalism had worked its magic, and these low-cost operations looked unstoppable.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "But a man named Leo Goodwin had an idea for an even more efficient auto insurer and, with a\nskimpy $200,000, started GEICO in 1936. Goodwin’s plan was to eliminate the agent entirely and to deal\ninstead directly with the auto owner. Why, he asked himself, should there be any unnecessary and\nexpensive links in the distribution mechanism when the product, auto insurance, was both mandatory and\ncostly. Purchasers of business insurance, he reasoned, might well require professional advice, but most\nconsumers knew what they needed in an auto policy. That was a powerful insight.\nOriginally, GEICO mailed its low-cost message to a limited audience of government employees.\nLater, it widened its horizons and shifted its marketing emphasis to the phone, working inquiries that came\nfrom broadcast and print advertising. And today the Internet is coming on strong.\nBetween 1936 and 1975, GEICO grew from a standing start to a 4% market share, becoming the\ncountry’s fourth largest auto insurer. During most of this period, the company was superbly managed,\nachieving both excellent volume gains and high profits. It looked unstoppable. But after my friend and\nhero Lorimer Davidson retired as CEO in 1970, his successors soon made a huge mistake by underreserving for losses. This produced faulty cost information, which in turn produced inadequate pricing. By\n1976, GEICO was on the brink of failure.\nJack Byrne then joined GEICO as CEO and, almost single-handedly, saved the company by heroic\nefforts that included major price increases. Though GEICO’s survival required these, policyholders fled\nthe company, and by 1980 its market share had fallen to 1.8%. Subsequently, the company embarked on\nsome unwise diversification moves. This shift of emphasis away from its extraordinary core business\nstunted GEICO’s growth, and by 1993 its market share had grown only fractionally, to 1.9%. Then Tony\nNicely took charge.\nAnd what a difference that’s made: In 2005 GEICO will probably secure a 6% market share.\nBetter yet, Tony has matched growth with profitability. Indeed, GEICO delivers all of its constituents\nmajor benefits: In 2004 its customers saved $1 billion or so compared to what they would otherwise have\npaid for coverage, its associates earned a $191 million profit-sharing bonus that averaged 24.3% of salary,\nand its owner – that’s us – enjoyed excellent financial returns.\nThere’s more good news. When Jack Byrne was rescuing the company in 1976, New Jersey\nrefused to grant him the rates he needed to operate profitably. He therefore promptly – and properly –\nwithdrew from the state. Subsequently, GEICO avoided both New Jersey and Massachusetts, recognizing\nthem as two jurisdictions in which insurers were destined to struggle.\nIn 2003, however, New Jersey took a new look at its chronic auto-insurance problems and enacted\nlegislation that would curb fraud and allow insurers a fair playing field. Even so, one might have expected\nthe state’s bureaucracy to make change slow and difficult.\nBut just the opposite occurred. Holly Bakke, the New Jersey insurance commissioner, who would\nbe a success in any line of work, was determined to turn the law’s intent into reality. With her staff’s\ncooperation, GEICO ironed out the details for re-entering the state and was licensed last August. Since\nthen, we’ve received a response from New Jersey drivers that is multiples of my expectations.\nWe are now serving 140,000 policyholders – about 4% of the New Jersey market – and saving\nthem substantial sums (as we do drivers everywhere). Word-of-mouth recommendations within the state\nare causing inquiries to pour in. And once we hear from a New Jersey prospect, our closure rate – the\npercentage of policies issued to inquiries received – is far higher in the state than it is nationally.\nWe make no claim, of course, that we can save everyone money. Some companies, using rating\nsystems that are different from ours, will offer certain classes of drivers a lower rate than we do. But we\nbelieve GEICO offers the lowest price more often than any other national company that serves all segments\nof the public. In addition, in most states, including New Jersey, Berkshire shareholders receive an 8%\ndiscount. So gamble fifteen minutes of your time and go to GEICO. com – or call 800-847-7536 – to see\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "whether you can save big money (which you might want to use, of course, to buy other Berkshire\nproducts).\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nReinsurance – insurance sold to other insurers who wish to lay off part of the risks they have\nassumed – should not be a commodity product. At bottom, any insurance policy is simply a promise, and\nas everyone knows, promises vary enormously in their quality.\nAt the primary insurance level, nevertheless, just who makes the promise is often of minor\nimportance. In personal-lines insurance, for example, states levy assessments on solvent companies to pay\nthe policyholders of companies that go broke. In the business-insurance field, the same arrangement\napplies to workers’ compensation policies. “Protected” policies of these types account for about 60% of\nthe property-casualty industry’s volume. Prudently-run insurers are irritated by the need to subsidize poor\nor reckless management elsewhere, but that’s the way it is.\nOther forms of business insurance at the primary level involve promises that carry greater risks for\nthe insured. When Reliance Insurance and Home Insurance were run into the ground, for example, their\npromises proved to be worthless. Consequently, many holders of their business policies (other than those\ncovering workers’ compensation) suffered painful losses.\nThe solvency risk in primary policies, however, pales in comparison to that lurking in reinsurance\npolicies. When a reinsurer goes broke, staggering losses almost always strike the primary companies it has\ndealt with. This risk is far from minor: GEICO has suffered tens of millions in losses from its careless\nselection of reinsurers in the early 1980 s.\nWere a true mega-catastrophe to occur in the next decade or two – and that’s a real possibility –\nsome reinsurers would not survive. The largest insured loss to date is the World Trade Center disaster,\nwhich cost the insurance industry an estimated $35 billion. Hurricane Andrew cost insurers about $15.5\nbillion in 1992 (though that loss would be far higher in today’s dollars). Both events rocked the insurance\nand reinsurance world. But a $100 billion event, or even a larger catastrophe, remains a possibility if either\na particularly severe earthquake or hurricane hits just the wrong place. Four significant hurricanes struck\nFlorida during 2004, causing an aggregate of $25 billion or so in insured losses. Two of these – Charley\nand Ivan – could have done at least three times the damage they did had they entered the U. S. not far from\ntheir actual landing points.\nMany insurers regard a $100 billion industry loss as “unthinkable” and won’t even plan for it. But\nat Berkshire, we are fully prepared. Our share of the loss would probably be 3% to 5%, and earnings from\nour investments and other businesses would comfortably exceed that cost. When “the day after” arrives,\nBerkshire’s checks will clear.\nThough the hurricanes hit us with a $1.25 billion loss, our reinsurance operations did well last\nyear. At General Re, Joe Brandon has restored a long-admired culture of underwriting discipline that, for a\ntime, had lost its way. The excellent results he realized in 2004 on current business, however, were offset\nby adverse developments from the years before he took the helm. At NICO’s reinsurance operation, Ajit\nJain continues to successfully underwrite huge risks that no other reinsurer is willing or able to accept.\nAjit’s value to Berkshire is enormous.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur insurance managers, maximizing the competitive strengths I’ve mentioned in this section,\nagain delivered first-class underwriting results last year. As a consequence, our float was better than\ncostless.

In this report, we’ll skip over\nseveral that are now of lesser importance: Berkadia is down to tag ends; Value Capital has added other\ninvestors, negating our expectation that we would need to consolidate its financials into ours; and the\ntrading operation that I run continues to shrink.\n• Both of Berkshire’s leasing operations rebounded last year. At CORT (office furniture), earnings\nremain inadequate, but are trending upward. XTRA disposed of its container and intermodal\nbusinesses in order to concentrate on trailer leasing, long its strong suit. Overhead has been\nreduced, asset utilization is up and decent profits are now being achieved under Bill Franz, the\ncompany’s new CEO.\n• The wind-down of Gen Re Securities continues. We decided to exit this derivative operation three\nyears ago, but getting out is easier said than done. Though derivative instruments are purported to\nbe highly liquid – and though we have had the benefit of a benign market while liquidating ours –\nwe still had 2,890 contracts outstanding at yearend, down from 23,218 at the peak. Like Hell,\nderivative trading is easy to enter but difficult to leave. (Other similarities come to mind as well.)\nGen Re’s derivative contracts have always been required to be marked to market, and I believe the\ncompany’s management conscientiously tried to make realistic “marks.” The market prices of\nderivatives, however, can be very fuzzy in a world in which settlement of a transaction is\nsometimes decades away and often involves multiple variables as well. In the interim the marks\ninfluence the managerial and trading bonuses that are paid annually. It’s small wonder that\nphantom profits are often recorded.\nInvestors should understand that in all types of financial institutions, rapid growth sometimes\nmasks major underlying problems (and occasionally fraud). The real test of the earning power of\na derivatives operation is what it achieves after operating for an extended period in a no-growth\nmode. You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out.\n• After 40 years, we’ve finally generated a little synergy at Berkshire: Clayton Homes is doing well\nand that’s in part due to its association with Berkshire.

Volume in these years was the lowest since\n1962, and it was also only about 40% of annual sales during the years 1995-99. That era,\ncharacterized by irresponsible financing and naïve funders, was a fool’s paradise for the industry.\nBecause one major lender after another has fled the field, financing continues to bedevil\nmanufacturers, retailers and purchasers of manufactured homes. Here Berkshire’s support has\nproven valuable to Clayton. We stand ready to fund whatever makes sense, and last year\nClayton’s management found much that qualified.\nAs we explained in our 2003 report, we believe in using borrowed money to support profitable,\ninterest-bearing receivables. At the beginning of last year, we had borrowed $2 billion to relend to\nClayton (at a one percentage-point markup) and by January 2005 the total was $7.35 billion. Most\nof the dollars added were borrowed by us on January 4,2005, to finance a seasoned portfolio that\nClayton purchased on December 30,2004 from a bank exiting the business.\nWe now have two additional portfolio purchases in the works, totaling about $1.6 billion, but it’s\nquite unlikely that we will secure others of any significance. Therefore, Clayton’s receivables (in\nwhich originations will roughly offset payoffs) will probably hover around $9 billion for some\ntime and should deliver steady earnings. This pattern will be far different from that of the past, in\nwhich Clayton, like all major players in its industry, “securitized” its receivables, causing earnings\nto be front-ended. In the last two years, the securitization market has dried up. The limited funds\navailable today come only at higher cost and with harsh terms. Had Clayton remained\nindependent in this period, it would have had mediocre earnings as it struggled with financing.\nIn April, Clayton completed the acquisition of Oakwood Homes and is now the industry’s largest\nproducer and retailer of manufactured homes. We love putting more assets in the hands of Kevin\nClayton, the company’s CEO. He is a prototype Berkshire manager. Today, Clayton has 11,837\nemployees, up from 7,136 when we purchased it, and Charlie and I are pleased that Berkshire has\nbeen useful in facilitating this growth.\nFor simplicity’s sake, we include all of Clayton’s earnings in this sector, though a sizable portion\nof these are derived from areas other than consumer finance.\n(in $ millions)\nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities\n2004 2003 2004 2003\nTrading – ordinary income............................ $ 264 $ 355 $5,751 $7,826\nGen Re Securities...........................................

Volume in these years was the lowest since\n1962, and it was also only about 40% of annual sales during the years 1995-99. That era,\ncharacterized by irresponsible financing and naïve funders, was a fool’s paradise for the industry.\nBecause one major lender after another has fled the field, financing continues to bedevil\nmanufacturers, retailers and purchasers of manufactured homes. Here Berkshire’s support has\nproven valuable to Clayton. We stand ready to fund whatever makes sense, and last year\nClayton’s management found much that qualified.\nAs we explained in our 2003 report, we believe in using borrowed money to support profitable,\ninterest-bearing receivables. At the beginning of last year, we had borrowed $2 billion to relend to\nClayton (at a one percentage-point markup) and by January 2005 the total was $7.35 billion. Most\nof the dollars added were borrowed by us on January 4,2005, to finance a seasoned portfolio that\nClayton purchased on December 30,2004 from a bank exiting the business.\nWe now have two additional portfolio purchases in the works, totaling about $1.6 billion, but it’s\nquite unlikely that we will secure others of any significance. Therefore, Clayton’s receivables (in\nwhich originations will roughly offset payoffs) will probably hover around $9 billion for some\ntime and should deliver steady earnings. This pattern will be far different from that of the past, in\nwhich Clayton, like all major players in its industry, “securitized” its receivables, causing earnings\nto be front-ended. In the last two years, the securitization market has dried up. The limited funds\navailable today come only at higher cost and with harsh terms. Had Clayton remained\nindependent in this period, it would have had mediocre earnings as it struggled with financing.\nIn April, Clayton completed the acquisition of Oakwood Homes and is now the industry’s largest\nproducer and retailer of manufactured homes. We love putting more assets in the hands of Kevin\nClayton, the company’s CEO. He is a prototype Berkshire manager. Today, Clayton has 11,837\nemployees, up from 7,136 when we purchased it, and Charlie and I are pleased that Berkshire has\nbeen useful in facilitating this growth.\nFor simplicity’s sake, we include all of Clayton’s earnings in this sector, though a sizable portion\nof these are derived from areas other than consumer finance.\n(in $ millions)\nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities\n2004 2003 2004 2003\nTrading – ordinary income............................ $ 264 $ 355 $5,751 $7,826\nGen Re Securities...........................................

    "content": "Since we purchased Mi Tek in 2001, Gene Toombs, its CEO, has made some brilliant “bolt-on”\nacquisitions and is on his way to creating a mini-Berkshire.\nShaw fielded a barrage of price increases in its main fiber materials during the year, a hit that added\nmore than $300 million to its costs. (When you walk on carpet you are, in effect, stepping on\nprocessed oil.) Though we followed these hikes in costs with price increases of our own, there was an\ninevitable lag. Therefore, margins narrowed as the year progressed and remain under pressure today.\nDespite these roadblocks, Shaw, led by Bob Shaw and Julian Saul, earned an outstanding 25.6% on\ntangible equity in 2004. The company is a powerhouse and has a bright future.\n• In apparel, Fruit of the Loom increased unit sales by 10 million dozen, or 14%, with shipments of\nintimate apparel for women and girls growing by 31%. Charlie, who is far more knowledgeable than I\nam on this subject, assures me that women are not wearing more underwear. With this expert input, I\ncan only conclude that our market share in the women’s category must be growing rapidly. Thanks to\nJohn Holland, Fruit is on the move.\nA smaller operation, Garan, also had an excellent year. Led by Seymour Lichtenstein and Jerry\nKamiel, this company manufactures the popular Garanimals line for children. Next time you are in a\nWal-Mart, check out this imaginative product.\n• Among our retailers, Ben Bridge (jewelry) and R. C. Willey (home furnishings) were particular\nstandouts last year.\nAt Ben Bridge same-store sales grew 11.4%, the best gain among the publicly-held jewelers whose\nreports I have seen. Additionally, the company’s profit margin widened. Last year was not a fluke:\nDuring the past decade, the same-store sales gains of the company have averaged 8.8%.\nEd and Jon Bridge are fourth-generation managers and run the business exactly as if it were their own\n• which it is in every respect except for Berkshire’s name on the stock certificates. The Bridges have\nexpanded successfully by securing the right locations and, more importantly, by staffing these stores\nwith enthusiastic and knowledgeable associates. We will move into Minneapolis-St. Paul this year.\nAt Utah-based R. C. Willey, the gains from expansion have been even more dramatic, with 41.9% of\n2004 sales coming from out-of-state stores that didn’t exist before 1999. The company also improved\nits profit margin in 2004, propelled by its two new stores in Las Vegas.\nI would like to tell you that these stores were my idea. In truth, I thought they were mistakes. I knew,\nof course, how brilliantly Bill Child had run the R. C. Willey operation in Utah, where its market share\nhad long been huge. But I felt our closed-on-Sunday policy would prove disastrous away from home.\nEven our first out-of-state store in Boise, which was highly successful, left me unconvinced. I kept\nasking whether Las Vegas residents, conditioned to seven-day-a-week retailers, would adjust to us.\nOur first Las Vegas store, opened in 2001, answered this question in a resounding manner,\nimmediately becoming our number one unit.\nBill and Scott Hymas, his successor as CEO, then proposed a second Las Vegas store, only about 20\nminutes away. I felt this expansion would cannibalize the first unit, adding significant costs but only\nmodest sales. The result? Each store is now doing about 26% more volume than any other store in the\nchain and is consistently showing large year-over-year gains.\nR. C. Willey will soon open in Reno. Before making this commitment, Bill and Scott again asked for\nmy advice. Initially, I was pretty puffed up about the fact that they were consulting me. But then it\ndawned on me that the opinion of someone who is always wrong has its own special utility to decisionmakers.",

    "content": "[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n• Earnings improved in flight services. At Flight Safety, the world’s leader in pilot training, profits rose\nas corporate aviation rebounded and our business with regional airlines increased. We now operate\n283 simulators with an original cost of $1.2 billion. Pilots are trained one at a time on this expensive\nequipment. This means that as much as $3.50 of capital investment is required to produce $1 of annual\nrevenue. With this level of capital intensity, Flight Safety requires very high operating margins in order\nto obtain reasonable returns on capital, which means that utilization rates are all-important. Last year,\nFlight Safety’s return on tangible equity improved to 15.1% from 8.4% in 2003.\nIn another 2004 event, Al Ueltschi, who founded Flight Safety in 1951 with $10,000, turned over the\nCEO position to Bruce Whitman, a 43-year veteran at the company. (But Al’s not going anywhere; I\nwon’t let him.) Bruce shares Al’s conviction that flying an aircraft is a privilege to be extended only to\npeople who regularly receive the highest quality of training and are undeniably competent. A few\nyears ago, Charlie was asked to intervene with Al on behalf of a tycoon friend whom Flight Safety had\nflunked. Al’s reply to Charlie: “Tell your pal he belongs in the back of the plane, not the cockpit.”\nFlight Safety’s number one customer is Net Jets, our aircraft fractional-ownership subsidiary. Its 2,100\npilots spend an average of 18 days a year in training. Additionally, these pilots fly only one aircraft\ntype whereas many flight operations juggle pilots among several types. Net Jets’ high standards on\nboth fronts are two of the reasons I signed up with the company years before Berkshire bought it.\nFully as important in my decisions to both use and buy Net Jets, however, was the fact that the\ncompany was managed by Rich Santulli, the creator of the fractional-ownership industry and a fanatic\nabout safety and service. I viewed the selection of a flight provider as akin to picking a brain surgeon:\nyou simply want the best. (Let someone else experiment with the low bidder.)\nLast year Net Jets again gained about 70% of the net new business (measured by dollar value) going to\nthe four companies that dominate the industry. A portion of our growth came from the 25-hour card\noffered by Marquis Jet Partners. Marquis is not owned by Net Jets, but is instead a customer that\nrepackages the purchases it makes from us into smaller packages that it sells through its card. Marquis\ndeals exclusively with Net Jets, utilizing the power of our reputation in its marketing.\nOur U. S. contracts, including Marquis customers, grew from 3,877 to 4,967 in 2004 (versus\napproximately 1,200 contracts when Berkshire bought Net Jets in 1998). Some clients (including me)\nenter into multiple contracts because they wish to use more than one type of aircraft, selecting for any\ngiven trip whichever type best fits the mission at hand.\nNet Jets earned a modest amount in the U. S. last year. But what we earned domestically was largely\noffset by losses in Europe. We are now, however, generating real momentum abroad. Contracts\n(including 25-hour cards that we ourselves market in Europe) increased from 364 to 693 during the\nyear. We will again have a very significant European loss in 2005, but domestic earnings will likely\nput us in the black overall.\nEurope has been expensive for Net Jets – far more expensive than I anticipated – but it is essential to\nbuilding a flight operation that will forever be in a class by itself. Our U. S. owners already want a\nquality service wherever they travel and their wish for flight hours abroad is certain to grow\ndramatically in the decades ahead. Last year, U. S. owners made 2,003 flights in Europe, up 22% from\nthe previous year and 137% from 2000. Just as important, our European owners made 1,067 flights in\nthe U. S., up 65% from 2003 and 239% from 2000.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

By yearend 2004, therefore, we had held these\n“business interests,” on a weighted basis, about 12½ years.\nIn 2004, Berkshire’s share of the group’s earnings amounted to $1.2 billion. These earnings might\nlegitimately be considered “normal.” True, they were swelled because Gillette and Wells Fargo omitted\noption costs in their presentation of earnings; but on the other hand they were reduced because Coke had a\nnon-recurring write-off.\nOur share of the earnings of these four companies has grown almost every year, and now amounts\nto about 31.3% of our cost. Their cash distributions to us have also grown consistently, totaling $434\nmillion in 2004, or about 11.3% of cost. All in all, the Big Four have delivered us a satisfactory, though far\nfrom spectacular, business result.\nThat’s true as well of our experience in the market with the group. Since our original purchases,\nvaluation gains have somewhat exceeded earnings growth because price/earnings ratios have increased. On\na year-to-year basis, however, the business and market performances have often diverged, sometimes to an\nextraordinary degree. During The Great Bubble, market-value gains far outstripped the performance of the\nbusinesses. In the aftermath of the Bubble, the reverse was true.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

Unfortunately,\nhowever, it’s the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged. Our\nhuge positions add to the difficulty of our nimbly dancing in and out of holdings as valuations swing.\nNevertheless, I can properly be criticized for merely clucking about nose-bleed valuations during\nthe Bubble rather than acting on my views. Though I said at the time that certain of the stocks we held\nwere priced ahead of themselves, I underestimated just how severe the overvaluation was. I talked when I\nshould have walked.\nWhat Charlie and I would like is a little action now. We don’t enjoy sitting on $43 billion of cash\nequivalents that are earning paltry returns. Instead, we yearn to buy more fractional interests similar to\nthose we now own or – better still – more large businesses outright. We will do either, however, only when\npurchases can be made at prices that offer us the prospect of a reasonable return on our investment.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe’ve repeatedly emphasized that the “realized” gains that we report quarterly or annually are\nmeaningless for analytical purposes. We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our\nthinking about when, and if, to cash them depends not at all on a desire to report earnings at one specific\ntime or another. A further complication in our reported gains occurs because GAAP requires that foreign\nexchange contracts be marked to market, a stipulation that causes unrealized gains or losses in these\nholdings to flow through our published earnings as if we had sold our positions.\nDespite the problems enumerated, you may be interested in a breakdown of the gains we reported\nin 2003 and 2004. The data reflect actual sales except in the case of currency gains, which are a\ncombination of sales and marks to market.\nCategory Pre-Tax Gain (in $ millions)\n2004 2003\nCommon Stocks............................. $ 870 $ 448\nU. S. Government Bonds................. 104 1,485\nJunk Bonds..................................... 730 1,138\nForeign Exchange Contracts........... 1,839 825\nOther............................................... (47) 233\nTotal............................................... $3,496 $4,129\nThe junk bond profits include a foreign exchange component. When we bought these bonds in\n2001 and 2002, we focused first, of course, on the credit quality of the issuers, all of which were American\ncorporations. Some of these companies, however, had issued bonds denominated in foreign currencies.\nBecause of our views on the dollar, we favored these for purchase when they were available.\nAs an example, we bought €254 million of Level 3 bonds (10 ¾% of 2008) in 2001 at 51.7% of\npar, and sold these at 85% of par in December 2004. This issue was traded in Euros that cost us 88¢ at the\ntime of purchase but that brought $1.29 when we sold. Thus, of our $163 million overall gain, about $85\nmillion came from the market’s revised opinion about Level 3’s credit quality, with the remaining $78\nmillion resulting from the appreciation of the Euro. (In addition, we received cash interest during our\nholding period that amounted to about 25% annually on our dollar cost.)\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe media continue to report that “Buffett buys” this or that stock. Statements like these are\nalmost always based on filings Berkshire makes with the SEC and are therefore wrong. As I’ve said\nbefore, the stories should say “Berkshire buys.”\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

Take a look at the facing page to see why Lou is a cinch to be inducted into the\ninvestment Hall of Fame.\nYou may be surprised to learn that Lou does not necessarily inform me about what he is doing.\nWhen Charlie and I assign responsibility, we truly hand over the baton – and we give it to Lou just as we\ndo to our operating managers.

    "content": "Foreign Currencies\nBerkshire owned about $21.4 billion of foreign exchange contracts at yearend, spread among 12\ncurrencies. As I mentioned last year, holdings of this kind are a decided change for us. Before March\n2002, neither Berkshire nor I had ever traded in currencies. But the evidence grows that our trade policies\nwill put unremitting pressure on the dollar for many years to come – so since 2002 we’ve heeded that\nwarning in setting our investment course. (As W. C. Fields once said when asked for a handout: “Sorry,\nson, all my money’s tied up in currency.”)\nBe clear on one point: In no way does our thinking about currencies rest on doubts about America.\nWe live in an extraordinarily rich country, the product of a system that values market economics, the rule\nof law and equality of opportunity. Our economy is far and away the strongest in the world and will\ncontinue to be. We are lucky to live here.\nBut as I argued in a November 10,2003 article in Fortune, (available at berkshirehathaway. com),\nour country’s trade practices are weighing down the dollar. The decline in its value has already been\nsubstantial, but is nevertheless likely to continue. Without policy changes, currency markets could even\nbecome disorderly and generate spillover effects, both political and financial. No one knows whether these\nproblems will materialize. But such a scenario is a far-from-remote possibility that policymakers should be\nconsidering now. Their bent, however, is to lean toward not-so-benign neglect: A 318-page Congressional\nstudy of the consequences of unremitting trade deficits was published in November 2000 and has been\ngathering dust ever since. The study was ordered after the deficit hit a then-alarming $263 billion in 1999;\nby last year it had risen to $618 billion.\nCharlie and I, it should be emphasized, believe that true trade – that is, the exchange of goods and\nservices with other countries – is enormously beneficial for both us and them. Last year we had $1.15\ntrillion of such honest-to-God trade and the more of this, the better. But, as noted, our country also\npurchased an additional $618 billion in goods and services from the rest of the world that was\nunreciprocated. That is a staggering figure and one that has important consequences.\nThe balancing item to this one-way pseudo-trade — in economics there is always an offset — is a\ntransfer of wealth from the U. S. to the rest of the world. The transfer may materialize in the form of IOUs\nour private or governmental institutions give to foreigners, or by way of their assuming ownership of our\nassets, such as stocks and real estate. In either case, Americans end up owning a reduced portion of our\ncountry while non-Americans own a greater part. This force-feeding of American wealth to the rest of the\nworld is now proceeding at the rate of $1.8 billion daily, an increase of 20% since I wrote you last year.\nConsequently, other countries and their citizens now own a net of about $3 trillion of the U. S. A decade\nago their net ownership was negligible.\nThe mention of trillions numbs most brains. A further source of confusion is that the current\naccount deficit (the sum of three items, the most important by far being the trade deficit) and our national\nbudget deficit are often lumped as “twins.” They are anything but. They have different causes and\ndifferent consequences.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "A budget deficit in no way reduces the portion of the national pie that goes to Americans. As long\nas other countries and their citizens have no net ownership of the U. S., 100% of our country’s output\nbelongs to our citizens under any budget scenario, even one involving a huge deficit.\nAs a rich “family” awash in goods, Americans will argue through their legislators as to how\ngovernment should redistribute the national output – that is who pays taxes and who receives governmental\nbenefits. If “entitlement” promises from an earlier day have to be reexamined, “family members” will\nangrily debate among themselves as to who feels the pain. Maybe taxes will go up; maybe promises will\nbe modified; maybe more internal debt will be issued. But when the fight is finished, all of the family’s\nhuge pie remains available for its members, however it is divided. No slice must be sent abroad.\nLarge and persisting current account deficits produce an entirely different result. As time passes,\nand as claims against us grow, we own less and less of what we produce. In effect, the rest of the world\nenjoys an ever-growing royalty on American output. Here, we are like a family that consistently\noverspends its income. As time passes, the family finds that it is working more and more for the “finance\ncompany” and less for itself.\nShould we continue to run current account deficits comparable to those now prevailing, the net\nownership of the U. S. by other countries and their citizens a decade from now will amount to roughly $11\ntrillion. And, if foreign investors were to earn only 5% on that net holding, we would need to send a net of\n$. 55 trillion of goods and services abroad every year merely to service the U. S. investments then held by\nforeigners. At that date, a decade out, our GDP would probably total about $18 trillion (assuming low\ninflation, which is far from a sure thing). Therefore, our U. S. “family” would then be delivering 3% of its\nannual output to the rest of the world simply as tribute for the overindulgences of the past. In this case,\nunlike that involving budget deficits, the sons would truly pay for the sins of their fathers.\nThis annual royalty paid the world – which would not disappear unless the U. S. massively\nunderconsumed and began to run consistent and large trade surpluses – would undoubtedly produce\nsignificant political unrest in the U. S. Americans would still be living very well, indeed better than now\nbecause of the growth in our economy. But they would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to\ntheir creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an “Ownership Society” will not find\nhappiness in – and I’ll use hyperbole here for emphasis – a “Sharecropper’s Society.” But that’s precisely\nwhere our trade policies, supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, are taking us.\nMany prominent U. S. financial figures, both in and out of government, have stated that our\ncurrent-account deficits cannot persist. For instance, the minutes of the Federal Reserve Open Market\nCommittee of June 29-30,2004 say: “The staff noted that outsized external deficits could not be sustained\nindefinitely.” But, despite the constant handwringing by luminaries, they offer no substantive suggestions\nto tame the burgeoning imbalance.\nIn the article I wrote for Fortune 16 months ago, I warned that “a gently declining dollar would\nnot provide the answer.” And so far it hasn’t. Yet policymakers continue to hope for a “soft landing,”\nmeanwhile counseling other countries to stimulate (read “inflate”) their economies and Americans to save\nmore. In my view these admonitions miss the mark: There are deep-rooted structural problems that will\ncause America to continue to run a huge current-account deficit unless trade policies either change\nmaterially or the dollar declines by a degree that could prove unsettling to financial markets.\nProponents of the trade status quo are fond of quoting Adam Smith: “What is prudence in the\nconduct of every family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us\nwith a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the\nproduce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.”\nI agree. Note, however, that Mr. Smith’s statement refers to trade of product for product, not of\nwealth for product as our country is doing to the tune of $. 6 trillion annually. Moreover, I am sure that he\nwould never have suggested that “prudence” consisted of his “family” selling off part of its farm every day\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "in order to finance its overconsumption. Yet that is just what the “great kingdom” called the United States\nis doing.\nIf the U. S. was running a $. 6 trillion current-account surplus, commentators worldwide would\nviolently condemn our policy, viewing it as an extreme form of “mercantilism” – a long-discredited\neconomic strategy under which countries fostered exports, discouraged imports, and piled up treasure. I\nwould condemn such a policy as well. But, in effect if not in intent, the rest of the world is practicing\nmercantilism in respect to the U. S., an act made possible by our vast store of assets and our pristine credit\nhistory. Indeed, the world would never let any other country use a credit card denominated in its own\ncurrency to the insatiable extent we are employing ours. Presently, most foreign investors are sanguine:\nthey may view us as spending junkies, but they know we are rich junkies as well.\nOur spendthrift behavior won’t, however, be tolerated indefinitely. And though it’s impossible to\nforecast just when and how the trade problem will be resolved, it’s improbable that the resolution will\nfoster an increase in the value of our currency relative to that of our trading partners.\nWe hope the U. S. adopts policies that will quickly and substantially reduce the current-account\ndeficit. True, a prompt solution would likely cause Berkshire to record losses on its foreign-exchange\ncontracts. But Berkshire’s resources remain heavily concentrated in dollar-based assets, and both a strong\ndollar and a low-inflation environment are very much in our interest.\nIf you wish to keep abreast of trade and currency matters, read The Financial Times. This\nLondon-based paper has long been the leading source for daily international financial news and now has an\nexcellent American edition. Both its reporting and commentary on trade are first-class.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnd, again, our usual caveat: macro-economics is a tough game in which few people, Charlie and\nI included, have demonstrated skill. We may well turn out to be wrong in our currency judgments.\n(Indeed, the fact that so many pundits now predict weakness for the dollar makes us uneasy.) If so, our\nmistake will be very public. The irony is that if we chose the opposite course, leaving all of Berkshire’s\nassets in dollars even as they declined significantly in value, no one would notice our mistake.\nJohn Maynard Keynes said in his masterful The General Theory: “Worldly wisdom teaches that it\nis better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” (Or, to put it in less elegant\nterms, lemmings as a class may be derided but never does an individual lemming get criticized.) From a\nreputational standpoint, Charlie and I run a clear risk with our foreign-exchange commitment. But we\nbelieve in managing Berkshire as if we owned 100% of it ourselves. And, were that the case, we would not\nbe following a dollar-only policy.",

    "content": "Miscellaneous\n• Last year I told you about a group of University of Tennessee finance students who played a key\nrole in our $1.7 billion acquisition of Clayton Homes. Earlier, they had been brought to Omaha by\ntheir professor, Al Auxier – he brings a class every year – to tour Nebraska Furniture Mart and\nBorsheim’s, eat at Gorat’s and have a Q&A session with me at Kiewit Plaza. These visitors, like\nthose who come for our annual meeting, leave impressed by both the city and its friendly\nresidents.\nOther colleges and universities have now come calling. This school year we will have visiting\nclasses, ranging in size from 30 to 100 students, from Chicago, Dartmouth (Tuck), Delaware State,\nFlorida State, Indiana, Iowa, Iowa State, Maryland, Nebraska, Northwest Nazarene, Pennsylvania\n(Wharton), Stanford, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A&M, Toronto (Rotman), Union and Utah. Most\nof the students are MBA candidates, and I’ve been impressed by their quality. They are keenly\ninterested in business and investments, but their questions indicate that they also have more on\ntheir minds than simply making money. I always feel good after meeting them.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nAt our sessions, I tell the newcomers the story of the Tennessee group and its spotting of Clayton\nHomes. I do this in the spirit of the farmer who enters his hen house with an ostrich egg and\nadmonishes the flock: “I don’t like to complain, girls, but this is just a small sample of what the\ncompetition is doing.” To date, our new scouts have not brought us deals. But their mission in\nlife has been made clear to them.\n• You should be aware of an accounting rule that mildly distorts our financial statements in a paintoday, gain-tomorrow manner. Berkshire purchases life insurance policies from individuals and\ncorporations who would otherwise surrender them for cash. As the new holder of the policies, we\npay any premiums that become due and ultimately – when the original holder dies – collect the\nface value of the policies.\nThe original policyholder is usually in good health when we purchase the policy. Still, the price\nwe pay for it is always well above its cash surrender value (“CSV”). Sometimes the original\npolicyholder has borrowed against the CSV to make premium payments. In that case, the\nremaining CSV will be tiny and our purchase price will be a large multiple of what the original\npolicyholder would have received, had he cashed out by surrendering it.\nUnder accounting rules, we must immediately charge as a realized capital loss the excess over\nCSV that we pay upon purchasing the policy. We also must make additional charges each year for\nthe amount by which the premium we pay to keep the policy in force exceeds the increase in CSV.\nBut obviously, we don’t think these bookkeeping charges represent economic losses. If we did,\nwe wouldn’t buy the policies.\nDuring 2004, we recorded net “losses” from the purchase of policies (and from the premium\npayments required to maintain them) totaling $207 million, which was charged against realized\ninvestment gains in our earnings statement (included in “other” in the table on page 17). When\nthe proceeds from these policies are received in the future, we will record as realized investment\ngain the excess over the then-CSV.\n• Two post-bubble governance reforms have been particularly useful at Berkshire, and I fault myself\nfor not putting them in place many years ago. The first involves regular meetings of directors\nwithout the CEO present. I’ve sat on 19 boards, and on many occasions this process would have\nled to dubious plans being examined more thoroughly. In a few cases, CEO changes that were\nneeded would also have been made more promptly. There is no downside to this process, and\nthere are many possible benefits.\nThe second reform concerns the “whistleblower line,” an arrangement through which employees\ncan send information to me and the board’s audit committee without fear of reprisal. Berkshire’s\nextreme decentralization makes this system particularly valuable both to me and the committee.\n(In a sprawling “city” of 180,000 – Berkshire’s current employee count – not every sparrow that\nfalls will be noticed at headquarters.) Most of the complaints we have received are of “the guy\nnext to me has bad breath” variety, but on occasion I have learned of important problems at our\nsubsidiaries that I otherwise would have missed. The issues raised are usually not of a type\ndiscoverable by audit, but relate instead to personnel and business practices. Berkshire would be\nmore valuable today if I had put in a whistleblower line decades ago.\n• Charlie and I love the idea of shareholders thinking and behaving like owners. Sometimes that\nrequires them to be pro-active. And in this arena large institutional owners should lead the way.\nSo far, however, the moves made by institutions have been less than awe-inspiring. Usually,\nthey’ve focused on minutiae and ignored the three questions that truly count. First, does the\ncompany have the right CEO? Second, is he/she overreaching in terms of compensation? Third,\nare proposed acquisitions more likely to create or destroy per-share value?\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "On such questions, the interests of the CEO may well differ from those of the shareholders.\nDirectors, moreover, sometimes lack the knowledge or gumption to overrule the CEO. Therefore,\nit’s vital that large owners focus on these three questions and speak up when necessary.\nInstead many simply follow a “checklist” approach to the issue du jour. Last year I was on the\nreceiving end of a judgment reached in that manner. Several institutional shareholders and their\nadvisors decided I lacked “independence” in my role as a director of Coca-Cola. One group\nwanted me removed from the board and another simply wanted me booted from the audit\ncommittee.\nMy first impulse was to secretly fund the group behind the second idea. Why anyone would wish\nto be on an audit committee is beyond me. But since directors must be assigned to one committee\nor another, and since no CEO wants me on his compensation committee, it’s often been my lot to\nget an audit committee assignment. As it turned out, the institutions that opposed me failed and I\nwas re-elected to the audit job. (I fought off the urge to ask for a recount.)\nSome institutions questioned my “independence” because, among other things, Mc Lane and Dairy\nQueen buy lots of Coke products. (Do they want us to favor Pepsi?) But independence is defined\nin Webster’s as “not subject to control by others.” I’m puzzled how anyone could conclude that\nour Coke purchases would “control” my decision-making when the counterweight is the wellbeing of $8 billion of Coke stock held by Berkshire. Assuming I’m even marginally rational,\nelementary arithmetic should make it clear that my heart and mind belong to the owners of Coke,\nnot to its management.\nI can’t resist mentioning that Jesus understood the calibration of independence far more clearly\nthan do the protesting institutions. In Matthew 6: 21 He observed: “For where your treasure is,\nthere will your heart be also.” Even to an institutional investor, $8 billion should qualify as\n“treasure” that dwarfs any profits Berkshire might earn on its routine transactions with Coke.\nMeasured by the biblical standard, the Berkshire board is a model: (a) every director is a member\nof a family owning at least $4 million of stock; (b) none of these shares were acquired from\nBerkshire via options or grants; (c) no directors receive committee, consulting or board fees from\nthe company that are more than a tiny portion of their annual income; and (d) although we have a\nstandard corporate indemnity arrangement, we carry no liability insurance for directors.\nAt Berkshire, board members travel the same road as shareholders.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I have seen much behavior confirming the Bible’s “treasure” point. In our view,\nbased on our considerable boardroom experience, the least independent directors are likely to be\nthose who receive an important fraction of their annual income from the fees they receive for\nboard service (and who hope as well to be recommended for election to other boards and thereby\nto boost their income further). Yet these are the very board members most often classed as\n“independent.”\nMost directors of this type are decent people and do a first-class job. But they wouldn’t be human\nif they weren’t tempted to thwart actions that would threaten their livelihood. Some may go on to\nsuccumb to such temptations.\nLet’s look at an example based upon circumstantial evidence. I have first-hand knowledge of a\nrecent acquisition proposal (not from Berkshire) that was favored by management, blessed by the\ncompany’s investment banker and slated to go forward at a price above the level at which the\nstock had sold for some years (or now sells for). In addition, a number of directors favored the\ntransaction and wanted it proposed to shareholders.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Several of their brethren, however, each of whom received board and committee fees totaling\nabout $100,000 annually, scuttled the proposal, which meant that shareholders never learned of\nthis multi-billion offer. Non-management directors owned little stock except for shares they had\nreceived from the company. Their open-market purchases in recent years had meanwhile been\nnominal, even though the stock had sold far below the acquisition price proposed. In other words,\nthese directors didn’t want the shareholders to be offered X even though they had consistently\ndeclined the opportunity to buy stock for their own account at a fraction of X.\nI don’t know which directors opposed letting shareholders see the offer. But I do know that\n$100,000 is an important portion of the annual income of some of those deemed “independent,”\nclearly meeting the Matthew 6: 21 definition of “treasure.” If the deal had gone through, these fees\nwould have ended.\nNeither the shareholders nor I will ever know what motivated the dissenters. Indeed they\nthemselves will not likely know, given that self-interest inevitably blurs introspection. We do\nknow one thing, though: At the same meeting at which the deal was rejected, the board voted itself\na significant increase in directors’ fees.\n• While we are on the subject of self-interest, let’s turn again to the most important accounting\nmechanism still available to CEOs who wish to overstate earnings: the non-expensing of stock\noptions. The accomplices in perpetuating this absurdity have been many members of Congress\nwho have defied the arguments put forth by all Big Four auditors, all members of the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board and virtually all investment professionals.\nI’m enclosing an op-ed piece I wrote for The Washington Post describing a truly breathtaking bill\nthat was passed 312-111 by the House last summer. Thanks to Senator Richard Shelby, the Senate\ndidn’t ratify the House’s foolishness. And, to his great credit, Bill Donaldson, the investorminded Chairman of the SEC, has stood firm against massive political pressure, generated by the\ncheck-waving CEOs who first muscled Congress in 1993 about the issue of option accounting and\nthen repeated the tactic last year.\nBecause the attempts to obfuscate the stock-option issue continue, it’s worth pointing out that no\none – neither the FASB, nor investors generally, nor I – are talking about restricting the use of\noptions in any way. Indeed, my successor at Berkshire may well receive much of his pay via\noptions, albeit logically-structured ones in respect to 1) an appropriate strike price, 2) an escalation\nin price that reflects the retention of earnings, and 3) a ban on his quickly disposing of any shares\npurchased through options. We cheer arrangements that motivate managers, whether these be\ncash bonuses or options. And if a company is truly receiving value for the options it issues, we\nsee no reason why recording their cost should cut down on their use.\nThe simple fact is that certain CEOs know their own compensation would be far more rationally\ndetermined if options were expensed. They also suspect that their stock would sell at a lower price\nif realistic accounting were employed, meaning that they would reap less in the market when they\nunloaded their personal holdings. To these CEOs such unpleasant prospects are a fate to be fought\nwith all the resources they have at hand – even though the funds they use in that fight normally\ndon’t belong to them, but are instead put up by their shareholders.\nOption-expensing is scheduled to become mandatory on June 15 th. You can therefore expect\nintensified efforts to stall or emasculate this rule between now and then. Let your Congressman\nand Senators know what you think on this issue.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "The Annual Meeting\nThere are two changes this year concerning the annual meeting. First, we have scheduled the\nmeeting for the last Saturday in April (the 30 th), rather than the usual first Saturday in May. This year\nMother’s Day falls on May 8, and it would be unfair to ask the employees of Borsheim’s and Gorat’s to\ntake care of us at that special time – so we’ve moved everything up a week. Next year we’ll return to our\nregular timing, holding the meeting on May 6,2006.\nAdditionally, we are changing the sequence of events on meeting day, April 30. Just as always,\nthe doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a. m. and the movie will be shown at 8: 30. At 9: 30, however,\nwe will go directly to the question and answer period, which (allowing for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will\nlast until 3: 00. Then, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3: 15.\nWe have made this change because a number of shareholders complained last year about the time\nconsumed by two speakers who advocated proposals of limited interest to the majority of the audience –\nand who were no doubt relishing their chance to talk to a captive group of about 19,500. With our new\nprocedure, those shareholders who wish to hear it all can stick around for the formal meeting and those who\ndon’t can leave – or better yet shop.\nThere will be plenty of opportunity for that pastime in the vast exhibition hall that adjoins the\nmeeting area. Kelly Muchemore, the Flo Ziegfeld of Berkshire, put on a magnificent shopping\nextravaganza last year, and she says that was just a warm-up for this year. (Kelly, I am delighted to report,\nis getting married in October. I’m giving her away and suggested that she make a little history by holding\nthe wedding at the annual meeting. She balked, however, when Charlie insisted that he be the ringbearer.)\nAgain we will showcase a 2,100 square foot Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet,\nJohns Manville insulation, Mi Tek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture). Take a tour through\nthe home. Better yet, buy it.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you\nmoney.\nOn Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from Net Jets®\navailable for your inspection. Stop by the Net Jets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.\nCome to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane.\nThe Bookworm shop did a terrific business last year selling Berkshire-related books. Displaying\n18 titles, they sold 2,920 copies for $61,000. Since we charge the shop no rent (I must be getting soft), it\ngives shareholders a 20% discount. This year I’ve asked The Bookworm to add Graham Allison’s Nuclear\nTerrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, a must-read for those concerned with the safety of our\ncountry. In addition, the shop will premiere Poor Charlie’s Almanack, a book compiled by Peter Kaufman.\nScholars have for too long debated whether Charlie is the reincarnation of Ben Franklin. This book should\nsettle the question.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain\nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. They do\na terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific,\nwe will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM eight years\nago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $25.1 million in 2004 (up 45%\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "from a year earlier). Every year has set a new record, and on Saturday of last year, we had the largest\nsingle-day sales in NFM’s history – $6.1 million.\nTo get the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 28 and Monday,\nMay 2 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to\nthe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but\nthat, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their\ncooperation. NFM is open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on\nSunday. On Saturday this year, from 5: 30 p. m. to 8 p. m. we are having a special affair for shareholders\nonly. I’ll be there, eating barbeque and drinking Coke.\nBorsheim’s – the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store – will\nhave two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p. m. to 10 p. m. on Friday,\nApril 29. The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m. on Sunday, May 1. On Saturday, we\nwill be open until 6 p. m.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheim’s throughout the weekend. For your convenience,\ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25 through Saturday, May 7. During\nthat period, just identify yourself as a shareholder through your meeting credentials or a brokerage\nstatement.\nBorsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its\nmajor rivals, even before the shareholders’ discount. Last year, business over the weekend increased 73%\nfrom 2003, setting a record that will be tough to beat. Show me it can be done.\nIn a tent outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick Wolff, twice U. S. chess champion, will take on all comers\nin groups of six – blindfolded. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the\nworld’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. They plan to keep\ntheir eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, even when playing for a national championship.\nGorat’s – my favorite steakhouse – will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on\nSunday, May 1, and will be serving from 4 p. m. until 10 p. m. Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on\nthat day, you must have a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before). If\nSunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town. Enhance your reputation\nas an epicure by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double helping of hash browns.\nWe will again have a special reception from 4: 00 to 5: 30 on Saturday afternoon for shareholders\nwho have come from outside of North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around\nthe globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we\nenjoyed meeting more than 400 of you including at least 100 from Australia. Any shareholder who comes\nfrom other than the U. S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this\nfunction.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I are lucky. We have jobs that we love and are helped every day in a myriad of ways\nby talented and cheerful associates. No wonder we tap-dance to work. But nothing is more fun for us than\ngetting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting. So join us on April 30 th at the\nQwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.\nFebruary 28,2005 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
