    "content": "1997 Chairman's Letter\n\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1997\nwas $8.0 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our\nClass A and Class B stock by 34.1%. Over the last 33 years (that is, since\npresent management took over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to\n$25,488, a rate of 24.1% compounded annually.\n(1)\n\n1. All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares,\nthe successor to the only stock that the company had outstanding\nbefore 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30 th\nthat of the A.\n\nGiven our gain of 34.1%, it is\ntempting to declare victory and move on. But last year's performance was\nno great triumph:\nAny\ninvestor can chalk up large returns when stocks\nsoar, as they did in 1997. In a bull market, one must avoid the error of\nthe preening duck that quacks boastfully after a torrential rainstorm,\nthinking that its paddling skills have caused it to rise in the world.\nA right-thinking duck would instead compare its position after the downpour\nto that of the other ducks on the pond.\n\nSo what's our duck rating for 1997?\nThe table on the facing page shows that though we paddled furiously last\nyear, passive ducks that simply invested in the S&P Index rose almost\nas fast as we did. Our appraisal of 1997's performance, then:\nQuack\n.\n\nWhen the market booms, we tend\nto suffer in comparison with the S&P Index. The Index bears no tax\ncosts, nor do mutual funds, since they pass through all tax liabilities\nto their owners. Last year, on the other hand, Berkshire paid or accrued\n$4.2 billion for federal income tax, or about 18% of our beginning net\nworth.\n\nBerkshire will always have corporate\ntaxes to pay, which means it needs to overcome their drag in order to justify\nits existence. Obviously, Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and\nmy partner, and I won't be able to lick that handicap every year. But we\nexpect over time to maintain a modest advantage over the Index, and that\nis the yardstick against which you should measure us. We will not ask you\nto adopt the philosophy of the Chicago Cubs fan who reacted to a string\nof lackluster seasons by saying, \"Why get upset? Everyone has a bad\ncentury now and then.\"\n\nGains in book value are, of course,\nnot the bottom line at Berkshire. What truly counts are gains in per-share\nintrinsic business value. Ordinarily, though, the two measures tend to\nmove roughly in tandem, and in 1997 that was the case: Led by a blow-out\nperformance at GEICO, Berkshire's intrinsic value (which far exceeds book\nvalue) grew at nearly the same pace as book value.\n\nFor more explanation of the term,\nintrinsic value, you may wish to refer to our Owner's Manual, reprinted\non pages 62 to 71. This manual sets forth our owner-related business principles,\ninformation that is important to all of Berkshire's shareholders.",

    "content": "In our last two annual reports,\nwe furnished you a table that Charlie and I believe is central to estimating\nBerkshire's intrinsic value. In the updated version of that table, which\nfollows, we trace our two key components of value. The first column lists\nour per-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents)\nand the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's operating\nbusinesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments (discussed\non pages 69 and 70), but after all interest and corporate expenses. The\nsecond column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we\nrealized from the investments presented in the first column. In effect,\nthe columns show what Berkshire would look like were it split into two\nparts, with one entity holding our investments and the other operating\nall of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.\n\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments Excluding All Income from\n\nYear\n\nPer Share\n\nInvestments\n\n1967 $ 41 $ 1.09\n1977 372 12.44\n1987 3,910 108.14\n1997 38,043 717.82\n\nPundits who ignore what our 38,000\nemployees contribute to the company, and instead simply view Berkshire\nas a de facto investment company, should study the figures in the second\ncolumn. We made our first business acquisition in 1967, and since then\nour pre-tax operating earnings have grown from $1 million to $888 million.\nFurthermore, as noted, in this exercise we have assigned all of Berkshire's\ncorporate expenses -- overhead of $6.6 million, interest of $66.9 million\nand shareholder contributions of $15.4 million -- to our business operations,\neven though a portion of these could just as well have been assigned to\nthe investment side.\n\nHere are the growth rates of the\ntwo segments by decade:\n\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments Excluding All Income from\n\nDecade Ending\n\nPer Share\n\nInvestments\n\n1977 24.6% 27.6%\n1987 26.5% 24.1%\n1997 25.5% 20.8%\nAnnual Growth\nRate, 1967-1997 25.6% 24.2%\n\nDuring 1997, both parts of our\nbusiness grew at a satisfactory rate, with investments increasing by $9,543\nper share, or 33.5%, and operating earnings growing by $296.43 per share,\nor 70.3%. One important caveat: Because we were lucky in our super-cat\ninsurance business (to be discussed later) and because GEICO's underwriting\ngain was well above what we can expect in most years, our 1997 operating\nearnings were much better than we anticipated and also more than we expect\nfor 1998.\n\nOur rate of progress in both investments\nand operations is\ncertain\nto fall in the future. For anyone deploying\ncapital, nothing recedes like success. My own history makes the point:\nBack in 1951, when I was attending Ben Graham's class at Columbia, an idea\ngiving me a $10,000 gain improved my investment performance for the year\nby a full 100 percentage points. Today, an idea producing a $500 million\npre-tax profit for Berkshire adds\none\npercentage point to our performance.\nIt's no wonder that my annual results in the 1950 s were better by nearly\nthirty percentage points than my annual gains in any subsequent decade.\nCharlie's experience was similar. We weren't smarter then, just smaller.\nAt our present size, any performance superiority we achieve will be minor.",

In his book\nThe Science\nof Hitting\n, Ted explains that he carved the strike zone into 77 cells,\neach the size of a baseball. Swinging only at balls in his \"best\"\ncell, he knew, would allow him to bat . 400; reaching for balls in his \"worst\"\nspot, the low outside corner of the strike zone, would reduce him to . 230.\nIn other words, waiting for the fat pitch would mean a trip to the Hall\nof Fame; swinging indiscriminately would mean a ticket to the minors.\n\nIf they are in the strike zone\nat all, the business \"pitches\" we now see are just catching the\nlower outside corner. If we swing, we will be locked into low returns.\nBut if we let all of today's balls go by, there can be no assurance that\nthe next ones we see will be more to our liking. Perhaps the attractive\nprices of the past were the aberrations, not the full prices of today.\nUnlike Ted, we can't be called out if we resist three pitches that are\nbarely in the strike zone; nevertheless, just standing there, day after\nday, with my bat on my shoulder is not my idea of fun.",

    "content": "When we can't find our favorite\ncommitment -- a well-run and sensibly-priced business with fine economics\n-- we usually opt to put new money into very short-term instruments of\nthe highest quality. Sometimes, however, we venture elsewhere. Obviously\nwe believe that the alternative commitments we make are more likely to\nresult in profit than loss. But we also realize that they do not offer\nthe certainty of profit that exists in a wonderful business secured at\nan attractive price. Finding that kind of opportunity, we\nknow\nthat\nwe are going to make money -- the only question being when. With alternative\ninvestments, we\nthink\nthat we are going to make money. But we also\nrecognize that we will sometimes realize losses, occasionally of substantial\nsize.\n\nWe had three non-traditional positions\nat yearend. The first was derivative contracts for 14.0 million barrels\nof oil, that being what was then left of a 45.7 million barrel position\nwe established in 1994-95. Contracts for 31.7 million barrels were settled\nin 1995-97, and these supplied us with a pre-tax gain of about $61.9 million.\nOur remaining contracts expire during 1998 and 1999. In these, we had an\nunrealized gain of $11.6 million at yearend. Accounting rules require that\ncommodity positions be carried at market value. Therefore, both our annual\nand quarterly financial statements reflect any unrealized gain or loss\nin these contracts. When we established our contracts, oil for future delivery\nseemed modestly underpriced. Today, though, we have no opinion as to its\nattractiveness.\n\nOur second non-traditional commitment\nis in silver. Last year, we purchased 111.2 million ounces. Marked to market,\nthat position produced a pre-tax gain of $97.4 million for us in 1997.\nIn a way, this is a return to the past for me: Thirty years ago, I bought\nsilver because I anticipated its demonetization by the U. S. Government.\nEver since, I have followed the metal's fundamentals but not owned it.\nIn recent years, bullion inventories have fallen materially, and last summer\nCharlie and I concluded that a higher price would be needed to establish\nequilibrium between supply and demand. Inflation expectations, it should\nbe noted, play no part in our calculation of silver's value.\n\nFinally, our largest non-traditional\nposition at yearend was $4.6 billion, at amortized cost, of long-term zero-coupon\nobligations of the U. S. Treasury. These securities pay no interest. Instead,\nthey provide their holders a return by way of the discount at which they\nare purchased, a characteristic that makes their market prices move rapidly\nwhen interest rates change. If rates rise, you lose heavily with zeros,\nand if rates fall, you make outsized gains. Since rates fell in 1997, we\nended the year with an unrealized pre-tax gain of $598.8 million in our\nzeros. Because we carry the securities at market value, that gain is reflected\nin yearend book value.\n\nIn purchasing zeros, rather than\nstaying with cash-equivalents, we risk looking very foolish: A macro-based\ncommitment such as this never has anything close to a 100% probability\nof being successful. However, you pay Charlie and me to use our best judgment\n-- not to avoid embarrassment -- and we will occasionally make an unconventional\nmove when we believe the odds favor it. Try to think kindly of us when\nwe blow one. Along with President Clinton, we will be feeling your pain:\nThe Munger family has more than 90% of its net worth in Berkshire and the\nBuffetts more than 99%.",

    "content": "A short quiz: If you plan to eat\nhamburgers throughout your life and are not a cattle producer, should you\nwish for higher or lower prices for beef? Likewise, if you are going to\nbuy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you\nprefer higher or lower car prices? These questions, of course, answer themselves.\n\nBut now for the final exam: If\nyou expect to be a net saver during the next five years, should you hope\nfor a higher or lower stock market during that period? Many investors get\nthis one wrong. Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for\nmany years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed\nwhen they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the\n\"hamburgers\" they will soon be buying. This reaction makes no\nsense. Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should\nbe happy at seeing stocks rise. Prospective purchasers should much prefer\nsinking prices.\n\nFor shareholders of Berkshire who\ndo not expect to sell, the choice is even clearer. To begin with, our owners\nare automatically saving even if they spend every dime they personally\nearn: Berkshire \"saves\" for them by retaining all earnings, thereafter\nusing these savings to purchase businesses and securities. Clearly, the\nmore cheaply we make these buys, the more profitable our owners' indirect\nsavings program will be.\n\nFurthermore, through Berkshire\nyou own major positions in companies that consistently repurchase their\nshares. The benefits that these programs supply us grow as prices fall:\nWhen stock prices are low, the funds that an investee spends on repurchases\nincrease our ownership of that company by a greater amount than is the\ncase when prices are higher. For example, the repurchases that Coca-Cola,\nThe Washington Post and Wells Fargo made in past years at very low prices\nbenefitted Berkshire far more than do today's repurchases, made at loftier\nprices.\n\nAt the end of every year, about\n97% of Berkshire's shares are held by the same investors who owned them\nat the start of the year. That makes them savers. They should therefore\nrejoice when markets decline and allow both us and our investees to deploy\nfunds more advantageously.\n\nSo smile when you read a headline\nthat says \"Investors lose as market falls.\" Edit it in your mind\nto \"\nDis\ninvestors lose as market falls -- but investors gain.\"\nThough writers often forget this truism, there is a buyer for every seller\nand what hurts one necessarily helps the other. (As they say in golf matches:\n\"Every putt makes\nsomeone\nhappy.\")\n\nWe gained enormously from the low\nprices placed on many equities and businesses in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Markets\nthat then were hostile to investment transients were friendly to those\ntaking up permanent residence. In recent years, the actions we took in\nthose decades have been validated, but we have found few new opportunities.\nIn its role as a corporate \"saver,\" Berkshire continually looks\nfor ways to sensibly deploy capital, but it may be some time before we\nfind opportunities that get us truly excited.",

    "content": "What does excite us, however, is\nour insurance business. GEICO is flying, and we expect that it will continue\nto do so. Before we expound on that, though, let's discuss \"float\"\nand how to measure its cost. Unless you understand this subject, it will\nbe impossible for you to make an informed judgment about Berkshire's intrinsic\nvalue.\n\nTo begin with, float is money we\nhold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums\nare received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends\nover many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. Typically,\nthis pleasant activity carries with it a downside: The premiums that an\ninsurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually\nmust pay. That leaves it running an \"underwriting loss,\" which\nis the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float\nover time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain\nfunds. But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than\nmarket rates for money.\n\nA caution is appropriate here:\nBecause loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in\nfiguring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for\ninvestors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Estimating errors,\nusually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge. The consequences of these\nmiscalculations flow directly into earnings. An experienced observer can\nusually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public\ncan typically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have\nbeen amazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed.\nAs for Berkshire, Charlie and I attempt to be conservative in presenting\nits underwriting results to you, because we have found that virtually all\nsurprises in insurance are unpleasant ones.\n\nAs the numbers in the following\ntable show, Berkshire's insurance business has been a huge winner. For\nthe table, we have calculated our float -- which we generate in large amounts\nrelative to our premium volume -- by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment\nreserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves,\nand then subtracting agents' balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid\ntaxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. Our cost\nof float is determined by our underwriting loss or profit. In those years\nwhen we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last five, our cost\nof float has been negative. In effect, we have been paid for holding money.\n\n(1) (2) Yearend Yield\nUnderwriting Approximate on Long-Term\n\nLoss\n\nAverage Float\n\nCost of Funds\n\nGovt.

    "content": "Occasionally, however, the cost\nof our float will spike severely. That will occur because of our heavy\ninvolvement in the super-cat business, which by its nature is the most\nvolatile of all insurance lines. In this operation, we sell policies that\ninsurance and reinsurance companies purchase in order to limit their losses\nwhen mega-catastrophes strike. Berkshire is the preferred market for sophisticated\nbuyers: When the \"big one\" hits, the financial strength of super-cat\nwriters will be tested, and Berkshire has no peer in this respect.\n\nSince truly major catastrophes\nare rare occurrences, our super-cat business can be expected to show large\nprofits in most years -- and to record a huge loss occasionally. In other\nwords, the attractiveness of our super-cat business will take a great many\nyears to measure.\nWhat you must understand, however, is that a truly\nterrible year in the super-cat business is not a possibility -- it's a\ncertainty. The only question is when it will come.\n\nLast year, we were very lucky in\nour super-cat operation. The world suffered no catastrophes that caused\nhuge amounts of insured damage, so virtually all premiums that we received\ndropped to the bottom line. This pleasant result has a dark side, however.\nMany investors who are \"innocents\" -- meaning that they rely\non representations of salespeople rather than on underwriting knowledge\nof their own -- have come into the reinsurance business by means of purchasing\npieces of paper that are called \"catastrophe bonds.\" The second\nword in this term, though, is an Orwellian misnomer: A true bond obliges\nthe issuer to pay; these bonds, in effect, are contracts that lay a provisional\npromise to pay on the\npurchaser\n.\n\nThis convoluted arrangement came\ninto being because the promoters of the contracts wished to circumvent\nlaws that prohibit the writing of insurance by entities that haven't been\nlicensed by the state. A side benefit for the promoters is that calling\nthe insurance contract a \"bond\" may also cause unsophisticated\nbuyers to assume that these instruments involve far less risk than is actually\nthe case.\n\nTruly outsized risks will exist\nin these contracts if they are not properly priced. A pernicious aspect\nof catastrophe insurance, however, makes it likely that mispricing, even\nof a severe variety, will not be discovered for a very long time. Consider,\nfor example, the odds of throwing a 12 with a pair of dice -- 1 out of\n36. Now assume that the dice will be thrown once a year; that you, the\n\"bond-buyer,\" agree to pay $50 million if a 12 appears; and that\nfor \"insuring\" this risk you take in an annual \"premium\"\nof $1 million. That would mean you had significantly underpriced the risk.\nNevertheless, you could go along for years thinking you were making money\n-- indeed, easy money. There is actually a 75.4% probability that you would\ngo for a decade without paying out a dime. Eventually, however, you would\ngo broke.",

    "content": "In this dice example, the odds\nare easy to figure. Calculations involving monster hurricanes and earthquakes\nare necessarily much fuzzier, and the best we can do at Berkshire is to\nestimate a range of probabilities for such events. The lack of precise\ndata, coupled with the rarity of such catastrophes, plays into the hands\nof promoters, who typically employ an \"expert\" to advise the\npotential bond-buyer about the probability of losses. The expert puts no\nmoney on the table. Instead, he receives an up-front payment that is forever\nhis no matter how inaccurate his predictions. Surprise: When the stakes\nare high, an expert can invariably be found who will affirm -- to return\nto our example -- that the chance of rolling a 12 is not 1 in 36, but more\nlike 1 in 100. (In fairness, we should add that the expert will probably\nbelieve that his odds are correct, a fact that makes him less reprehensible\n-- but more dangerous.)\n\nThe influx of \"investor\"\nmoney into catastrophe bonds -- which may well live up to their name --\nhas caused super-cat prices to deteriorate materially. Therefore, we will\nwrite less business in 1998. We have some large multi-year contracts in\nforce, however, that will mitigate the drop. The largest of these are two\npolicies that we described in last year's report -- one covering hurricanes\nin Florida and the other, signed with the California Earthquake Authority,\ncovering earthquakes in that state. Our \"worst-case\" loss remains\nabout $600 million after-tax, the maximum we could lose under the CEA policy.\nThough this loss potential may sound large, it is only about 1% of Berkshire's\nmarket value. Indeed, if we could get appropriate prices, we would be willing\nto significantly increase our \"worst-case\" exposure.\n\nOur super-cat business was developed\nfrom scratch by Ajit Jain, who has contributed to Berkshire's success in\na variety of other ways as well. Ajit possesses both the discipline to\nwalk away from business that is inadequately priced and the imagination\nto then find other opportunities. Quite simply, he is one of Berkshire's\nmajor assets. Ajit would have been a star in whatever career he chose;\nfortunately for us, he enjoys insurance.",

    "content": "Last year I wrote about GEICO's\nTony Nicely and his terrific management skills. If I had known then what\nhe had in store for us in 1997, I would have searched for still greater\nsuperlatives. Tony, now 54, has been with GEICO for 36 years and last year\nwas his best. As CEO, he has transmitted vision, energy and enthusiasm\nto all members of the GEICO family -- raising their sights from what\nhas\n\nbeen achieved to what\ncan\nbe achieved.\n\nWe measure GEICO's performance\nby first, the net increase in its voluntary auto policies (that is, not\nincluding policies assigned us by the state) and, second, the profitability\nof \"seasoned\" auto business, meaning policies that have been\nwith us for more than a year and are thus past the period in which acquisition\ncosts cause them to be money-losers. In 1996, in-force business grew 10%,\nand I told you how pleased I was, since that rate was well above anything\nwe had seen in two decades. Then, in 1997, growth jumped to 16%.\n\nBelow are the new business and\nin-force figures for the last five years:\n\nNew Voluntary Voluntary Auto\n\nYears\n\nAuto Policies\n\nPolicies in Force\n\n1993 354,882 2,011,055\n1994 396,217 2,147,549\n1995 461,608 2,310,037\n1996 617,669 2,543,699\n1997 913,176 2,949,439\n\nOf course, any insurer can grow\nrapidly if it gets careless about underwriting. GEICO's underwriting profit\nfor the year, though, was 8.1% of premiums, far above its average. Indeed,\nthat percentage was higher than we wish it to be: Our goal is to pass on\nmost of the benefits of our low-cost operation to our customers, holding\nourselves to about 4% in underwriting profit. With that in mind, we reduced\nour average rates a bit during 1997 and may well cut them again this year.\nOur rate changes varied, of course, depending on the policyholder and where\nhe lives; we strive to charge a rate that properly reflects the loss expectancy\nof each driver.\n\nGEICO is not the only auto insurer\nobtaining favorable results these days. Last year, the industry recorded\nprofits that were far better than it anticipated or can sustain. Intensified\ncompetition will soon squeeze margins very significantly. But this is a\ndevelopment we welcome: Long term, a tough market helps the low-cost operator,\nwhich is what we are and intend to remain.\n\nLast year I told you about the\nrecord 16.9% profit-sharing contribution that GEICO's associates had earned\nand explained that two simple variables set the amount: policy growth and\nprofitability of seasoned business. I further explained that 1996's performance\nwas so extraordinary that we had to enlarge the chart delineating the possible\npayouts. The new configuration didn't make it through 1997: We enlarged\nthe chart's boundaries again and awarded our 10,500 associates a profit-sharing\ncontribution amounting to 26.9% of their base compensation, or $71 million.\nIn addition, the same two variables -- policy growth and profitability\nof seasoned business -- determined the cash bonuses that we paid to dozens\nof top executives, starting with Tony.",

    "content": "At GEICO, we are paying in a way\nthat makes sense for both our owners and our managers. We distribute merit\nbadges, not lottery tickets: In none of Berkshire's subsidiaries do we\nrelate compensation to our stock price, which our associates cannot affect\nin any meaningful way. Instead, we tie bonuses to each unit's business\nperformance, which is the direct product of the unit's people. When that\nperformance is terrific -- as it has been at GEICO -- there is nothing\nCharlie and I enjoy more than writing a big check.\n\nGEICO's underwriting profitability\nwill probably fall in 1998, but the company's growth could accelerate.\nWe're planning to step on the gas: GEICO's marketing expenditures this\nyear will top $100 million, up 50% from 1997. Our market share today is\nonly 3%, a level of penetration that should increase dramatically in the\nnext decade. The auto insurance industry is huge -- it does about $115\nbillion of volume annually -- and there are tens of millions of drivers\nwho would save substantial money by switching to us.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nIn the 1995 report, I described\nthe enormous debt that you and I owe to Lorimer Davidson. On a Saturday\nearly in 1951, he patiently explained the ins and outs of both GEICO and\nits industry to me -- a 20-year-old stranger who'd arrived at GEICO's headquarters\nuninvited and unannounced. Davy later became the company's CEO and has\nremained my friend and teacher for 47 years. The huge rewards that GEICO\nhas heaped on Berkshire would not have materialized had it not been for\nhis generosity and wisdom. Indeed, had I not met Davy, I might never have\ngrown to understand the whole field of insurance, which over the years\nhas played such a key part in Berkshire's success.\n\nDavy turned 95 last year, and it's\ndifficult for him to travel. Nevertheless, Tony and I hope that we can\npersuade him to attend our annual meeting, so that our shareholders can\nproperly thank him for his important contributions to Berkshire. Wish us\nluck.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *",

Rod's three-year record is an amazing\n15.1%. Berkshire's workers' compensation business, run out of California\nby Brad Kinstler, had a modest underwriting loss in a difficult environment;\nits three-year underwriting record is a positive 1.5%. John Kizer, at Central\nStates Indemnity, set a new volume record while generating good underwriting\nearnings. At Kansas Bankers Surety, Don Towle more than lived up to the\nhigh expectations we had when we purchased the company in 1996.\n\nIn aggregate, these five operations\nrecorded an underwriting profit of 15.0%.

Jeff Comment, Helzberg's CEO, took decisive steps early\nin 1997 that enabled the company to gain real momentum by the crucial Christmas\nseason. In the early part of this year, as well, sales remained strong.\n\nCasual observers may not appreciate\njust how extraordinary the performance of many of our businesses has been:\nIf the earnings history of, say, Buffalo News or Scott Fetzer is compared\nto the records of their publicly-owned peers, their performance might seem\nto have been unexceptional. But most public companies retain two-thirds\nor more of their earnings to fund their corporate growth. In contrast,\nthose Berkshire subsidiaries have paid 100% of their earnings to us, their\nparent company, to fund\nour\ngrowth.\n\nIn effect, the records of the public\ncompanies reflect the cumulative benefits of the earnings they have retained,\nwhile the records of our operating subsidiaries get no such boost. Over\ntime, however, the earnings these subsidiaries have distributed have created\ntruly huge amounts of earning power elsewhere in Berkshire. The News, See's\nand Scott Fetzer have alone paid us $1.8 billion, which we have gainfully\nemployed elsewhere. We owe their managements our gratitude for much more\nthan the earnings that are detailed in the table.\n\nAdditional information about our\nvarious businesses is given on pages 36 - 50, where you will also find\nour segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. In addition, on pages 55\n- 61, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments\non a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie\nand I think about the company. Our intent is to supply you with the financial\ninformation that we would wish you to give us if our positions were reversed.",

Not that we mind this division\nof money, since on balance we regard the undistributed earnings of investees\nas more valuable to us than the portion paid out. The reason is simple:\nOur investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high rates\nof return. So why should we want them paid out?\n\nTo depict something closer to economic\nreality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept\nof \"look-through\" earnings. As we calculate these, they consist\nof: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous section, plus;\n(2) our share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that,\nunder GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our profits, less; (3) an allowance\nfor the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings\nof investees had instead been distributed to us. When tabulating \"operating\nearnings\" here, we exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well\nas capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nour 1997 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can\nbe no more than approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment\ncalls.

    "content": "In 1997, we agreed to acquire Star\nFurniture and International Dairy Queen (a deal that closed early in 1998).\nBoth businesses fully meet our criteria: They are understandable; possess\nexcellent economics; and are run by outstanding people.\n\nThe Star transaction has an interesting\nhistory. Whenever we buy into an industry whose leading participants aren't\nknown to me, I always ask our new partners, \"Are there any more at\nhome like you?\" Upon our purchase of Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983,\ntherefore, the Blumkin family told me about three outstanding furniture\nretailers in other parts of the country. At the time, however, none was\nfor sale.\n\nMany years later, Irv Blumkin learned\nthat Bill Child, CEO of R. C. Willey -- one of the recommended three --\nmight be interested in merging, and we promptly made the deal described\nin the 1995 report. We have been delighted with that association -- Bill\nis the perfect partner. Furthermore, when we asked Bill about industry\nstandouts, he came up with the remaining two names given me by the Blumkins,\none of these being Star Furniture of Houston. But time went by without\nthere being any indication that either of the two was available.\n\nOn the Thursday before last year's\nannual meeting, however, Bob Denham of Salomon told me that Melvyn Wolff,\nthe long-time controlling shareholder and CEO of Star, wanted to talk.\nAt our invitation, Melvyn came to the meeting and spent his time in Omaha\nconfirming his positive feelings about Berkshire. I, meanwhile, looked\nat Star's financials, and liked what I saw.\n\nA few days later, Melvyn and I\nmet in New York and made a deal in a single, two-hour session. As was the\ncase with the Blumkins and Bill Child, I had no need to check leases, work\nout employment contracts, etc. I knew I was dealing with a man of integrity\nand that's what counted.\n\nThough the Wolff family's association\nwith Star dates back to 1924, the business struggled until Melvyn and his\nsister Shirley Toomin took over in 1962. Today Star operates 12 stores\n-- ten in Houston and one each in Austin and Bryan -- and will soon move\ninto San Antonio as well. We won't be surprised if Star is many times its\npresent size a decade from now.\n\nHere's a story illustrating what\nMelvyn and Shirley are like: When they told their associates of the sale,\nthey also announced that Star would make large, special payments to those\nwho had helped them succeed -- and then defined that group as everyone\nin the business. Under the terms of our deal, it was Melvyn and Shirley's\nmoney, not ours, that funded this distribution. Charlie and I love it when\nwe become partners with people who behave like that.\n\nThe Star transaction closed on\nJuly 1. In the months since, we've watched Star's already-excellent sales\nand earnings growth accelerate further. Melvyn and Shirley will be at the\nannual meeting, and I hope you get a chance to meet them.",

In 190 locations,\n\"treat centers\" provide some combination of the three products.\n\nFor many years IDQ had a bumpy\nhistory. Then, in 1970, a Minneapolis group led by John Mooty and Rudy\nLuther took control. The new managers inherited a jumble of different franchising\nagreements, along with some unwise financing arrangements that had left\nthe company in a precarious condition. In the years that followed, management\nrationalized the operation, extended food service to many more locations,\nand, in general, built a strong organization.\n\nLast summer Mr. Luther died, which\nmeant his estate needed to sell stock. A year earlier, Dick Kiphart of\nWilliam Blair & Co., had introduced me to John Mooty and Mike Sullivan,\nIDQ's CEO, and I had been impressed with both men. So, when we got the\nchance to merge with IDQ, we offered a proposition patterned on our Flight Safety\nacquisition, extending selling shareholders the option of choosing either\ncash or Berkshire shares having a slightly lower immediate value. By tilting\nthe consideration as we did, we encouraged holders to opt for cash, the\ntype of payment we by far prefer. Even then, only 45% of IDQ shares elected\ncash.\n\nCharlie and I bring a modicum of\nproduct expertise to this transaction: He has been patronizing the Dairy\nQueens in Cass Lake and Bemidji, Minnesota, for decades, and I have been\na regular in Omaha.

A study\nof the record will tell you why: If you aggregate all of our stock-only\nmergers (excluding those we did with two affiliated companies, Diversified\nRetailing and Blue Chip Stamps), you will find that our shareholders are\nslightly worse off than they would have been had I not done the transactions.\nThough it hurts me to say it, when I've issued stock, I've cost you money.\n\nBe clear about one thing: This\ncost has\nnot\noccurred because we were misled in any way by sellers\nor because they thereafter failed to manage with diligence and skill. On\nthe contrary, the sellers were completely candid when we were negotiating\nour deals and have been energetic and effective ever since.\n\nInstead, our problem has been that\nwe own a truly marvelous collection of businesses, which means that trading\naway a portion of them for something new almost never makes sense. When\nwe issue shares in a merger, we reduce your ownership in all of our businesses\n-- partly-owned companies such as Coca-Cola, Gillette and American Express,\nand all of our terrific operating companies as well. An example from sports\nwill illustrate the difficulty we face: For a baseball team, acquiring\na player who can be expected to bat . 350 is almost always a wonderful event\n--\nexcept\nwhen the team must trade a . 380 hitter to make the deal.\n\nBecause our roster is filled with\n. 380 hitters, we have tried to pay cash for acquisitions, and here our\nrecord has been far better. Starting with National Indemnity in 1967, and\ncontinuing with, among others, See's, Buffalo News, Scott Fetzer and GEICO,\nwe have acquired -- for cash -- a number of large businesses that have\nperformed incredibly well since we bought them. These acquisitions have\ndelivered Berkshire tremendous value -- indeed, far more than I anticipated\nwhen we made our purchases.\n\nWe believe that it is almost impossible\nfor us to \"trade up\" from our present businesses and managements.\nOur situation is the opposite of Camelot's Mordred, of whom Guenevere commented,\n\"The one thing I can say for him is that he is bound to marry well.\nEverybody is above him.\" Marrying well is extremely difficult for\nBerkshire.\n\nSo you can be sure that Charlie\nand I will be very reluctant to issue shares in the future. In those cases\nwhen we simply must do so -- when certain shareholders of a desirable acquiree\ninsist on getting stock -- we will include an attractive cash option in\norder to tempt as many of the sellers to take cash as is possible.",

    "content": "Merging with public companies presents\na special problem for us. If we are to offer\nany\npremium to the\nacquiree, one of two conditions must be present: Either our own stock must\nbe overvalued relative to the acquiree's, or the two companies together\nmust be expected to earn more than they would if operated separately. Historically,\nBerkshire has seldom been overvalued. In this market, moreover, undervalued\nacquirees are almost impossible to find. That other possibility -- synergy\ngains -- is usually unrealistic, since we expect acquirees to operate after\nwe've bought them just as they did before. Joining with Berkshire does\nnot normally raise their revenues nor cut their costs.\n\nIndeed, their reported costs (but\nnot their true ones) will\nrise\nafter they are bought by Berkshire\nif the acquiree has been granting options as part of its compensation packages.\nIn these cases, \"earnings\" of the acquiree have been overstated\nbecause they have followed the standard -- but, in our view, dead wrong\n-- accounting practice of ignoring the cost to a business of issuing options.\nWhen Berkshire acquires an option-issuing company, we promptly substitute\na cash compensation plan having an economic value equivalent to that of\nthe previous option plan. The acquiree's true compensation cost is thereby\nbrought out of the closet and charged, as it should be, against earnings.\n\nThe reasoning that Berkshire applies\nto the merger of public companies\nshould\nbe the calculus for all\nbuyers. Paying a takeover premium does not make sense for any acquirer\nunless a) its stock is overvalued relative to the acquiree's or b) the\ntwo enterprises will earn more combined than they would separately. Predictably,\nacquirers normally hew to the second argument because very few are willing\nto acknowledge that their stock is overvalued. However, voracious buyers\n-- the ones that issue shares as fast as they can print them -- are tacitly\nconceding that point. (Often, also, they are running Wall Street's version\nof a chain-letter scheme.)\n\nIn some mergers there truly are\nmajor synergies -- though oftentimes the acquirer pays too much to obtain\nthem -- but at other times the cost and revenue benefits that are projected\nprove illusory. Of one thing, however, be certain: If a CEO is enthused\nabout a particularly foolish acquisition, both his internal staff and his\noutside advisors will come up with whatever projections are needed to justify\nhis stance. Only in fairy tales are emperors told that they are naked.",

In these, we significantly\nreduced a few of our holdings that are below the $750 million threshold\nfor itemization, and we also modestly trimmed a few of the larger positions\nthat we detail. Some of the sales we made during 1997 were aimed at changing\nour bond-stock ratio moderately in response to the relative values that\nwe saw in each market, a realignment we have continued in 1998.\n\nOur reported positions, we should\nadd, sometimes reflect the investment decisions of GEICO's Lou Simpson.\nLou independently runs an equity portfolio of nearly $2 billion that may\nat times overlap the portfolio that I manage, and occasionally he makes\nmoves that differ from mine.\n\nThough we don't attempt to predict\nthe movements of the stock market, we do try, in a very rough way, to value\nit. At the annual meeting last year, with the Dow at 7,071 and long-term\nTreasury yields at 6.89%, Charlie and I stated that we did not consider\nthe market overvalued\nif\n1) interest rates remained where they were\nor fell, and 2) American business continued to earn the remarkable returns\non equity that it had recently recorded. So far, interest rates have fallen\n-- that's one requisite satisfied -- and returns on equity still remain\nexceptionally high. If they stay there -- and if interest rates hold near\nrecent levels -- there is no reason to think of stocks as generally overvalued.\nOn the other hand, returns on equity are not a sure thing to remain at,\nor even near, their present levels.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, when equities\nlooked cheap to me, I wrote a\nForbes\narticle entitled \"You\npay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\"\nAt that time skepticism and disappointment prevailed, and my point was\nthat investors should be glad of the fact, since pessimism drives down\nprices to truly attractive levels. Now, however, we have a very cheery\nconsensus. That does not necessarily mean this is the wrong time to buy\nstocks: Corporate America is now earning far more money than it was just\na few years ago, and in the presence of lower interest rates, every dollar\nof earnings becomes more valuable. Today's price levels, though, have materially\neroded the \"margin of safety\" that Ben Graham identified as the\ncornerstone of intelligent investing.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *",

An excerpt from one\nhandwritten note he sent to me illustrates his mind-set: \"By the way,\nI have told Olguita that what she refers to as an obsession, you call focus.\nI like your term much better.\" Like all who knew Roberto, I will miss\nhim enormously.\n\nConsistent with his concern for\nthe company, Roberto prepared for a seamless succession long before it\nseemed necessary.

    "content": "Two years ago, I gave you an update\non the five convertible preferreds that we purchased through private placements\nin the 1987-1991 period. At the time of that earlier report, we had realized\na small profit on the sale of our Champion International holding. The four\nremaining preferred commitments included two, Gillette and First Empire\nState, that we had converted into common stock in which we had large unrealized\ngains, and two others, USAir and Salomon, that had been trouble-prone.\nAt times, the last two had me mouthing a line from a country song: \"How\ncan I miss you if you won't go away?\"\n\nSince I delivered that report,\nall four holdings have grown significantly in value. The common stocks\nof both Gillette and First Empire have risen substantially, in line with\nthe companies' excellent performance. At yearend, the $600 million we put\ninto Gillette in 1989 had appreciated to $4.8 billion, and the $40 million\nwe committed to First Empire in 1991 had risen to $236 million.\n\nOur two laggards, meanwhile, have\ncome to life in a very major way. In a transaction that finally rewarded\nits long-suffering shareholders, Salomon recently merged into Travelers\nGroup. All of Berkshire's shareholders -- including me, very personally\n-- owe a huge debt to Deryck Maughan and Bob Denham for, first, playing\nkey roles in saving Salomon from extinction following its 1991 scandal\nand, second, restoring the vitality of the company to a level that made\nit an attractive acquisition for Travelers. I have often said that I wish\nto work with executives that I like, trust and admire. No two fit that\ndescription better than Deryck and Bob.\n\nBerkshire's final results from\nits Salomon investment won't be tallied for some time, but it is safe to\nsay that they will be far better than I anticipated two years ago. Looking\nback, I think of my Salomon experience as having been both fascinating\nand instructional, though for a time in 1991-92 I felt like the drama critic\nwho wrote: \"I would have enjoyed the play except that I had an unfortunate\nseat. It faced the stage.\"\n\nThe resuscitation of US Airways\nborders on the miraculous. Those who have watched my moves in this investment\nknow that I have compiled a record that is unblemished by success. I was\nwrong in originally purchasing the stock, and I was wrong later, in repeatedly\ntrying to unload our holdings at 50 cents on the dollar.\n\nTwo changes at the company coincided\nwith its remarkable rebound: 1) Charlie and I left the board of directors\nand 2) Stephen Wolf became CEO. Fortunately for our egos, the second event\nwas the key: Stephen Wolf's accomplishments at the airline have been phenomenal.\n\nThere still is much to do at US\nAirways, but survival is no longer an issue. Consequently, the company\nmade up the dividend arrearages on our preferred during 1997, adding extra\npayments to compensate us for the delay we suffered. The company's common\nstock, furthermore, has risen from a low of $4 to a recent high of $73.",

But the rise in the company's stock has given our\nconversion rights, which we thought worthless not long ago, great value.\nIt is now almost certain that our US Airways shares will produce a decent\nprofit -- that is, if my cost for Maalox is excluded -- and the gain could\neven prove indecent.\n\nNext time I make a big, dumb decision,\nBerkshire shareholders will know what to do:\nPhone Mr. Wolf\n.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nIn addition to the convertible\npreferreds, we purchased one other private placement in 1991, $300 million\nof American Express Percs. This security was essentially a common stock\nthat featured a tradeoff in its first three years: We received extra dividend\npayments during that period, but we were also capped in the price appreciation\nwe could realize. Despite the cap, this holding has proved extraordinarily\nprofitable thanks to a move by your Chairman that combined luck and skill\n-- 110% luck, the balance skill.\n\nOur Percs were due to convert into\ncommon stock in August 1994, and in the month before I was mulling whether\nto sell upon conversion. One reason to hold was Amex's outstanding CEO,\nHarvey Golub, who seemed likely to maximize whatever potential the company\nhad (a supposition that has since been proved -- in spades). But the size\nof that potential was in question: Amex faced relentless competition from\na multitude of card-issuers, led by Visa. Weighing the arguments, I leaned\ntoward sale.\n\nHere's where I got lucky. During\nthat month of decision, I played golf at Prouts Neck, Maine with Frank\nOlson, CEO of Hertz. Frank is a brilliant manager, with intimate knowledge\nof the card business. So from the first tee on I was quizzing him about\nthe industry. By the time we reached the second green, Frank had convinced\nme that Amex's corporate card was a terrific franchise, and I had decided\nnot to sell. On the back nine I turned buyer, and in a few months Berkshire\nowned 10% of the company.\n\nWe now have a $3 billion gain in\nour Amex shares, and I naturally feel very grateful to Frank. But George\nGillespie, our mutual friend, says that I am confused about where my gratitude\nshould go. After all, he points out, it was he who arranged the game and\nassigned me to Frank's foursome.",

Relatively few\nshareholders responded, but it is clear that at least a small number who\nwant the quarterly information have no interest in getting it off the Internet.\nBeing a life-long sufferer from technophobia, I can empathize with this\ngroup.\n\nThe cost of publishing quarterlies,\nhowever, continues to balloon, and we have therefore decided to send printed\nversions only to shareholders who request them. If you wish the quarterlies,\nplease complete the reply card that is bound into this report. In the meantime,\nbe assured that\nall\nshareholders will continue to receive the\nannual\n\nreport in printed form.\n\nThose of you who enjoy the computer\nshould check out our home page. It contains a large amount of current information\nabout Berkshire and also all of our annual letters since 1977. In addition,\nour website includes links to the home pages of many Berkshire subsidiaries.\nOn these sites you can learn more about our subsidiaries' products and\n-- yes -- even place orders for them.\n\nWe are required to file our quarterly\ninformation with the SEC no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter.\nOne of our goals in posting communications on the Internet is to make this\nmaterial information -- in full detail and in a form unfiltered by the\nmedia -- simultaneously available to all interested parties at a time when\nmarkets are closed. Accordingly, we plan to send our 1998 quarterly information\nto the SEC on three Fridays, May 15, August 14, and November 13, and on\nthose nights to post the same information on the Internet. This procedure\nwill put all of our shareholders, whether they be direct or \"street-name,\"\non an equal footing.

    "content": "Woodstock Weekend at Berkshire\nwill be May 2-4 this year. The finale will be the annual meeting, which\nwill begin at 9: 30 a. m. on Monday, May 4. Last year we met at Aksarben\nColiseum, and both our staff and the crowd were delighted with the venue.\nThere was only one crisis: The night before the meeting, I lost my voice,\nthereby fulfilling Charlie's wildest fantasy. He was crushed when I showed\nup the next morning with my speech restored.\n\nLast year about 7,500 attended\nthe meeting. They represented all 50 states, as well as 16 countries, including\nAustralia, Brazil, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Greece. Taking into\naccount several overflow rooms, we believe that we can handle more than\n11,000 people, and that should put us in good shape this year even though\nour shareholder count has risen significantly. Parking is ample at Aksarben;\nacoustics are excellent; and seats are comfortable.\n\nThe doors will open at 7 a. m. on\nMonday and at 8: 30 we will again feature the world premiere of a movie\nepic produced by Marc Hamburg, our CFO. The meeting will last until 3: 30,\nwith a short break at noon. This interval will permit the exhausted to\nleave unnoticed and allow time for the hardcore to lunch at Aksarben's\nconcession stands. Charlie and I enjoy questions from owners, so bring\nup whatever is on your mind.\n\nBerkshire products will again be\n\nfor sale\nin the halls outside the meeting room. Last year -- not\nthat I pay attention to this sort of thing -- we again set sales records,\nmoving 2,500 pounds of See's candy, 1,350 pairs of Dexter shoes, $75,000\nof World Books and related publications, and 888 sets of Quikut knives.\nWe also took orders for a new line of apparel, featuring our Berkshire\nlogo, and sold about 1,000 polo, sweat, and T-shirts. At this year's meeting,\nwe will unveil our 1998 collection.\n\nGEICO will again be on hand with\na booth staffed by star associates from its regional offices. Find out\nwhether you can save money by shifting your auto insurance to GEICO. About\n40% of those who check us out learn that savings are possible. The proportion\nis not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with\nsome favoring drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work at\ncertain occupations more than we do. We believe, however, that we more\nfrequently offer the low price than does any other national carrier selling\ninsurance to all comers. In the GEICO informational material that accompanies\nthis report, you will see that in 38 states we now offer a special discount\nof as much as 8% to our shareholders. We also have applications pending\nthat would extend this discount to drivers in other states.",

    "content": "An attachment to the proxy material\nthat is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the card\nyou will need for admission to the meeting. We expect a large crowd, so\nget plane, hotel and car reservations promptly. American Express (800-799-6634)\nwill be happy to help you with arrangements. As usual, we will have buses\nat the larger hotels that will take you to and from the meeting and also\ndeliver you to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the airport after\nits conclusion. You are likely, however, to find a car handy.\n\nNFM's main store, located on a\n75-acre site about a mile from Aksarben, is open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m.\non weekdays, 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on Saturdays, and noon to 6 p. m. on Sundays.\nDuring the period from May 1 to May 5, shareholders who present NFM with\nthe coupon that will accompany their meeting ticket will be entitled to\na discount that is otherwise restricted to its employees.\n\nBorsheim's normally is closed on\nSunday but will be open for shareholders from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on May\n3 rd. Last year was our second-best shareholder's day, exceeded only by\n1996's. I regard this slippage as an anomaly and hope that you will prove\nme right this year. Charlie will be available for autographs. He smiles,\nhowever, only if the paper he signs is a Borsheim's sales ticket. Shareholders\nwho wish to visit on Saturday (10 a. m. to 5: 30 p. m.) or on Monday (10 a. m.-8\np. m.) should be sure to identify themselves as Berkshire owners so that\nSusan Jacques, Borsheim's CEO, can make you especially welcome. Susan,\nI should add, had a fabulous year in 1997. As a manager, she is everything\nthat an owner hopes for.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon we will also\nhave a special treat for bridge players in the mall outside of Borsheim's.\nThere, Bob Hamman -- a legend of the game for more than three decades --\nwill take on all comers. Join in and dazzle Bob with your skill.\n\nMy favorite steakhouse, Gorat's,\nopens one Sunday a year -- for Berkshire shareholders on the night before\nthe annual meeting. Last year the restaurant started serving at 4 p. m.\nand finished about 1: 30 a. m, an endurance trial that was the result of\ntaking 1,100 reservations vs. a seating capacity of 235. If you make a\nreservation and then can't attend, be sure to let Gorat's know promptly,\nsince it goes to great effort to help us and we want to reciprocate. You\ncan make reservations beginning on April 1 st (\nbut not before\n) by\ncalling 402-551-3733. Last year I had to leave Gorat's a little early because\nof my voice problem, but this year I plan to leisurely savor every bite\nof my rare T-bone and double order of hash browns.",

    "content": "After this warmup, Charlie and\nI will head for the Dairy Queen on 114 th, just south of Dodge. There are\n12 great Dairy Queens in metropolitan Omaha, but the 114 th Street location\nis the best suited to handle the large crowd that we expect. South of the\nproperty, there are hundreds of parking spaces on both sides of the street.\nAlso, this Dairy Queen will extend its Sunday hours to 11 p. m. in order\nto accommodate our shareholders.\n\nThe 114 th Street operation is now\nrun by two sisters, Coni Birge and Deb Novotny, whose grandfather put up\nthe building in 1962 at what was then the outer edge of the city. Their\nmother, Jan Noble, took over in 1972, and Coni and Deb continue as third\ngeneration owner-managers. Jan, Coni and Deb will all be on hand Sunday\nevening, and I hope that you meet them. Enjoy one of their hamburgers if\nyou can't get into Gorat's. And then, around eight o'clock, join me in\nhaving a Dusty Sundae for dessert. This item is a personal specialty --\nthe Dairy Queen will furnish you a copy of my recipe -- and will be offered\nonly on Shareholder Sunday.\n\nThe Omaha Royals and Albuquerque\nDukes will play baseball on Saturday evening, May 2 nd, at Rosenblatt Stadium.\nAs usual, your Chairman, shamelessly exploiting his 25% ownership of the\nteam, will take the mound. But this year you will see something new.\n\nIn past games, much to the bafflement\nof the crowd, I have shaken off the catcher's first call. He has consistently\nasked for my sweeping curve, and I have just as regularly resisted. Instead,\nI have served up a pathetic fast ball, which on my best day was clocked\nat eight miles per hour (with a following wind).\n\nThere's a story behind my unwillingness\nto throw the curve ball. As some of you may know, Candy Cummings invented\nthe curve in 1867 and used it to great effect in the National Association,\nwhere he never won less than 28 games in a season. The pitch, however,\ndrew immediate criticism from the very highest of authorities, namely Charles\nElliott, then president of Harvard University, who declared, \"I have\nheard that this year we at Harvard won the baseball championship because\nwe have a pitcher who has a fine curve ball. I am further instructed that\nthe purpose of the curve ball is to deliberately deceive the batter. Harvard\nis not in the business of teaching deception.\" (I'm not making this\nup.)\n\nEver since I learned of President\nElliott's moral teachings on this subject, I have scrupulously refrained\nfrom using my curve, however devastating its effect might have been on\nhapless batters. Now, however, it is time for my karma to run over Elliott's\ndogma and for me to quit holding back. Visit the park on Saturday night\nand marvel at the majestic arc of my breaking ball.\n\nOur proxy statement includes information\nabout obtaining tickets to the game. We will also provide an information\npacket describing the local hot spots, including, of course, those 12 Dairy\nQueens.\n\nCome to Omaha -- the cradle of\ncapitalism -- in May and enjoy yourself.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 27,1998 Chairman of the Board",
