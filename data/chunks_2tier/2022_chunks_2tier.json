We are grateful for their enduring trust, a relationship that often spans\nmuch of their adult lifetime. It is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as I write\nthis letter.\nA common belief is that people choose to save when young, expecting thereby to maintain\ntheir living standards after retirement. Any assets that remain at death, this theory says, will usually\nbe left to their families or, possibly, to friends and philanthropy.\nOur experience has differed. We believe Berkshire’s individual holders largely to be of the\nonce-a-saver, always-a-saver variety. Though these people live well, they eventually dispense\nmost of their funds to philanthropic organizations. These, in turn, redistribute the funds by\nexpenditures intended to improve the lives of a great many people who are unrelated to the original\nbenefactor. Sometimes, the results have been spectacular.\nThe disposition of money unmasks humans. Charlie and I watch with pleasure the vast flow\nof Berkshire-generated funds to public needs and, alongside, the infrequency with which our\nshareholders opt for look-at-me assets and dynasty-building.\nWho wouldn’t enjoy working for shareholders like ours?",

    "content": "What We Do\nCharlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership.\nFirst, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each. Berkshire directs\ncapital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make day-by-day operating\ndecisions. When large enterprises are being managed, both trust and rules are essential. Berkshire\nemphasizes the former to an unusual – some would say extreme – degree. Disappointments are\ninevitable. We are understanding about business mistakes; our tolerance for personal misconduct\nis zero.\nIn our second category of ownership, we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we\npassively own pieces of businesses. Holding these investments, we have no say in management.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nOur goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with\nboth long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please note\nparticularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term\nbusiness performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That\npoint is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\nOver the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of\nbusinesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many\nthat enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way,\nother businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public.\nCapitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently\ndelivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon “creative\ndestruction.”\nOne advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to\nbuy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often\ntrade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. In\ntruth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in\nretrospect.\nControlled businesses are a different breed. They sometimes command ridiculously higher\nprices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations. Unless under duress, the\nowner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panic-type valuation.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management,\nmost of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so. In some cases, also, bad\nmoves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck. (Remember our escapes from\nnear-disasters at USAir and Salomon? I certainly do.)\nOur satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions – that\nwould be about one every five years – and a sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term\ninvestors such as Berkshire. Let’s take a peek behind the curtain.",

    "content": "The Secret Sauce\nIn August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400\nmillion shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful\nsum at Berkshire.\nThe cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend\nhad increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie\nand I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks\nare highly likely to grow.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nAmerican Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially\ncompleted in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this\ninvestment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely\nto increase.\nThese dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them\nimportant gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while\nAmex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net\nworth, akin to its weighting long ago.\nAssume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990 s, one\nthat flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a\nhigh-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant\n0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of\nannual income.\nThe lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom.\nOver time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live\ninto your 90 s as well.",

    "content": "The Past Year in Brief\nBerkshire had a good year in 2022. The company’s operating earnings – our term for\nincome calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), exclusive of\ncapital gains or losses from equity holdings – set a record at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus on\nthis operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment,\nfluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date. Note its acrobatic behavior in 2022,\nwhich is in no way unusual:\n[TABLE — see child chunk 2022-S04-T2-001]\nThe GAAP earnings are 100% misleading when viewed quarterly or even annually. Capital\ngains, to be sure, have been hugely important to Berkshire over past decades, and we expect them\nto be meaningfully positive in future decades. But their quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly and\nmindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nA second positive development for Berkshire last year was our purchase of Alleghany\nCorporation, a property-casualty insurer captained by Joe Brandon. I’ve worked with Joe in the\npast, and he understands both Berkshire and insurance. Alleghany delivers special value to\nus because Berkshire’s unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to follow\nvaluable and enduring investment strategies unavailable to virtually all competitors.\nAided by Alleghany, our insurance float increased during 2022 from $147 billion to $164\nbillion. With disciplined underwriting, these funds have a decent chance of being cost-free over\ntime. Since purchasing our first property-casualty insurer in 1967, Berkshire’s float has increased\n8,000-fold through acquisitions, operations and innovations. Though not recognized in our\nfinancial statements, this float has been an extraordinary asset for Berkshire. New shareholders\ncan get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float on\npage A-2.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA very minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share\nrepurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investees\nof ours. At Berkshire, we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses by\nrepurchasing 1.2% of the company’s outstanding shares. At Apple and Amex, repurchases\nincreased Berkshire’s ownership a bit without any cost to us.\nThe math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many\nbusinesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices. Just\nas surely, when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose. At such\ntimes, gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly, but expensive, investment\nbanker who recommended the foolish purchases.\nGains from value-accretive repurchases, it should be emphasized, benefit all owners – in\nevery respect. Imagine, if you will, three fully-informed shareholders of a local auto dealership,\none of whom manages the business. Imagine, further, that one of the passive owners wishes to sell\nhis interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders. When\ncompleted, has this transaction harmed anyone? Is the manager somehow favored over the\ncontinuing passive owners? Has the public been hurt?\nWhen you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or\nparticularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a\nsilver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

These pages are not, however, required reading. There are many\nBerkshire centimillionaires and, yes, billionaires who have never studied our financial figures.\nThey simply know that Charlie and I – along with our families and close friends – continue to have\nvery significant investments in Berkshire, and they trust us to treat their money as we do our own.\nAnd that is a promise we can make.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFinally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily\nbe manipulated by managers who wish to do so. Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated\nby CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well.\nBeating “expectations” is heralded as a managerial triumph.\nThat activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire\nto deceive is required. “Bold imaginative accounting,” as a CEO once described his deception to\nme, has become one of the shames of capitalism.\n58 Years – and a Few Figures\nIn 1965, Berkshire was a one-trick pony, the owner of a venerable – but doomed – New\nEngland textile operation. With that business on a death march, Berkshire needed an immediate\nfresh start. Looking back, I was slow to recognize the severity of its problems.\nAnd then came a stroke of good luck: National Indemnity became available in 1967, and\nwe shifted our resources toward insurance and other non-textile operations.\nThus began our journey to 2023, a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous\nsavings by our owners (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, our\navoidance of major mistakes and – most important of all – the American Tailwind. America would\nhave done fine without Berkshire. The reverse is not true.\nBerkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified\nbusinesses. Let’s first look at the 5,000 or so publicly-held companies that trade daily on\nNASDAQ, the NYSE and related venues. Within this group is housed the members of the S&P\n500 Index, an elite collection of large and well-known American companies.\nIn aggregate, the 500 earned $1.8 trillion in 2021. I don’t yet have the final results for 2022.\nUsing, therefore, the 2021 figures, only 128 of the 500 (including Berkshire itself) earned $3 billion\nor more. Indeed, 23 lost money.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nAt yearend 2022, Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants: American\nExpress, Bank of America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, HP Inc., Moody’s, Occidental Petroleum and\nParamount Global.\nIn addition to those eight investees, Berkshire owns 100% of BNSF and 92% of BH\nEnergy, each with earnings that exceed the $3 billion mark noted above ($5.9 billion at BNSF and\n$4.3 billion at BHE). Were these companies publicly-owned, they would replace two present\nmembers of the 500. All told, our ten controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave Berkshire\nmore broadly aligned with the country’s economic future than is the case at any other U. S.\ncompany. (This calculation leaves aside “fiduciary” operations such as pension funds and\ninvestment companies.) In addition, Berkshire’s insurance operation, though conducted through\nmany individually-managed subsidiaries, has a value comparable to BNSF or BHE.\nAs for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U. S. Treasury bills\nalong with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any\nuncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedented\ninsurance losses. Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer – a task it is irresponsible to\ndelegate. Additionally, our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshire\nshares, bought with their own money. And yes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper\nby retaining earnings.\nAt Berkshire, there will be no finish line.",

    "content": "Some Surprising Facts About Federal Taxes\nDuring the decade ending in 2021, the United States Treasury received about $32.3 trillion\nin taxes while it spent $43.9 trillion.\nThough economists, politicians and many of the public have opinions about the\nconsequences of that huge imbalance, Charlie and I plead ignorance and firmly believe that\nnear-term economic and market forecasts are worse than useless. Our job is to manage Berkshire’s\noperations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that will\npreserve the company’s unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwide\nrecessions occur. Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation, but this\nattribute is far from perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences.\nThe $32 trillion of revenue was garnered by the Treasury through individual income taxes\n⁄ ⁄\n(48%), social security and related receipts (341 %), corporate income tax payments (81 %) and a\n2 2\nwide variety of lesser levies. Berkshire’s contribution via the corporate income tax was $32 billion\nduring the decade, almost exactly a tenth of 1% of all money that the Treasury collected.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nAnd that means – brace yourself – had there been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U. S.\nmatching Berkshire’s payments, no other businesses nor any of the country’s 131 million\nhouseholds would have needed to pay any taxes to the federal government. Not a dime.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMillions, billions, trillions – we all know the words, but the sums involved are almost\nimpossible to comprehend. Let’s put physical dimensions to the numbers:\n• If you convert $1 million into newly-printed $100 bills, you will have a stack that reaches\nyour chest.\n• Perform the same exercise with $1 billion – this is getting exciting! – and the stack reaches\n⁄\nabout 3 of a mile into the sky.\n• Finally, imagine piling up $32 billion, the total of Berkshire’s 2012-21 federal income tax\npayments. Now the stack grows to more than 21 miles in height, about three times the level\nat which commercial airplanes usually cruise.\nWhen it comes to federal taxes, individuals who own Berkshire can unequivocally state “I\ngave at the office.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt Berkshire we hope and expect to pay much more in taxes during the next decade. We\nowe the country no less: America’s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever success\nBerkshire has achieved – a contribution Berkshire will always need. We count on the American\nTailwind and, though it has been becalmed from time to time, its propelling force has always\nreturned.\nI have been investing for 80 years – more than one-third of our country’s lifetime. Despite\nour citizens’ penchant – almost enthusiasm – for self-criticism and self-doubt, I have yet to see a\ntime when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America. And I doubt very much that\nany reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future.",

    "content": "Nothing Beats Having a Great Partner\nCharlie and I think pretty much alike. But what it takes me a page to explain, he sums up\nin a sentence. His version, moreover, is always more clearly reasoned and also more\nartfully – some might add bluntly – stated.\nHere are a few of his thoughts, many lifted from a very recent podcast:\n• The world is full of foolish gamblers, and they will not do as well as the patient investor.\n• If you don’t see the world the way it is, it’s like judging something through a distorted lens.\n• All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there. And a related thought:\nEarly on, write your desired obituary – and then behave accordingly.\n• If you don’t care whether you are rational or not, you won’t work on it. Then you will stay\nirrational and get lousy results.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n• Patience can be learned. Having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one\nthing for a long time is a huge advantage.\n• You can learn a lot from dead people. Read of the deceased you admire and detest.\n• Don’t bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy.\n• A great company keeps working after you are not; a mediocre company won’t do that.\n• Warren and I don’t focus on the froth of the market. We seek out good long-term\ninvestments and stubbornly hold them for a long time.\n• Ben Graham said, “Day to day, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term it’s\na weighing machine.” If you keep making something more valuable, then some wise person\nis going to notice it and start buying.\n• There is no such thing as a 100% sure thing when investing. Thus, the use of leverage is\ndangerous. A string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero. Don’t count\non getting rich twice.\n• You don’t, however, need to own a lot of things in order to get rich.\n• You have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor. When the world changes,\nyou must change.\n• Warren and I hated railroad stocks for decades, but the world changed and finally the\ncountry had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy. We were\nslow to recognize the change, but better late than never.\n• Finally, I will add two short sentences by Charlie that have been his decision-clinchers for\ndecades: “Warren, think more about it. You’re smart and I’m right.”\nAnd so it goes. I never have a phone call with Charlie without learning something. And,\nwhile he makes me think, he also makes me laugh.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI will add to Charlie’s list a rule of my own: Find a very smart high-grade\npartner – preferably slightly older than you – and then listen very carefully to what he says.",
