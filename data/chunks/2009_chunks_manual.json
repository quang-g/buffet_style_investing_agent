In this table, Berkshire’s resultsthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2",

Over the last 45 years (that is, since present management took over)book value has grown from $19 to $84,487, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.* Berkshire’s recent acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has added at least 65,000 shareholders to the 500,000 or so already on our books. It’s important to Charlie Munger, my long-time partner,and me that allof our owners understand Berkshire’s operations, goals, limitations and culture. In each annual report, consequently, we restate the economic principles that guide us. This year these principles appear on pages89-94 and I urge all of you – but particularly our new shareholders – to read them. Berkshire has adhered to theseprinciples for decades and will continue to do so long after I’m gone. In this letter we will also review some of the basics of our business, hoping to provide both a freshman orientation session for our BNSF newcomers and a refresher course for Berkshire veterans.",

From the start, Charlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have – or havenot – accomplished. That keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow of performance lands and then painting the bull’s eye around it. Selecting the S&P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can match its performance by holding an index fund. Why should they pay us for merely duplicating that result? A more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&P. There are good arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that isthe best test. But year-to-year market prices can be extraordinarily erratic. Even evaluations covering as long as adecade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurementperiod. Steve Ballmer, of Microsoft, and Jeff Immelt, of GE, can tell you about that problem, suffering as they dofrom the nosebleed prices at which their stocks traded when they were handed the managerial baton.",

The ideal standard for measuring our yearly progress would be the change in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value. Alas, that value cannot be calculated with anything close to precision, so we instead use a crude proxy forit: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93.Additionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case atBerkshire. In aggregate, our businesses are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried onour books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and Ibelieve that our book value – understated though it is – supplies the most useful tracking device for changes inintrinsic value. By this measurement, as the opening paragraph of this letter states, our book value since the startof fiscal 1965 has grown at a rate of 20.3% compounded annually. *All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares.

Surprisingly, this modestdifference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year periodcompared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965Berkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereastoday Berkshire shares regularly sell at a premium to the accounting values of its first-class businesses. Summed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First, we have never had anyfive-year period beginning with 1965-69 and ending with 2005-09 – and there have been 41 of these – during which our gain in book value did not exceed the S&P’s gain. Second, though we have laggedthe S&P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&P in theeleven years during which it delivered negative results.

    "chunk_text": "What We Don’t Do\n\nLong ago, Charlie laid out his strongest ambition: “All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.” That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled“Invert, always invert” as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approachworks on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house andwife.) Here are a few examples of how we apply Charlie’s thinking at Berkshire: • Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can’t evaluate, no matter how exciting their products may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growththat awaited such industries as autos (in 1910), aircraft (in 1930) and television sets (in 1950).

Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cashwe may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will beconstantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses. When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier of liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured$15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government forhelp. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secureAmerican businesses that needed – without delay – our tangible vote of confidence. The remaining $6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that wascompleted without pause while, elsewhere, panic reigned. 4 We pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength.

Among the 12,830 words in the annual letter was this sentence: “We are certain, for example, that the economy willbe in shambles throughout 2009 – and probably well beyond – but that conclusion does not tell uswhether the market will rise or fall.” Many news organizations reported – indeed, blared – the firstpart of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending.

We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion morethan their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our “Goodwill” account. These companies, however, areworth farmore than their carrying value – and the following look at the economic model of the P/C industry will tell you why. Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get toinvest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of floatwe hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so doesour float. If premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition, so vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.",

In my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I will absolutely state that we have the best managers. Our float has grown from $16 million in 1967, when we enteredthe business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit forseven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – thoughcertainly not all – future years. If we do so, our float will be cost-free, much as if someone deposited $62 billionwith us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest.

Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars toBerkshire’s value. It’s a pleasure for me to tell you about these all-stars. ************ Let’s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertising budget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18. Now 66, Tony still tap-dances to the office every day, just as I do at 79.We both feel lucky to work at a business we love. GEICO’s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here’s proof: Since Berkshire acquired control of GEICO in 1996, its market share has increased from 2.5% to 8.1%, a gain reflecting the netaddition of seven million policyholders.",

And they’ve stayed with us because they like our service as well as our price. Berkshire acquired GEICO in two stages. In 1976-80 we bought about one-third of the company’s stock for $47 million. Over the years, large repurchases by the company of its own shares caused our position togrow to about 50% without our having bought any more shares. Then, on January 2, 1996, we acquired theremaining 50% of GEICO for $2.3 billion in cash, about 50 times the cost of our original purchase. 6 An old Wall Street joke gets close to our experience: Customer: Thanks for putting me in XYZ stock at 5.

We shouldn’t expect our regulators to live up to their end of the bargain unless we live up to ours. Dave and Greg make sure we do just that.

Similarly, among the 43 U.S. pipelines ranked by a firmnamed Mastio, our Kern River and Northern Natural properties tied for second place. Moreover, we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare for the future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly.

MidAmerican has consistently kept its end of the bargain with society and, to society’s credit, it has reciprocated: With few exceptions, our regulators have promptly allowed us to earn a fair return on the ever-increasing sums of capital we must invest. Going forward, we will do whatever it takes to serve our territories inthe manner they expect. We believe that, in turn, we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds weinvest. In earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, the best businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require littleincremental investment to grow. We are fortunate to own a number of such businesses, and we would love to buymore.

Though the company’s sales were down 27%, Frank’s cost-conscious managementmitigated the decline in earnings. Nothing stops Israel-based Iscar – not wars, recessions or competitors. The world’s two other leading suppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of theyear. Though Iscar’s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, evenwhile it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about lastyear. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of EitanWertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny Goldman will see to that. Every business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely in 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and MiTek were $227 million, an82.5% decline from $1.295 billion in 2006, when construction activity was booming. These businesses continueto bump along the bottom, though their competitive positions remain undented. The major problem for Berkshire last year was NetJets, an aviation operation that offers fractional ownership of jets. Over the years, it has been enormously successful in establishing itself as the premier companyin its industry, with the value of its fleet far exceeding that of its three major competitors combined .",

Overall, our dominance in the field remains unchallenged. NetJets’ business operation, however, has been another story. In the eleven years that we have owned the company, it has recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million. Moreover, the company’s debt has soaredfrom $102 million at the time of purchase to $1.9 billion in April of last year. Without Berkshire’s guarantee ofthis debt, NetJets would have been out of business. It’s clear that I failed you in letting NetJets descend into thiscondition. But, luckily, I have been bailed out. 11 Dave Sokol, the enormously talented builder and operator of MidAmerican Energy, became CEO of NetJets in August. His leadership has been transforming: Debt has already been reduced to $1.4 billion, and, aftersuffering a staggering loss of $711 million in 2009, the company is now solidly profitable.

Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers wereFleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All havesince gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000 units in 1999 to 60,000 units in2009. The industry is in shambles for two reasons, the first of which must be lived with if the U.S. economy is to recover. This reason concerns U.S. housing starts (including apartment units). In 2009, starts were 554,000,by far the lowest number in the 50 years for which we have data. Paradoxically, this is good news. People thought it was good news a few years back when housing starts – the supply side of the picture – were running about two million annually. But household formations – the demand side – only amounted toabout 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too manyhouses. There were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the destruction of autos that occurred with the “cash-for-clunkers” program; (2) speed up household formations by,say, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reducenew housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations.",

Our country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residential housing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certainlocalities where overbuilding was particularly egregious. Prices will remain far below “bubble” levels, of course,but for every seller (or lender) hurt by this there will be a buyer who benefits. Indeed, many families that couldn’tafford to buy an appropriate home a few years ago now find it well within their means because the bubble burst. The second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive differential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes.

That warning made, however, let me explain why the rate differential causes problemsfor both large numbers of lower-income Americans and Clayton. The residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typicallybe securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers ofconventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 5 1⁄4%. In addition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, anaction that also helped to keep rates at bargain-basement levels. In contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a meritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton’shomes offer terrific value. If the buyer needs mortgage financing, however – and, of course, most buyers do – thedifference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factory-built home.",

Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it.Consequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren’tmaking “liar’s loans”) and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs, hadhealth problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simplybecause house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton’s delinquencies anddefaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems. We have tried to qualify more of our customers’ loans for treatment similar to those available on the site-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsiblehabits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to thefactory-built product makes monthly payments too expensive.

We entered 2008 with $44.3 billion of cash-equivalents, and we have since retained operating earnings of $17 billion. Nevertheless, at yearend 2009, our cash was down to $30.6 billion (with $8 billion earmarked forthe BNSF acquisition). We’ve put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years. It’s been anideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators areupbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.

The terms of about 10% of our equity put contracts have also changed: Maturities have been shortened and strike pricesmaterially reduced. In these modifications, no money changed hands. A few points from last year’s discussion are worth repeating: (1) Though it’s no sure thing, I expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime, even when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in thecalculation. Our derivatives float – which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float Idescribed earlier – was about $6.3 billion at yearend. (2) Only a handful of our contracts require us to post collateral under any circumstances. At last year’s low point in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of thederivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put upcontinue to earn money for our account. (3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affect our reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings.That thought certainly fit 2009’s circumstances.",

AtBerkshire nothing like that has occurred – nor will it. It’s my job to keep Berkshire far away from such problems. Charlie and I believe that a CEO must not delegate risk control. It’s simply too important. At Berkshire, I both initiate and monitor every derivatives contract on our books, with the exception of operations-related contracts at a few of our subsidiaries, such asMidAmerican, and the minor runoff contracts at General Re. If Berkshire ever gets in trouble, it will be myfault.

Charlie and I enjoy issuing Berkshire stock about as much as we relish prepping for a colonoscopy. The reason for our distaste is simple. If we wouldn’t dream of selling Berkshire in its entirety at the current market price, why in the world should we “sell” a significant part of the company at that same inadequateprice by issuing our stock in a merger? In evaluating a stock-for-stock offer, shareholders of the target company quite understandably focus on the market price of the acquirer’s shares that are to be given them. But they also expect the transaction to deliverthem the intrinsic value of their own shares – the ones they are giving up. If shares of a prospective acquirer are selling below their intrinsic value, it’s impossible for that buyer to make a sensible deal in an all-stock deal. Yousimply can’t exchange an undervalued stock for a fully-valued one without hurting your shareholders.

(No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there isplenty of private snickering.) In our BNSF acquisition, the selling shareholders quite properly evaluated our offer at $100 per share.

Fortunately, we had long owned a substantial amount ofBNSF stock that we purchased in the market for cash. All told, therefore, only about 30% of our cost overall waspaid with Berkshire shares.

With our shareholder population much expanded, we expect even more this year. Therefore,we will have to make a few changes in the usual routine. There will be no change, however, in our enthusiasmfor having you attend. Charlie and I like to meet you, answer your questions and – best of all – have you buylots of goods from our businesses. The meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 1 st. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to thequestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:30. After ashort recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’squestion periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.) The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square- foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries.",

We will again have a drawing at 8:15 on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those shareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists withthose from the winning shareholders. We’ve added 30 minutes to the question time and will probably have timefor about 30 questions from each group. *********** At 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams. We were born in America; had terrific parents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and cameequipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to thatexperienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being.",

Moreover, we havelong had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. Indeed,over the years, our work has become ever more fascinating; no wonder we tap-dance to work. If pushed, wewould gladly pay substantial sums to have our jobs (but don’t tell the Comp Committee). Nothing, however, is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting. So join us on May 1 stat the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. We’ll see you there. February 26, 2010 Warren E. Buffett Chairman of the Board P.S. Come by rail. 20",
