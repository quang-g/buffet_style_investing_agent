He argues that return on beginning equity is the better yardstick than earnings-per-share growth when capital is expanding, and he gives a cautious outlook for 1978 as underwriting margins likely decline.",
    "content": "To the Stockholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOperating earnings in 1977 of $21,904,000, or $22.54 per\nshare, were moderately better than anticipated a year ago. Of\nthese earnings, $1.43 per share resulted from substantial\nrealized capital gains by Blue Chip Stamps which, to the extent\nof our proportional interest in that company, are included in our\noperating earnings figure. Capital gains or losses realized\ndirectly by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. or its insurance subsidiaries\nare not included in our calculation of operating earnings. While\ntoo much attention should not be paid to the figure for any\nsingle year, over the longer term the record regarding aggregate\ncapital gains or losses obviously is of significance.\n\nTextile operations came in well below forecast, while the\nresults of the Illinois National Bank as well as the operating\nearnings attributable to our equity interest in Blue Chip Stamps\nwere about as anticipated. However, insurance operations, led\nagain by the truly outstanding results of Phil Liesches\nmanagerial group at National Indemnity Company, were even better\nthan our optimistic expectations.\n\nMost companies define record earnings as a new high in\nearnings per share. Since businesses customarily add from year\nto year to their equity base, we find nothing particularly\nnoteworthy in a management performance combining, say, a 10%\nincrease in equity capital and a 5% increase in earnings per\nshare. After all, even a totally dormant savings account will\nproduce steadily rising interest earnings each year because of\ncompounding.\n\nExcept for special cases (for example, companies with\nunusual debt-equity ratios or those with important assets carried\nat unrealistic balance sheet values), we believe a more\nappropriate measure of managerial economic performance to be\nreturn on equity capital. In 1977 our operating earnings on\nbeginning equity capital amounted to 19%, slightly better than\nlast year and above both our own long-term average and that of\nAmerican industry in aggregate. But, while our operating\nearnings per share were up 37% from the year before, our\nbeginning capital was up 24%, making the gain in earnings per\nshare considerably less impressive than it might appear at first\nglance.\n\nWe expect difficulty in matching our 1977 rate of return\nduring the forthcoming year. Beginning equity capital is up 23%\nfrom a year ago, and we expect the trend of insurance\nunderwriting profit margins to turn down well before the end of\nthe year. Nevertheless, we expect a reasonably good year and our\npresent estimate, subject to the usual caveats regarding the\nfrailties of forecasts, is that operating earnings will improve\nsomewhat on a per share basis during 1978.",

This may say something about our forecasting abilities,\nthe nature of the textile industry, or both. Despite strenuous\nefforts, problems in marketing and manufacturing have persisted.\nMany difficulties experienced in the marketing area are due\nprimarily to industry conditions, but some of the problems have\nbeen of our own making.\n\nA few shareholders have questioned the wisdom of remaining\nin the textile business which, over the longer term, is unlikely\nto produce returns on capital comparable to those available in\nmany other businesses. Our reasons are several: (1) Our mills in\nboth New Bedford and Manchester are among the largest employers\nin each town, utilizing a labor force of high average age\npossessing relatively non-transferable skills. Our workers and\nunions have exhibited unusual understanding and effort in\ncooperating with management to achieve a cost structure and\nproduct mix which might allow us to maintain a viable operation.\n(2) Management also has been energetic and straightforward in its\napproach to our textile problems. In particular, Ken Chaces\nefforts after the change in corporate control took place in 1965\ngenerated capital from the textile division needed to finance the\nacquisition and expansion of our profitable insurance operation.\n(3) With hard work and some imagination regarding manufacturing\nand marketing configurations, it seems reasonable that at least\nmodest profits in the textile division can be achieved in the\nfuture.",

    "content": "Insurance Underwriting\n\nOur insurance operation continued to grow significantly in\n1977. It was early in 1967 that we made our entry into this\nindustry through the purchase of National Indemnity Company and\nNational Fire and Marine Insurance Company (sister companies) for\napproximately $8.6 million. In that year their premium volume\namounted to $22 million. In 1977 our aggregate insurance premium\nvolume was $151 million. No additional shares of Berkshire\nHathaway stock have been issued to achieve any of this growth.\n\nRather, this almost 600% increase has been achieved through\nlarge gains in National Indemnitys traditional liability areas\nplus the starting of new companies (Cornhusker Casualty Company\nin 1970, Lakeland Fire and Casualty Company in 1971, Texas United\nInsurance Company in 1972, The Insurance Company of Iowa in 1973,\nand Kansas Fire and Casualty Company in late 1977), the purchase\nfor cash of other insurance companies (Home and Automobile\nInsurance Company in 1971, Kerkling Reinsurance Corporation, now\nnamed Central Fire and Casualty Company, in 1976, and Cypress\nInsurance Company at yearend 1977), and finally through the\nmarketing of additional products, most significantly reinsurance,\nwithin the National Indemnity Company corporate structure.\n\nIn aggregate, the insurance business has worked out very\nwell. But it hasnt been a one-way street. Some major mistakes\nhave been made during the decade, both in products and personnel.\nWe experienced significant problems from (1) a surety operation\ninitiated in 1969, (2) the 1973 expansion of Home and\nAutomobiles urban auto marketing into the Miami, Florida area,\n(3) a still unresolved aviation fronting arrangement, and (4)\nour Workers Compensation operation in California, which we\nbelieve retains an interesting potential upon completion of a\nreorganization now in progress. It is comforting to be in a\nbusiness where some mistakes can be made and yet a quite\nsatisfactory overall performance can be achieved. In a sense,\nthis is the opposite case from our textile business where even\nvery good management probably can average only modest results.\nOne of the lessons your management has learned - and,\nunfortunately, sometimes re-learned - is the importance of being\nin businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds.\n\nIn 1977 the winds in insurance underwriting were squarely\nbehind us. Very large rate increases were effected throughout\nthe industry in 1976 to offset the disastrous underwriting\nresults of 1974 and 1975. But, because insurance policies\ntypically are written for one-year periods, with pricing mistakes\ncapable of correction only upon renewal, it was 1977 before the\nfull impact was felt upon earnings of those earlier rate\nincreases.\n\nThe pendulum now is beginning to swing the other way. We\nestimate that costs involved in the insurance areas in which we\noperate rise at close to 1% per month. This is due to continuous\nmonetary inflation affecting the cost of repairing humans and\nproperty, as well as social inflation, a broadening definition\nby society and juries of what is covered by insurance policies.\nUnless rates rise at a comparable 1% per month, underwriting\nprofits must shrink. Recently the pace of rate increases has\nslowed dramatically, and it is our expectation that underwriting\nmargins generally will be declining by the second half of the\nyear.\n\nWe must again give credit to Phil Liesche, greatly assisted\nby Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims, for an\nextraordinary underwriting achievement in National Indemnitys\ntraditional auto and general liability business during 1977.\nLarge volume gains have been accompanied by excellent\nunderwriting margins following contraction or withdrawal by many\ncompetitors in the wake of the 1974-75 crisis period. These\nconditions will reverse before long. In the meantime, National\nIndemnitys underwriting profitability has increased dramatically\nand, in addition, large sums have been made available for\ninvestment. As markets loosen and rates become inadequate, we\nagain will face the challenge of philosophically accepting\nreduced volume. Unusual managerial discipline will be required,\nas it runs counter to normal institutional behavior to let the\nother fellow take away business - even at foolish prices.\n\nOur reinsurance department, managed by George Young,\nimproved its underwriting performance during 1977. Although the\ncombined ratio (see definition on page 12) of 107.1 was\nunsatisfactory, its trend was downward throughout the year. In\naddition, reinsurance generates unusually high funds for\ninvestment as a percentage of premium volume.\n\nAt Home and Auto, John Seward continued to make progress on\nall fronts. John was a battlefield promotion several years ago\nwhen Home and Autos underwriting was awash in red ink and the\ncompany faced possible extinction. Under his management it\ncurrently is sound, profitable, and growing.\n\nJohn Ringwalts homestate operation now consists of five\ncompanies, with Kansas Fire and Casualty Company becoming\noperational late in 1977 under the direction of Floyd Taylor.\nThe homestate companies had net premium volume of $23 million, up\nfrom $5.5 million just three years ago. All four companies that\noperated throughout the year achieved combined ratios below 100,\nwith Cornhusker Casualty Company, at 93.8, the leader. In\naddition to actively supervising the other four homestate\noperations, John Ringwalt manages the operations of Cornhusker\nwhich has recorded combined ratios below 100 in six of its seven\nfull years of existence and, from a standing start in 1970, has\ngrown to be one of the leading insurance companies operating in\nNebraska utilizing the conventional independent agency system.\nLakeland Fire and Casualty Company, managed by Jim Stodolka, was\nthe winner of the Chairmans Cup in 1977 for achieving the lowest\nloss ratio among the homestate companies. All in all, the\nhomestate operation continues to make excellent progress.\n\nThe newest addition to our insurance group is Cypress\nInsurance Company of South Pasadena, California. This Workers\nCompensation insurer was purchased for cash in the final days of\n1977 and, therefore, its approximate $12.5 million of volume for\nthat year was not included in our results. Cypress and National\nIndemnitys present California Workers Compensation operation\nwill not be combined, but will operate independently utilizing\nsomewhat different marketing strategies. Milt Thornton,\nPresident of Cypress since 1968, runs a first-class operation for\npolicyholders, agents, employees and owners alike. We look\nforward to working with him.\n\nInsurance companies offer standardized policies which can be\ncopied by anyone. Their only products are promises. It is not\ndifficult to be licensed, and rates are an open book. There are\nno important advantages from trademarks, patents, location,\ncorporate longevity, raw material sources, etc., and very little\nconsumer differentiation to produce insulation from competition.\nIt is commonplace, in corporate annual reports, to stress the\ndifference that people make. Sometimes this is true and\nsometimes it isnt. But there is no question that the nature of\nthe insurance business magnifies the effect which individual\nmanagers have on company performance. We are very fortunate to\nhave the group of managers that are associated with us.",

    "content": "Insurance Investments\n\nDuring the past two years insurance investments at cost\n(excluding the investment in our affiliate, Blue Chip Stamps)\nhave grown from $134.6 million to $252.8 million. Growth in\ninsurance reserves, produced by our large gain in premium volume,\nplus retained earnings, have accounted for this increase in\nmarketable securities. In turn, net investment income of the\nInsurance Group has improved from $8.4 million pre-tax in 1975 to\n$12.3 million pre-tax in 1977.\n\nIn addition to this income from dividends and interest, we\nrealized capital gains of $6.9 million before tax, about onequarter from bonds and the balance from stocks. Our unrealized\ngain in stocks at yearend 1977 was approximately $74 million but\nthis figure, like any other figure of a single date (we had an\nunrealized loss of $17 million at the end of 1974), should not be\ntaken too seriously. Most of our large stock positions are going\nto be held for many years and the scorecard on our investment\ndecisions will be provided by business results over that period,\nand not by prices on any given day. Just as it would be foolish\nto focus unduly on short-term prospects when acquiring an entire\ncompany, we think it equally unsound to become mesmerized by\nprospective near term earnings or recent trends in earnings when\npurchasing small pieces of a company; i. e., marketable common\nstocks.\n\nA little digression illustrating this point may be\ninteresting. Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway\nManufacturing were merged in 1955 to form Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\nIn 1948, on a pro forma combined basis, they had earnings after\ntax of almost $18 million and employed 10,000 people at a dozen\nlarge mills throughout New England. In the business world of\nthat period they were an economic powerhouse. For example, in\nthat same year earnings of IBM were $28 million (now $2.7\nbillion), Safeway Stores, $10 million, Minnesota Mining, $13\nmillion, and Time, Inc., $9 million. But, in the decade\nfollowing the 1955 merger aggregate sales of $595 million\nproduced an aggregate loss for Berkshire Hathaway of $10 million.\nBy 1964 the operation had been reduced to two mills and net worth\nhad shrunk to $22 million, from $53 million at the time of the\nmerger. So much for single year snapshots as adequate portrayals\nof a business.\n\nEquity holdings of our insurance companies with a market\nvalue of over $5 million on December 31,1977 were as follows:\n\nNo. of Shares Company Cost Market\n------------- ------- -------- --------\n(000 s omitted)\n\n220,000 Capital Cities Communications, Inc. ..... $ 10,909 $ 13,228\n1,986,953 Government Employees Insurance\nCompany Convertible Preferred ........ 19,417 33,033\n1,294,308 Government Employees Insurance\nCompany Common Stock ................. 4,116 10,516\n592,650 The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. 4,531 17,187\n324,580 Kaiser Aluminum& Chemical Corporation ... 11,218 9,981\n1,305,800 Kaiser Industries, Inc. ................. 778 6,039\n226,900 Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc. .......... 7,534 8,736\n170,800 Ogilvy & Mather International, Inc. ..... 2,762 6,960\n934,300 The Washington Post Company Class B ..... 10,628 33,401\n-------- --------\nTotal ................................... $ 71,893 $139,081\nAll Other Holdings ...................... 34,996 41,992\n-------- --------\nTotal Equities .......................... $106,889 $181,073\n======== ========\n\nWe select our marketable equity securities in much the same\nway we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety.\nWe want the business to be (1) one that we can understand, (2)\nwith favorable long-term prospects, (3) operated by honest and\ncompetent people, and (4) available at a very attractive price.\nWe ordinarily make no attempt to buy equities for anticipated\nfavorable stock price behavior in the short term. In fact, if\ntheir business experience continues to satisfy us, we welcome\nlower market prices of stocks we own as an opportunity to acquire\neven more of a good thing at a better price.\n\nOur experience has been that pro-rata portions of truly\noutstanding businesses sometimes sell in the securities markets\nat very large discounts from the prices they would command in\nnegotiated transactions involving entire companies.\nConsequently, bargains in business ownership, which simply are\nnot available directly through corporate acquisition, can be\nobtained indirectly through stock ownership. When prices are\nappropriate, we are willing to take very large positions in\nselected companies, not with any intention of taking control and\nnot foreseeing sell-out or merger, but with the expectation that\nexcellent business results by corporations will translate over\nthe long term into correspondingly excellent market value and\ndividend results for owners, minority as well as majority.\n\nSuch investments initially may have negligible impact on our\noperating earnings. For example, we invested $10.9 million in\nCapital Cities Communications during 1977. Earnings attributable\nto the shares we purchased totaled about $1.3 million last year.\nBut only the cash dividend, which currently provides $40,000\nannually, is reflected in our operating earnings figure.\n\nCapital Cities possesses both extraordinary properties and\nextraordinary management. And these management skills extend\nequally to operations and employment of corporate capital. To\npurchase, directly, properties such as Capital Cities owns would\ncost in the area of twice our cost of purchase via the stock\nmarket, and direct ownership would offer no important advantages\nto us. While control would give us the opportunity - and the\nresponsibility - to manage operations and corporate resources, we\nwould not be able to provide management in either of those\nrespects equal to that now in place. In effect, we can obtain a\nbetter management result through non-control than control. This\nis an unorthodox view, but one we believe to be sound.",

As usual, this record was achieved while the bank paid\nmaximum rates to savers and maintained an asset position\ncombining low risk and exceptional liquidity. Gene Abegg formed\nthe bank in 1931 with $250,000. In its first full year of\noperation, earnings amounted to $8,782. Since that time, no new\ncapital has been contributed to the bank; on the contrary, since\nour purchase in 1969, dividends of $20 million have been paid.\nEarnings in 1977 amounted to $3.6 million, more than achieved by\nmany banks two or three times its size.\n\nLate last year Gene, now 80 and still running a banking\noperation without peer, asked that a successor be brought in.\nAccordingly, Peter Jeffrey, formerly President and Chief\nExecutive Officer of American National Bank of Omaha, has joined\nthe Illinois National Bank effective March 1 st as President and\nChief Executive Officer.\n\nGene continues in good health as Chairman. We expect a\ncontinued successful operation at Rockfords leading bank.\n\nBlue Chip Stamps\n\nWe again increased our equity interest in Blue Chip Stamps,\nand owned approximately 36 1/2% at the end of 1977. Blue Chip\nhad a fine year, earning approximately $12.9 million from\noperations and, in addition, had realized securities gains of\n$4.1 million.\n\nBoth Wesco Financial Corp., an 80% owned subsidiary of Blue\nChip Stamps, managed by Louis Vincenti, and Sees Candies, a 99%\nowned subsidiary, managed by Chuck Huggins, made good progress in\n1977. Since Sees was purchased by Blue Chip Stamps at the\nbeginning of 1972, pre-tax operating earnings have grown from\n$4.2 million to $12.6 million with little additional capital\ninvestment. Sees achieved this record while operating in an\nindustry experiencing practically no unit growth.
