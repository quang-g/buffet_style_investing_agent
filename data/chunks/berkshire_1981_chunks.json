Beware of\ndividends that can be paid out only if someone promises to\nreplace the capital distributed.)\n\nBerkshire continues to retain its earnings for offensive,\nnot defensive or obligatory, reasons. But in no way are we\nimmune from the pressures that escalating passive returns exert\non equity capital. We continue to clear the crossbar of aftertax passive return - but barely. Our historic 21% return - not\nat all assured for the future - still provides, after the current\ncapital gain tax rate (which we expect to rise considerably in\nfuture years), a modest margin over current after-tax rates on\npassive money. It would be a bit humiliating to have our\ncorporate value-added turn negative. But it can happen here as\nit has elsewhere, either from events outside anyones control or\nfrom poor relative adaptation on our part.\n",

A copy of the letter sent October 14,1981 describing this program appears on pages 51-53. Of 932,206\nshares eligible for participation (shares where the name of the\nactual owner appeared on our stockholder record), 95.6%\nresponded. Even excluding Buffet-related shares, the response\ntopped 90%.\n\nIn addition, more than 3% of our shareholders voluntarily\nwrote letters or notes, all but one approving of the program.\nBoth the level of participation and of commentary surpass any\nshareholder response we have witnessed, even when such response\nhas been intensively solicited by corporate staff and highly paid\nprofessional proxy organizations. In contrast, your\nextraordinary level of response occurred without even the nudge\nof a company-provided return envelope. This self-propelled\nbehavior speaks well for the program, and speaks well for our\nshareholders.\n\nApparently the owners of our corporation like both\npossessing and exercising the ability to determine where gifts of\ntheir funds shall be made.
