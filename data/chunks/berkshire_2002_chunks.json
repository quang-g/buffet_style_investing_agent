    "chunk_text": "Opening Performance Summary\n\n\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 2002 was $6.1 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 10.0%. Over the last 38 years (that is, since present management\n∗\ntook over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $41,727, a rate of 22.2% compounded annually.\nIn all respects 2002 was a banner year. I’ll provide details later, but here’s a summary:\n• Our various non-insurance operations performed exceptionally well, despite a sluggish economy.\nA decade ago Berkshire’s annual pre-tax earnings from our non-insurance businesses was $272\nmillion. Now, from our ever-expanding collection of manufacturing, retailing, service and finance\nbusinesses, we earn that sum monthly.\n• Our insurance group increased its float to $41.2 billion, a hefty gain of $5.7 billion. Better yet, the\nuse of these funds in 2002 cost us only 1%. Getting back to low-cost float feels good, particularly\nafter our poor results during the three previous years. Berkshire’s reinsurance division and\nGEICO shot the lights out in 2002, and underwriting discipline was restored at General Re.\n• Berkshire acquired some important new businesses – with economic characteristics ranging from\ngood to great, run by managers ranging from great to great. Those attributes are two legs of our\n“entrance” strategy, the third being a sensible purchase price. Unlike LBO operators and private\nequity firms, we have no “exit” strategy – we buy to keep. That’s one reason why Berkshire is\nusually the first – and sometimes the only – choice for sellers and their managers.\n• Our marketable securities outperformed most indices. For Lou Simpson, who manages equities at\nGEICO, this was old stuff. But, for me, it was a welcome change from the last few years, during\nwhich my investment record was dismal.\nThe confluence of these favorable factors in 2002 caused our book-value gain to outstrip the\nperformance of the S&P 500 by 32.1 percentage points. This result is aberrational: Charlie Munger,\nBerkshire’s vice chairman and my partner, and I hope to achieve – at most – an average annual advantage\nof a few points. In the future, there will be years in which the S&P soundly trounces us. That will in fact\nalmost certainly happen during a strong bull market, because the portion of our assets committed to\ncommon stocks has significantly declined. This change, of course, helps our relative performance in down\nmarkets such as we had in 2002.\nI have another caveat to mention about last year’s results. If you’ve been a reader of financial\nreports in recent years, you’ve seen a flood of “pro-forma” earnings statements – tabulations in which\nmanagers invariably show “earnings” far in excess of those allowed by their auditors. In these\npresentations, the CEO tells his owners “don’t count this, don’t count that – just count what makes earnings\nfat.” Often, a forget-all-this-bad-stuff message is delivered year after year without management so much as\nblushing.\n∗\nAll figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that\nthe company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30 th that of\nthe A.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "chunk_text": "Opening Performance Summary\n\n\nWe’ve yet to see a pro-forma presentation disclosing that audited earnings were somewhat high.\nSo let’s make a little history: Last year, on a pro-forma basis, Berkshire had lower earnings than those we\nactually reported.\nThat is true because two favorable factors aided our reported figures. First, in 2002 there was no\nmegacatastrophe, which means that Berkshire (and other insurers as well) earned more from insurance than\nif losses had been normal. In years when the reverse is true – because of a blockbuster hurricane,\nearthquake or man-made disaster – many insurers like to report that they would have earned X “except for”\nthe unusual event. The implication is that since such megacats are infrequent, they shouldn’t be counted\nwhen “true” earnings are calculated. That is deceptive nonsense. “Except for” losses will forever be part\nof the insurance business, and they will forever be paid with shareholders’ money.\nNonetheless, for the purposes of this exercise, we’ll take a page from the industry’s book. For last\nyear, when we didn’t have any truly major disasters, a downward adjustment is appropriate if you wish to\n“normalize” our underwriting result.\nSecondly, the bond market in 2002 favored certain strategies we employed in our finance and\nfinancial products business. Gains from those strategies will certainly diminish within a year or two – and\nmay well disappear.\nSoooo . . . “except for” a couple of favorable breaks, our pre-tax earnings last year would have\nbeen about $500 million less than we actually reported. We’re happy, nevertheless, to bank the excess. As\nJack Benny once said upon receiving an award: “I don’t deserve this honor – but, then, I have arthritis, and\nI don’t deserve that either.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe continue to be blessed with an extraordinary group of managers, many of whom haven’t the\nslightest financial need to work. They stick around, though: In 38 years, we’ve never had a single CEO of\na subsidiary elect to leave Berkshire to work elsewhere. Counting Charlie, we now have six managers over\n75, and I hope that in four years that number increases by at least two (Bob Shaw and I are both 72). Our\nrationale: “It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.”\nBerkshire’s operating CEOs are masters of their crafts and run their businesses as if they were\ntheir own. My job is to stay out of their way and allocate whatever excess capital their businesses generate.\nIt’s easy work.\nMy managerial model is Eddie Bennett, who was a batboy. In 1919, at age 19, Eddie began his\nwork with the Chicago White Sox, who that year went to the World Series. The next year, Eddie switched\nto the Brooklyn Dodgers, and they, too, won their league title. Our hero, however, smelled trouble.\nChanging boroughs, he joined the Yankees in 1921, and they promptly won their first pennant in history.\nNow Eddie settled in, shrewdly seeing what was coming. In the next seven years, the Yankees won five\nAmerican League titles.\nWhat does this have to do with management? It’s simple – to be a winner, work with winners. In\n1927, for example, Eddie received $700 for the 1/8 th World Series share voted him by the legendary\nYankee team of Ruth and Gehrig. This sum, which Eddie earned by working only four days (because New\nYork swept the Series) was roughly equal to the full-year pay then earned by batboys who worked with\nordinary associates.\nEddie understood that how he lugged bats was unimportant; what counted instead was hooking up\nwith the cream of those on the playing field. I’ve learned from Eddie. At Berkshire, I regularly hand bats\nto many of the heaviest hitters in American business.",

Two acquisitions pending at yearend 2001 were\ncompleted: Albecca (which operates under the name Larson-Juhl), the U. S. leader in custom-made picture\nframes; and Fruit of the Loom, the producer of about 33.3% of the men’s and boy’s underwear sold in the\nU. S. and of other apparel as well.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nBoth companies came with outstanding CEOs: Steve Mc Kenzie at Albecca and John Holland at\nFruit. John, who had retired from Fruit in 1996, rejoined it three years ago and rescued the company from\nthe disastrous path it had gone down after he’d left. He’s now 70, and I am trying to convince him to make\nhis next retirement coincident with mine (presently scheduled for five years after my death – a date subject,\nhowever, to extension).\nWe initiated and completed two other acquisitions last year that were somewhat below our normal\nsize threshold. In aggregate, however, these businesses earn more than $60 million pre-tax annually. Both\noperate in industries characterized by tough economics, but both also have important competitive strengths\nthat enable them to earn decent returns on capital.\nThe newcomers are:\n(a) CTB, a worldwide leader in equipment for the poultry, hog, egg production and grain\nindustries; and\n(b) Garan, a manufacturer of children’s apparel, whose largest and best-known line is\nGaranimals®.\nThese two companies came with the managers responsible for their impressive records: Vic\nMancinelli at CTB and Seymour Lichtenstein at Garan.\nThe largest acquisition we initiated in 2002 was The Pampered Chef, a company with a fascinating\nhistory dating back to 1980. Doris Christopher was then a 34-year-old suburban Chicago home economics\nteacher with a husband, two little girls, and absolutely no business background. Wanting, however, to\nsupplement her family’s modest income, she turned to thinking about what she knew best – food\npreparation. Why not, she wondered, make a business out of marketing kitchenware, focusing on the items\nshe herself had found most useful?\nTo get started, Doris borrowed $3,000 against her life insurance policy – all the money ever\ninjected into the company – and went to the Merchandise Mart on a buying expedition. There, she picked\nup a dozen each of this and that, and then went home to set up operations in her basement.\nHer plan was to conduct in-home presentations to small groups of women, gathered at the homes\nof their friends. While driving to her first presentation, though, Doris almost talked herself into returning\nhome, convinced she was doomed to fail.\nBut the women she faced that evening loved her and her products, purchased $175 of goods, and\nTPC was underway. Working with her husband, Jay, Doris did $50,000 of business in the first year.\nToday – only 22 years later – TPC does more than $700 million of business annually, working through\n67,000 kitchen consultants.\nI’ve been to a TPC party, and it’s easy to see why the business is a success. The company’s\nproducts, in large part proprietary, are well-styled and highly useful, and the consultants are knowledgeable\nand enthusiastic. Everyone has a good time. Hurry to pamperedchef. com on the Internet to find where to\nattend a party near you.\nTwo years ago, Doris brought in Sheila O’Connell Cooper, now CEO, to share the management\nload, and in August they met with me in Omaha. It took me about ten seconds to decide that these were\ntwo managers with whom I wished to partner, and we promptly made a deal. Berkshire shareholders\ncouldn’t be luckier than to be associated with Doris and Sheila.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire also made some important acquisitions last year through Mid American Energy Holdings\n(MEHC), a company in which our equity interest is 80.2%. Because the Public Utility Holding Company\nAct (PUHCA) limits us to 9.9% voting control, however, we are unable to fully consolidate MEHC’s\nfinancial statements.\nDespite the voting-control limitation – and the somewhat strange capital structure at MEHC it has\nengendered – the company is a key part of Berkshire. Already it has $18 billion of assets and delivers our\nlargest stream of non-insurance earnings. It could well grow to be huge.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "chunk_text": "Acquisitions\n\n\nLast year MEHC acquired two important gas pipelines. The first, Kern River, extends from\nSouthwest Wyoming to Southern California. This line moves about 900 million cubic feet of gas a day and\nis undergoing a $1.2 billion expansion that will double throughput by this fall. At that point, the line will\ncarry enough gas to generate electricity for ten million homes.\nThe second acquisition, Northern Natural Gas, is a 16,600 mile line extending from the Southwest\nto a wide range of Midwestern locations. This purchase completes a corporate odyssey of particular\ninterest to Omahans.\nFrom its beginnings in the 1930 s, Northern Natural was one of Omaha’s premier businesses, run\nby CEOs who regularly distinguished themselves as community leaders. Then, in July, 1985, the company\n• which in 1980 had been renamed Inter North – merged with Houston Natural Gas, a business less than\nhalf its size. The companies announced that the enlarged operation would be headquartered in Omaha,\nwith Inter North’s CEO continuing in that job.\nWithin a year, those promises were broken. By then, the former CEO of Houston Natural had\ntaken over the top job at Inter North, the company had been renamed, and the headquarters had been moved\nto Houston. These switches were orchestrated by the new CEO – Ken Lay – and the name he chose was\nEnron.\nFast forward 15 years to late 2001. Enron ran into the troubles we’ve heard so much about and\nborrowed money from Dynegy, putting up the Northern Natural pipeline operation as collateral. The two\ncompanies quickly had a falling out, and the pipeline’s ownership moved to Dynegy. That company, in\nturn, soon encountered severe financial problems of its own.\nMEHC received a call on Friday, July 26, from Dynegy, which was looking for a quick and\ncertain cash sale of the pipeline. Dynegy phoned the right party: On July 29, we signed a contract, and\nshortly thereafter Northern Natural returned home.\nWhen 2001 began, Charlie and I had no idea that Berkshire would be moving into the pipeline\nbusiness. But upon completion of the Kern River expansion, MEHC will transport about 8% of all gas\nused in the U. S. We continue to look for large energy-related assets, though in the electric utility field\nPUHCA constrains what we can do.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA few years ago, and somewhat by accident, MEHC found itself in the residential real estate\nbrokerage business. It is no accident, however, that we have dramatically expanded the operation.\nMoreover, we are likely to keep on expanding in the future.\nWe call this business Home Services of America. In the various communities it serves, though, it\noperates under the names of the businesses it has acquired, such as CBS in Omaha, Edina Realty in\nMinneapolis and Iowa Realty in Des Moines. In most metropolitan areas in which we operate, we are the\nclear market leader.\nHome Services is now the second largest residential brokerage business in the country. On one\nside or the other (or both), we participated in $37 billion of transactions last year, up 100% from 2001.\nMost of our growth came from three acquisitions we made during 2002, the largest of which was\nPrudential California Realty. Last year, this company, the leading realtor in a territory consisting of Los\nAngeles, Orange and San Diego Counties, participated in $16 billion of closings.\nIn a very short period, Ron Peltier, the company’s CEO, has increased Home Services’ revenues –\nand profits – dramatically. Though this business will always be cyclical, it’s one we like and in which we\ncontinue to have an appetite for sensible acquisitions.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nDave Sokol, MEHC’s CEO, and Greg Abel, his key associate, are huge assets for Berkshire. They\nare dealmakers, and they are managers. Berkshire stands ready to inject massive amounts of money into\nMEHC – and it will be fun to watch how far Dave and Greg can take the business.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "chunk_text": "The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\n\nThe Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\nOur core business — though we have others of great importance — is insurance. To understand\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company. The key\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all,\nthe long-term outlook for both of these factors.\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises\nbecause premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.\nDuring that time, the insurer invests the money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:\nThe premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.\nThat leaves it running an “underwriting loss,” which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if\nits cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds. But the\nbusiness is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money. Moreover, the downward\ntrend of interest rates in recent years has transformed underwriting losses that formerly were tolerable into\nburdens that move insurance businesses deeply into the lemon category.\nHistorically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost. Indeed, our cost has been less than\nzero in many years; that is, we’ve actually been paid for holding other people’s money. In 2001, however,\nour cost was terrible, coming in at 12.8%, about half of which was attributable to World Trade Center\nlosses. Back in 1983-84, we had years that were even worse. There’s nothing automatic about cheap float.\nThe table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of\nBerkshire’s insurance operations since we entered the business 36 years ago upon acquiring National\nIndemnity Company (whose traditional lines are included in the segment “Other Primary”). For the table\nwe have calculated our float — which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume — by\nadding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned\npremium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid\ntaxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. (Got that?)\nYearend Float (in $ millions)\nOther Other\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\n1967 20 20\n1977 40 131 171\n1987 701 807 1,508\n1997 2,917 4,014 455 7,386\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,754\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,298\n2000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,871\n2001 4,251 19,310 11,262 685 35,508\n2002 4,678 22,207 13,396 943 41,224\nLast year our cost of float was 1%. As I mentioned earlier, you should temper your enthusiasm\nabout this favorable result given that no megacatastrophe occurred in 2002. We’re certain to get one of\nthese disasters periodically, and when we do our float-cost will spike.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nOur 2002 results were hurt by 1) a painful charge at General Re for losses that should have been\nrecorded as costs in earlier years, and 2) a “desirable” charge we incur annually for retroactive insurance (see\nthe next section for more about these items). These costs totaled $1.75 billion, or about 4.6% of float.\nFortunately, our overall underwriting experience on 2002 business was excellent, which allowed us, even\nafter the charges noted, to approach a no-cost result.\nAbsent a megacatastrophe, I expect our cost of float in 2003 to again be very low – perhaps even less\nthan zero. In the rundown of our insurance operations that follows, you will see why I’m optimistic that, over\ntime, our underwriting results will both surpass those achieved by the industry and deliver us investable funds\nat minimal cost.",

All of our major insurance businesses, with\none exception, have regularly met those tests.\nThe exception is General Re, and there was much to do at that company last year to get it up to\nsnuff. I’m delighted to report that under Joe Brandon’s leadership, and with yeoman assistance by Tad\nMontross, enormous progress has been made on each of the fronts described.\nWhen I agreed in 1998 to merge Berkshire with Gen Re, I thought that company stuck to the three\nrules I’ve enumerated. I had studied the operation for decades and had observed underwriting discipline that\nwas consistent and reserving that was conservative. At merger time, I detected no slippage in Gen Re’s\nstandards.\nI was dead wrong. Gen Re’s culture and practices had substantially changed and unbeknownst to\nmanagement – and to me – the company was grossly mispricing its current business. In addition, Gen Re had\naccumulated an aggregation of risks that would have been fatal had, say, terrorists detonated several largescale nuclear bombs in an attack on the U. S. A disaster of that scope was highly improbable, of course, but it\nis up to insurers to limit their risks in a manner that leaves their finances rock-solid if the “impossible”\nhappens. Indeed, had Gen Re remained independent, the World Trade Center attack alone would have\nthreatened the company’s existence.\nWhen the WTC disaster occurred, it exposed weaknesses in Gen Re’s operations that I should have\ndetected earlier. But I was lucky: Joe and Tad were on hand, freshly endowed with increased authority and\neager to rapidly correct the errors of the past. They knew what to do – and they did it.\nIt takes time for insurance policies to run off, however, and 2002 was well along before we managed\nto reduce our aggregation of nuclear, chemical and biological risk (NCB) to a tolerable level. That problem is\nnow behind us.\nOn another front, Gen Re’s underwriting attitude has been dramatically altered: The entire\norganization now understands that we wish to write only properly-priced business, whatever the effect on\nvolume. Joe and Tad judge themselves only by Gen Re’s underwriting profitability. Size simply doesn’t\ncount.\nFinally, we are making every effort to get our reserving right. If we fail at that, we can’t know our\ntrue costs. And any insurer that has no idea what its costs are is heading for big trouble.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "chunk_text": "Insurance Operations\n\n\nAt yearend 2001, General Re attempted to reserve adequately for all losses that had occurred prior to\nthat date and were not yet paid – but we failed badly. Therefore the company’s 2002 underwriting results\nwere penalized by an additional $1.31 billion that we recorded to correct the estimation mistakes of earlier\nyears. When I review the reserving errors that have been uncovered at General Re, a line from a country song\nseems apt: “I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then.”\nI can promise you that our top priority going forward is to avoid inadequate reserving. But I can’t\nguarantee success. The natural tendency of most casualty-insurance managers is to underreserve, and they\nmust have a particular mindset – which, it may surprise you, has nothing to do with actuarial expertise – if\nthey are to overcome this devastating bias. Additionally, a reinsurer faces far more difficulties in reserving\nproperly than does a primary insurer. Nevertheless, at Berkshire, we have generally been successful in our\nreserving, and we are determined to be at General Re as well.\nIn summary, I believe General Re is now well positioned to deliver huge amounts of no-cost float to\nBerkshire and that its sink-the-ship catastrophe risk has been eliminated. The company still possesses the\nimportant competitive strengths that I’ve outlined in the past. And it gained another highly significant\nadvantage last year when each of its three largest worldwide competitors, previously rated AAA, was\ndemoted by at least one rating agency. Among the giants, General Re, rated AAA across-the-board, is now in\na class by itself in respect to financial strength.\nNo attribute is more important. Recently, in contrast, one of the world’s largest reinsurers – a\ncompany regularly recommended to primary insurers by leading brokers – has all but ceased paying claims,\nincluding those both valid and due. This company owes many billions of dollars to hundreds of primary\ninsurers who now face massive write-offs. “Cheap” reinsurance is a fool’s bargain: When an insurer lays out\nmoney today in exchange for a reinsurer’s promise to pay a decade or two later, it’s dangerous – and possibly\nlife-threatening – for the insurer to deal with any but the strongest reinsurer around.\nBerkshire shareholders owe Joe and Tad a huge thank you for their accomplishments in 2002. They\nworked harder during the year than I would wish for anyone – and it is paying off.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt GEICO, everything went so well in 2002 that we should pinch ourselves. Growth was\nsubstantial, profits were outstanding, policyholder retention was up and sales productivity jumped\nsignificantly. These trends continue in early 2003.\nThank Tony Nicely for all of this. As anyone who knows him will attest, Tony has been in love with\nGEICO for 41 years – ever since he went to work for the company at 18 – and his results reflect this passion.\nHe is proud of the money we save policyholders – about $1 billion annually versus what other insurers, on\naverage, would have charged them. He is proud of the service we provide these policyholders: In a key\nindustry survey, GEICO was recently ranked above all major competitors. He is proud of his 19,162\nassociates, who last year were awarded profit-sharing payments equal to 19% of their base salary because of\nthe splendid results they achieved. And he is proud of the growing profits he delivers to Berkshire\nshareholders.\nGEICO took in $2.9 billion in premiums when Berkshire acquired full ownership in 1996. Last\nyear, its volume was $6.9 billion, with plenty of growth to come. Particularly promising is the company’s\nInternet operation, whose new business grew by 75% last year. Check us out at GEICO. com (or call 800847-7536). In most states, shareholders get a special 8% discount.\nHere’s one footnote to GEICO’s 2002 earnings that underscores the need for insurers to do business\nwith only the strongest of reinsurers. In 1981-1983, the managers then running GEICO decided to try their\nhand at writing commercial umbrella and product liability insurance. The risks seemed modest: the company\ntook in only $3,051,000 from this line and used almost all of it – $2,979,000 – to buy reinsurance in order to\nlimit its losses. GEICO was left with a paltry $72,000 as compensation for the minor portion of the risk that\nit retained. But this small bite of the apple was more than enough to make the experience memorable.\nGEICO’s losses from this venture now total a breathtaking $94.1 million or about 130,000% of the net\npremium it received. Of the total loss, uncollectable receivables from deadbeat reinsurers account for no less\nthan $90.3 million (including $19 million charged in 2002). So much for “cheap” reinsurance.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

If we ever\nput a photo in a Berkshire annual report, it will be of Ajit. In color!\nAjit’s operation has amassed $13.4 billion of float, more than all but a handful of insurers have ever\nbuilt up. He accomplished this from a standing start in 1986, and even now has a workforce numbering only\n20. And, most important, he has produced underwriting profits.\nHis profits are particularly remarkable if you factor in some accounting arcana that I am about to lay\non you. So prepare to eat your spinach (or, alternatively, if debits and credits aren’t your thing, skip the next\ntwo paragraphs).\nAjit’s 2002 underwriting profit of $534 million came after his operation recognized a charge of $428\nmillion attributable to “retroactive” insurance he has written over the years. In this line of business, we\nassume from another insurer the obligation to pay up to a specified amount for losses they have already\nincurred – often for events that took place decades earlier – but that are yet to be paid (for example, because a\nworker hurt in 1980 will receive monthly payments for life). In these arrangements, an insurer pays us a large\nupfront premium, but one that is less than the losses we expect to pay. We willingly accept this differential\nbecause a) our payments are capped, and b) we get to use the money until loss payments are actually made,\nwith these often stretching out over a decade or more. About 80% of the $6.6 billion in asbestos and\nenvironmental loss reserves that we carry arises from capped contracts, whose costs consequently can’t\nskyrocket.\nWhen we write a retroactive policy, we immediately record both the premium and a reserve for the\nexpected losses. The difference between the two is entered as an asset entitled “deferred charges –\nreinsurance assumed.” This is no small item: at yearend, for all retroactive policies, it was $3.4 billion. We\nthen amortize this asset downward by charges to income over the expected life of each policy. These charges\n• $440 million in 2002, including charges at Gen Re – create an underwriting loss, but one that is intentional\nand desirable. And even after this drag on reported results, Ajit achieved a large underwriting gain last year.\nWe want to emphasize, however, that we assume risks in Ajit’s operation that are huge – far larger\nthan those retained by any other insurer in the world. Therefore, a single event could cause a major swing in\nAjit’s results in any given quarter or year. That bothers us not at all: As long as we are paid appropriately, we\nlove taking on short-term volatility that others wish to shed. At Berkshire, we would rather earn a lumpy\n15% over time than a smooth 12%.\nIf you see Ajit at our annual meeting, bow deeply.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire’s smaller insurers had an outstanding year. Their aggregate float grew by 38%, and they\nrealized an underwriting profit of $32 million, or 4.5% of premiums. Collectively, these operations would\nmake one of the finest insurance companies in the country.\nIncluded in these figures, however, were terrible results in our California workers’ compensation\noperation. There, we have work to do. There, too, our reserving severely missed the mark. Until we figure\nout how to get this business right, we will keep it small.\nFor the fabulous year they had in 2002, we thank Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Tom Nerney, Don Towle\nand Don Wurster. They added a lot of value to your Berkshire investment.",

    "chunk_text": "Sources of Reported Earnings\n\n• In a so-so year for home-furnishing and jewelry retailers, our operations did well. Among our eight\nretailing operations, the best performer was Homemaker’s in Des Moines. There, the talented\nMerschman family achieved outstanding gains in both sales and profits.\nNebraska Furniture Mart will open a new blockbuster store in metropolitan Kansas City in August.\nWith 450,000 square feet of retail space, it could well produce the second largest volume of any\nfurniture store in the country – the Omaha operation being the national champion. I hope Berkshire\nshareholders in the Kansas City area will come out for the opening (and keep coming).\n• Our home and construction-related businesses – Acme Brick, Benjamin Moore Paint, Johns Manville, Mi Tek and Shaw – delivered $941 million of pre-tax earnings last year. Of particular\nsignificance was Shaw’s gain from $292 million in 2001 to $424 million. Bob Shaw and Julian Saul\nare terrific operators. Carpet prices increased only 1% last year, but Shaw’s productivity gains and\nexcellent expense control delivered significantly improved margins.\nWe cherish cost-consciousness at Berkshire. Our model is the widow who went to the local\nnewspaper to place an obituary notice. Told there was a 25-cents-a-word charge, she requested\n“Fred Brown died.” She was then informed there was a seven-word minimum. “Okay” the\nbereaved woman replied, “make it ‘Fred Brown died, golf clubs for sale’.”\n• Earnings from flight services increased last year – but only because we realized a special pre-tax\ngain of $60 million from the sale of our 50% interest in Flight Safety Boeing. Without this gain,\nearnings from our training business would have fallen slightly in concert with the slowdown in\nbusiness-aviation activity. Flight Safety training continues to be the gold standard for the industry,\nand we expect growth in the years to come.\nAt Net Jets, our fractional-ownership operation, we are the runaway leader of the four-company field.\nFAA records indicate that our industry share in 2002 was 75%, meaning that clients purchased or\nleased planes from us that were valued at triple those recorded by our three competitors combined.\nLast year, our fleet flew 132.7 million nautical miles, taking clients to 130 countries.\nOur preeminence is directly attributable to Rich Santulli, Net Jets’ CEO. He invented the business in\n1986 and ever since has exhibited an unbending devotion to the highest levels of service, safety and\nsecurity. Rich, Charlie and I insist on planes (and personnel) worthy of carrying our own families –\nbecause they regularly do.\nThough Net Jets revenues set a record in 2002, the company again lost money. A small profit in the\nU. S. was more than offset by losses in Europe. Overall, the fractional-ownership industry lost\nsignificant sums last year, and that is almost certain to be the outcome in 2003 as well. The bald fact\nis that airplanes are costly to operate.\nOver time, this economic reality should work to our advantage, given that for a great many\ncompanies, private aircraft are an essential business tool. And for most of these companies, Net Jets\nmakes compelling sense as either a primary or supplementary supplier of the aircraft they need.\nMany businesses could save millions of dollars annually by flying with us. Indeed, the yearly\nsavings at some large companies could exceed $10 million. Equally important, these companies\nwould actually increase their operational capabilities by using us. A fractional ownership of a single\nNet Jets plane allows a client to have several planes in the air simultaneously. Additionally, through\nthe interchange arrangement we make available, an owner of an interest in one plane can fly any of\n12 other models, using whatever plane makes most sense for a mission. (One of my sisters owns a\nfraction of a Falcon 2000, which she uses for trips to Hawaii, but – exhibiting the Buffett gene – she\ninterchanges to a more economical Citation Excel for short trips in the U. S.)\nThe roster of Net Jets users confirms the advantages we offer major businesses. Take General\nElectric, for example. It has a large fleet of its own but also has an unsurpassed knowledge of how\nto utilize aircraft effectively and economically. And it is our largest customer.\n• Our finance and financial products line covers a variety of operations, among them certain activities\nin high-grade fixed-income securities that proved highly profitable in 2002. Earnings in this arena\nwill probably continue for a while, but are certain to decrease – and perhaps disappear – in time.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nThis category also includes a highly satisfactory – but rapidly diminishing – income stream from our\nBerkadia investment in Finova (described in last year’s report). Our partner, Leucadia National\nCorp., has managed this operation with great skill, willingly doing far more than its share of the\nheavy lifting. I like this division of labor and hope to join with Leucadia in future transactions.\nOn the minus side, the Finance line also includes the operations of General Re Securities, a\nderivatives and trading business. This entity lost $173 million pre-tax last year, a result that, in part,\nis a belated acknowledgment of faulty, albeit standard, accounting it used in earlier periods.\nDerivatives, in fact, deserve an extensive look, both in respect to the accounting their users employ\nand to the problems they may pose for both individual companies and our economy.",

    "chunk_text": "Derivatives\n\nDerivatives\nCharlie and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with\nthem: We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.\nHaving delivered that thought, which I’ll get back to, let me retreat to explaining derivatives, though\nthe explanation must be general because the word covers an extraordinarily wide range of financial contracts.\nEssentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be\ndetermined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values. If, for\nexample, you are either long or short an S&P 500 futures contract, you are a party to a very simple derivatives\ntransaction – with your gain or loss derived from movements in the index. Derivatives contracts are of\nvarying duration (running sometimes to 20 or more years) and their value is often tied to several variables.\nUnless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the\ncreditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the\ncounterparties record profits and losses – often huge in amount – in their current earnings statements without\nso much as a penny changing hands.\nThe range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it\nseems, madmen). At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years\nin the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins\nto be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem – at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.\nWhen we purchased Gen Re, it came with General Re Securities, a derivatives dealer that Charlie\nand I didn’t want, judging it to be dangerous. We failed in our attempts to sell the operation, however, and\nare now terminating it.\nBut closing down a derivatives business is easier said than done. It will be a great many years before\nwe are totally out of this operation (though we reduce our exposure daily). In fact, the reinsurance and\nderivatives businesses are similar: Like Hell, both are easy to enter and almost impossible to exit. In either\nindustry, once you write a contract – which may require a large payment decades later – you are usually stuck\nwith it. True, there are methods by which the risk can be laid off with others. But most strategies of that kind\nleave you with residual liability.\nAnother commonality of reinsurance and derivatives is that both generate reported earnings that are\noften wildly overstated. That’s true because today’s earnings are in a significant way based on estimates\nwhose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years.\nErrors will usually be honest, reflecting only the human tendency to take an optimistic view of one’s\ncommitments. But the parties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them.\nThose who trade derivatives are usually paid (in whole or part) on “earnings” calculated by mark-to-market\naccounting. But often there is no real market (think about our contract involving twins) and “mark-to-model”\nis utilized. This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief. As a general rule, contracts involving\nmultiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counterparties to use\nfanciful assumptions. In the twins scenario, for example, the two parties to the contract might well use\ndiffering models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years. In extreme cases, mark-to-model\ndegenerates into what I would call mark-to-myth.\nOf course, both internal and outside auditors review the numbers, but that’s no easy job. For\nexample, General Re Securities at yearend (after ten months of winding down its operation) had 14,384\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\ncontracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world. Each contract had a plus or minus\nvalue derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity. Valuing a\nportfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.\nThe valuation problem is far from academic: In recent years, some huge-scale frauds and near-frauds\nhave been facilitated by derivatives trades. In the energy and electric utility sectors, for example, companies\nused derivatives and trading activities to report great “earnings” – until the roof fell in when they actually\ntried to convert the derivatives-related receivables on their balance sheets into cash. “Mark-to-market” then\nturned out to be truly “mark-to-myth.”\nI can assure you that the marking errors in the derivatives business have not been symmetrical.\nAlmost invariably, they have favored either the trader who was eyeing a multi-million dollar bonus or the\nCEO who wanted to report impressive “earnings” (or both). The bonuses were paid, and the CEO profited\nfrom his options. Only much later did shareholders learn that the reported earnings were a sham.\nAnother problem about derivatives is that they can exacerbate trouble that a corporation has run into\nfor completely unrelated reasons. This pile-on effect occurs because many derivatives contracts require that a\ncompany suffering a credit downgrade immediately supply collateral to counterparties. Imagine, then, that a\ncompany is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their\nrequirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company. The need to\nmeet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more\ndowngrades. It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown.\nDerivatives also create a daisy-chain risk that is akin to the risk run by insurers or reinsurers that lay\noff much of their business with others. In both cases, huge receivables from many counterparties tend to\nbuild up over time. (At Gen Re Securities, we still have $6.5 billion of receivables, though we’ve been in a\nliquidation mode for nearly a year.) A participant may see himself as prudent, believing his large credit\nexposures to be diversified and therefore not dangerous. Under certain circumstances, though, an exogenous\nevent that causes the receivable from Company A to go bad will also affect those from Companies B through\nZ. History teaches us that a crisis often causes problems to correlate in a manner undreamed of in more\ntranquil times.\nIn banking, the recognition of a “linkage” problem was one of the reasons for the formation of the\nFederal Reserve System. Before the Fed was established, the failure of weak banks would sometimes put\nsudden and unanticipated liquidity demands on previously-strong banks, causing them to fail in turn. The\nFed now insulates the strong from the troubles of the weak. But there is no central bank assigned to the job of\npreventing the dominoes toppling in insurance or derivatives. In these industries, firms that are\nfundamentally solid can become troubled simply because of the travails of other firms further down the chain.\nWhen a “chain reaction” threat exists within an industry, it pays to minimize links of any kind. That’s how\nwe conduct our reinsurance business, and it’s one reason we are exiting derivatives.\nMany people argue that derivatives reduce systemic problems, in that participants who can’t bear\ncertain risks are able to transfer them to stronger hands. These people believe that derivatives act to stabilize\nthe economy, facilitate trade, and eliminate bumps for individual participants. And, on a micro level, what\nthey say is often true. Indeed, at Berkshire, I sometimes engage in large-scale derivatives transactions in\norder to facilitate certain investment strategies.\nCharlie and I believe, however, that the macro picture is dangerous and getting more so. Large\namounts of risk, particularly credit risk, have become concentrated in the hands of relatively few derivatives\ndealers, who in addition trade extensively with one other. The troubles of one could quickly infect the others.\nOn top of that, these dealers are owed huge amounts by non-dealer counterparties. Some of these\ncounterparties, as I’ve mentioned, are linked in ways that could cause them to contemporaneously run into a\nproblem because of a single event (such as the implosion of the telecom industry or the precipitous decline in\nthe value of merchant power projects). Linkage, when it suddenly surfaces, can trigger serious systemic\nproblems.\nIndeed, in 1998, the leveraged and derivatives-heavy activities of a single hedge fund, Long-Term\nCapital Management, caused the Federal Reserve anxieties so severe that it hastily orchestrated a rescue\neffort. In later Congressional testimony, Fed officials acknowledged that, had they not intervened, the\noutstanding trades of LTCM – a firm unknown to the general public and employing only a few hundred\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\npeople – could well have posed a serious threat to the stability of American markets. In other words, the Fed\nacted because its leaders were fearful of what might have happened to other financial institutions had the\nLTCM domino toppled. And this affair, though it paralyzed many parts of the fixed-income market for\nweeks, was far from a worst-case scenario.\nOne of the derivatives instruments that LTCM used was total-return swaps, contracts that facilitate\n100% leverage in various markets, including stocks. For example, Party A to a contract, usually a bank, puts\nup all of the money for the purchase of a stock while Party B, without putting up any capital, agrees that at a\nfuture date it will receive any gain or pay any loss that the bank realizes.\nTotal-return swaps of this type make a joke of margin requirements. Beyond that, other types of\nderivatives severely curtail the ability of regulators to curb leverage and generally get their arms around the\nrisk profiles of banks, insurers and other financial institutions. Similarly, even experienced investors and\nanalysts encounter major problems in analyzing the financial condition of firms that are heavily involved with\nderivatives contracts. When Charlie and I finish reading the long footnotes detailing the derivatives activities\nof major banks, the only thing we understand is that we don’t understand how much risk the institution is\nrunning.\nThe derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly\nmultiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear. Knowledge of how dangerous\nthey are has already permeated the electricity and gas businesses, in which the eruption of major troubles\ncaused the use of derivatives to diminish dramatically. Elsewhere, however, the derivatives business\ncontinues to expand unchecked. Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to\ncontrol, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts.\nCharlie and I believe Berkshire should be a fortress of financial strength – for the sake of our\nowners, creditors, policyholders and employees. We try to be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and\nthat posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives\ncontracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside. In our view,\nhowever, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are\npotentially lethal.",

Charlie and I are increasingly comfortable with our holdings in\nBerkshire’s major investees because most of them have increased their earnings while their valuations have\ndecreased. But we are not inclined to add to them. Though these enterprises have good prospects, we don’t\nyet believe their shares are undervalued.\nIn our view, the same conclusion fits stocks generally. Despite three years of falling prices, which\nhave significantly improved the attractiveness of common stocks, we still find very few that even mildly\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\ninterest us. That dismal fact is testimony to the insanity of valuations reached during The Great Bubble.\nUnfortunately, the hangover may prove to be proportional to the binge.\nThe aversion to equities that Charlie and I exhibit today is far from congenital. We love owning\ncommon stocks – if they can be purchased at attractive prices. In my 61 years of investing, 50 or so years\nhave offered that kind of opportunity. There will be years like that again. Unless, however, we see a very\nhigh probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns (which translate to 6½-7% after corporate tax), we will sit on\nthe sidelines. With short-term money returning less than 1% after-tax, sitting it out is no fun. But\noccasionally successful investing requires inactivity.\nLast year we were, however, able to make sensible investments in a few “junk” bonds and loans.\nOverall, our commitments in this sector sextupled, reaching $8.3 billion by yearend.\nInvesting in junk bonds and investing in stocks are alike in certain ways: Both activities require us to\nmake a price-value calculation and also to scan hundreds of securities to find the very few that have attractive\nreward/risk ratios. But there are important differences between the two disciplines as well. In stocks, we\nexpect every commitment to work out well because we concentrate on conservatively financed businesses\nwith strong competitive strengths, run by able and honest people. If we buy into these companies at sensible\nprices, losses should be rare. Indeed, during the 38 years we have run the company’s affairs, gains from the\nequities we manage at Berkshire (that is, excluding those managed at General Re and GEICO) have exceeded\nlosses by a ratio of about 100 to one.\nPurchasing junk bonds, we are dealing with enterprises that are far more marginal. These businesses\nare usually overloaded with debt and often operate in industries characterized by low returns on capital.\nAdditionally, the quality of management is sometimes questionable. Management may even have interests\nthat are directly counter to those of debtholders. Therefore, we expect that we will have occasional large\nlosses in junk issues. So far, however, we have done reasonably well in this field.",

Indeed, nearly 2,000 years\nago, Jesus Christ addressed this subject, speaking (Luke 16: 2) approvingly of “a certain rich man” who told\nhis manager, “Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest no longer be steward.”\nAccountability and stewardship withered in the last decade, becoming qualities deemed of little\nimportance by those caught up in the Great Bubble. As stock prices went up, the behavioral norms of\nmanagers went down. By the late ’90 s, as a result, CEOs who traveled the high road did not encounter heavy\ntraffic.\nMost CEOs, it should be noted, are men and women you would be happy to have as trustees for your\nchildren’s assets or as next-door neighbors. Too many of these people, however, have in recent years\nbehaved badly at the office, fudging numbers and drawing obscene pay for mediocre business achievements.\nThese otherwise decent people simply followed the career path of Mae West: “I was Snow White but I\ndrifted.”\nIn theory, corporate boards should have prevented this deterioration of conduct. I last wrote about\nthe responsibilities of directors in the 1993 annual report. (We will send you a copy of this discussion on\nrequest, or you may read it on the Internet in the Corporate Governance section of the 1993 letter.) There, I\nsaid that directors “should behave as if there was a single absentee owner, whose long-term interest they\nshould try to further in all proper ways.” This means that directors must get rid of a manager who is mediocre\nor worse, no matter how likable he may be. Directors must react as did the chorus-girl bride of an 85-yearold multimillionaire when he asked whether she would love him if he lost his money. “Of course,” the young\nbeauty replied, “I would miss you, but I would still love you.”\nIn the 1993 annual report, I also said directors had another job: “If able but greedy managers overreach and try to dip too deeply into the shareholders’ pockets, directors must slap their hands.” Since I wrote\nthat, over-reaching has become common but few hands have been slapped.\nWhy have intelligent and decent directors failed so miserably? The answer lies not in inadequate\nlaws – it’s always been clear that directors are obligated to represent the interests of shareholders – but rather\nin what I’d call “boardroom atmosphere.”\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "chunk_text": "Corporate Governance\n\n\nIt’s almost impossible, for example, in a boardroom populated by well-mannered people, to raise the\nquestion of whether the CEO should be replaced. It’s equally awkward to question a proposed acquisition\nthat has been endorsed by the CEO, particularly when his inside staff and outside advisors are present and\nunanimously support his decision. (They wouldn’t be in the room if they didn’t.) Finally, when the\ncompensation committee – armed, as always, with support from a high-paid consultant – reports on a\nmegagrant of options to the CEO, it would be like belching at the dinner table for a director to suggest that the\ncommittee reconsider.\nThese “social” difficulties argue for outside directors regularly meeting without the CEO – a reform\nthat is being instituted and that I enthusiastically endorse. I doubt, however, that most of the other new\ngovernance rules and recommendations will provide benefits commensurate with the monetary and other\ncosts they impose.\nThe current cry is for “independent” directors. It is certainly true that it is desirable to have directors\nwho think and speak independently – but they must also be business-savvy, interested and shareholderoriented. In my 1993 commentary, those are the three qualities I described as essential.\nOver a span of 40 years, I have been on 19 public-company boards (excluding Berkshire’s) and have\ninteracted with perhaps 250 directors. Most of them were “independent” as defined by today’s rules. But the\ngreat majority of these directors lacked at least one of the three qualities I value. As a result, their\ncontribution to shareholder well-being was minimal at best and, too often, negative. These people, decent and\nintelligent though they were, simply did not know enough about business and/or care enough about\nshareholders to question foolish acquisitions or egregious compensation. My own behavior, I must ruefully\nadd, frequently fell short as well: Too often I was silent when management made proposals that I judged to be\ncounter to the interests of shareholders. In those cases, collegiality trumped independence.\nSo that we may further see the failings of “independence,” let’s look at a 62-year case study covering\nthousands of companies. Since 1940, federal law has mandated that a large proportion of the directors of\ninvestment companies (most of these mutual funds) be independent. The requirement was originally 40% and\nnow it is 50%. In any case, the typical fund has long operated with a majority of directors who qualify as\nindependent.\nThese directors and the entire board have many perfunctory duties, but in actuality have only two\nimportant responsibilities: obtaining the best possible investment manager and negotiating with that manager\nfor the lowest possible fee. When you are seeking investment help yourself, those two goals are the only ones\nthat count, and directors acting for other investors should have exactly the same priorities. Yet when it comes\nto independent directors pursuing either goal, their record has been absolutely pathetic.\nMany thousands of investment-company boards meet annually to carry out the vital job of selecting\nwho will manage the savings of the millions of owners they represent. Year after year the directors of Fund\nA select manager A, Fund B directors select manager B, etc. … in a zombie-like process that makes a\nmockery of stewardship. Very occasionally, a board will revolt. But for the most part, a monkey will type\nout a Shakespeare play before an “independent” mutual-fund director will suggest that his fund look at other\nmanagers, even if the incumbent manager has persistently delivered substandard performance. When they are\nhandling their own money, of course, directors will look to alternative advisors – but it never enters their\nminds to do so when they are acting as fiduciaries for others.\nThe hypocrisy permeating the system is vividly exposed when a fund management company – call it\n“A” – is sold for a huge sum to Manager “B”. Now the “independent” directors experience a “counterrevelation” and decide that Manager B is the best that can be found – even though B was available (and\nignored) in previous years. Not so incidentally, B also could formerly have been hired at a far lower rate than\nis possible now that it has bought Manager A. That’s because B has laid out a fortune to acquire A, and B\nmust now recoup that cost through fees paid by the A shareholders who were “delivered” as part of the deal.\n(For a terrific discussion of the mutual fund business, read John Bogle’s Common Sense on Mutual Funds.)\nA few years ago, my daughter was asked to become a director of a family of funds managed by a\nmajor institution. The fees she would have received as a director were very substantial, enough to have\nincreased her annual income by about 50% (a boost, she will tell you, she could use!). Legally, she would\nhave been an independent director. But did the fund manager who approached her think there was any\nchance that she would think independently as to what advisor the fund should employ? Of course not. I am\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nproud to say that she showed real independence by turning down the offer. The fund, however, had no\ntrouble filling the slot (and – surprise – the fund has not changed managers).\nInvestment company directors have failed as well in negotiating management fees (just as\ncompensation committees of many American companies have failed to hold the compensation of their CEOs\nto sensible levels). If you or I were empowered, I can assure you that we could easily negotiate materially\nlower management fees with the incumbent managers of most mutual funds. And, believe me, if directors\nwere promised a portion of any fee savings they realized, the skies would be filled with falling fees. Under\nthe current system, though, reductions mean nothing to “independent” directors while meaning everything to\nmanagers. So guess who wins?\nHaving the right money manager, of course, is far more important to a fund than reducing the\nmanager’s fee. Both tasks are nonetheless the job of directors. And in stepping up to these all-important\nresponsibilities, tens of thousands of “independent” directors, over more than six decades, have failed\nmiserably. (They’ve succeeded, however, in taking care of themselves; their fees from serving on multiple\nboards of a single “family” of funds often run well into six figures.)\nWhen the manager cares deeply and the directors don’t, what’s needed is a powerful countervailing\nforce – and that’s the missing element in today’s corporate governance. Getting rid of mediocre CEOs and\neliminating overreaching by the able ones requires action by owners – big owners. The logistics aren’t that\ntough: The ownership of stock has grown increasingly concentrated in recent decades, and today it would be\neasy for institutional managers to exert their will on problem situations. Twenty, or even fewer, of the largest\ninstitutions, acting together, could effectively reform corporate governance at a given company, simply by\nwithholding their votes for directors who were tolerating odious behavior. In my view, this kind of concerted\naction is the only way that corporate stewardship can be meaningfully improved.\nUnfortunately, certain major investing institutions have “glass house” problems in arguing for better\ngovernance elsewhere; they would shudder, for example, at the thought of their own performance and fees\nbeing closely inspected by their own boards. But Jack Bogle of Vanguard fame, Chris Davis of Davis\nAdvisors, and Bill Miller of Legg Mason are now offering leadership in getting CEOs to treat their owners\nproperly. Pension funds, as well as other fiduciaries, will reap better investment returns in the future if they\nsupport these men.\nThe acid test for reform will be CEO compensation. Managers will cheerfully agree to board\n“diversity,” attest to SEC filings and adopt meaningless proposals relating to process. What many will fight,\nhowever, is a hard look at their own pay and perks.\nIn recent years compensation committees too often have been tail-wagging puppy dogs meekly\nfollowing recommendations by consultants, a breed not known for allegiance to the faceless shareholders who\npay their fees. (If you can’t tell whose side someone is on, they are not on yours.) True, each committee is\nrequired by the SEC to state its reasoning about pay in the proxy. But the words are usually boilerplate\nwritten by the company’s lawyers or its human-relations department.\nThis costly charade should cease. Directors should not serve on compensation committees unless\nthey are themselves capable of negotiating on behalf of owners. They should explain both how they think\nabout pay and how they measure performance. Dealing with shareholders’ money, moreover, they should\nbehave as they would were it their own.\nIn the 1890 s, Samuel Gompers described the goal of organized labor as “More!” In the 1990 s,\nAmerica’s CEOs adopted his battle cry. The upshot is that CEOs have often amassed riches while their\nshareholders have experienced financial disasters.\nDirectors should stop such piracy. There’s nothing wrong with paying well for truly exceptional\nbusiness performance. But, for anything short of that, it’s time for directors to shout “Less!” It would be a\ntravesty if the bloated pay of recent years became a baseline for future compensation. Compensation\ncommittees should go back to the drawing boards.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nRules that have been proposed and that are almost certain to go into effect will require changes in\nBerkshire’s board, obliging us to add directors who meet the codified requirements for “independence.”\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

It baffles me how the many directors who look to these dollars for\nperhaps 20% or more of their annual income can be considered independent when Ron Olson, for example,\nwho is on our board, may be deemed not independent because he receives a tiny percentage of his very large\nincome from Berkshire legal fees. As the investment company saga suggests, a director whose moderate\nincome is heavily dependent on directors’ fees – and who hopes mightily to be invited to join other boards in\norder to earn more fees – is highly unlikely to offend a CEO or fellow directors, who in a major way will\ndetermine his reputation in corporate circles. If regulators believe that “significant” money taints\nindependence (and it certainly can), they have overlooked a massive class of possible offenders.\nAt Berkshire, wanting our fees to be meaningless to our directors, we pay them only a pittance.\nAdditionally, not wanting to insulate our directors from any corporate disaster we might have, we don’t\nprovide them with officers’ and directors’ liability insurance (an unorthodoxy that, not so incidentally, has\nsaved our shareholders many millions of dollars over the years). Basically, we want the behavior of our\ndirectors to be driven by the effect their decisions will have on their family’s net worth, not by their\ncompensation. That’s the equation for Charlie and me as managers, and we think it’s the right one for\nBerkshire directors as well.\nTo find new directors, we will look through our shareholders list for people who directly, or in their\nfamily, have had large Berkshire holdings – in the millions of dollars – for a long time. Individuals making\nthat cut should automatically meet two of our tests, namely that they be interested in Berkshire and\nshareholder-oriented. In our third test, we will look for business savvy, a competence that is far from\ncommonplace.\nFinally, we will continue to have members of the Buffett family on the board. They are not there to\nrun the business after I die, nor will they then receive compensation of any kind. Their purpose is to ensure,\nfor both our shareholders and managers, that Berkshire’s special culture will be nurtured when I’m succeeded\nby other CEOs.\nAny change we make in the composition of our board will not alter the way Charlie and I run\nBerkshire. We will continue to emphasize substance over form in our work and waste as little time as\npossible during board meetings in show-and-tell and perfunctory activities. The most important job of our\nboard is likely to be the selection of successors to Charlie and me, and that is a matter upon which it will\nfocus.\nThe board we have had up to now has overseen a shareholder-oriented business, consistently run in\naccord with the economic principles set forth on pages 68-74 (which I urge all new shareholders to read).\nOur goal is to obtain new directors who are equally devoted to those principles.",

    "chunk_text": "The Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee\nAudit committees can’t audit. Only a company’s outside auditor can determine whether the earnings\nthat a management purports to have made are suspect. Reforms that ignore this reality and that instead focus\non the structure and charter of the audit committee will accomplish little.\nAs we’ve discussed, far too many managers have fudged their company’s numbers in recent years,\nusing both accounting and operational techniques that are typically legal but that nevertheless materially\nmislead investors. Frequently, auditors knew about these deceptions. Too often, however, they remained\nsilent. The key job of the audit committee is simply to get the auditors to divulge what they know.\nTo do this job, the committee must make sure that the auditors worry more about misleading its\nmembers than about offending management. In recent years auditors have not felt that way. They have\ninstead generally viewed the CEO, rather than the shareholders or directors, as their client. That has been a\nnatural result of day-to-day working relationships and also of the auditors’ understanding that, no matter what\nthe book says, the CEO and CFO pay their fees and determine whether they are retained for both auditing and\nother work. The rules that have been recently instituted won’t materially change this reality. What will break\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nthis cozy relationship is audit committees unequivocally putting auditors on the spot, making them understand\nthey will become liable for major monetary penalties if they don’t come forth with what they know or\nsuspect.\nIn my opinion, audit committees can accomplish this goal by asking four questions of auditors, the\nanswers to which should be recorded and reported to shareholders. These questions are:\n1. If the auditor were solely responsible for preparation of the company’s financial statements,\nwould they have in any way been prepared differently from the manner selected by\nmanagement? This question should cover both material and nonmaterial differences. If the\nauditor would have done something differently, both management’s argument and the\nauditor’s response should be disclosed. The audit committee should then evaluate the facts.\n2. If the auditor were an investor, would he have received – in plain English – the information\nessential to his understanding the company’s financial performance during the reporting\nperiod?\n3. Is the company following the same internal audit procedure that would be followed if the\nauditor himself were CEO? If not, what are the differences and why?\n4. Is the auditor aware of any actions – either accounting or operational – that have had the\npurpose and effect of moving revenues or expenses from one reporting period to another?\nIf the audit committee asks these questions, its composition – the focus of most reforms – is of minor\nimportance. In addition, the procedure will save time and expense. When auditors are put on the spot, they\nwill do their duty. If they are not put on the spot . . . well, we have seen the results of that.\nThe questions we have enumerated should be asked at least a week before an earnings report is\nreleased to the public. That timing will allow differences between the auditors and management to be aired\nwith the committee and resolved. If the timing is tighter – if an earnings release is imminent when the\nauditors and committee interact – the committee will feel pressure to rubberstamp the prepared figures. Haste\nis the enemy of accuracy. My thinking, in fact, is that the SEC’s recent shortening of reporting deadlines will\nhurt the quality of information that shareholders receive. Charlie and I believe that rule is a mistake and\nshould be rescinded.\nThe primary advantage of our four questions is that they will act as a prophylactic. Once the\nauditors know that the audit committee will require them to affirmatively endorse, rather than merely\nacquiesce to, management’s actions, they will resist misdoings early in the process, well before specious\nfigures become embedded in the company’s books. Fear of the plaintiff’s bar will see to that.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe Chicago Tribune ran a four-part series on Arthur Andersen last September that did a great job of\nilluminating how accounting standards and audit quality have eroded in recent years. A few decades ago, an\nArthur Andersen audit opinion was the gold standard of the profession. Within the firm, an elite Professional\nStandards Group (PSG) insisted on honest reporting, no matter what pressures were applied by the client.\nSticking to these principles, the PSG took a stand in 1992 that the cost of stock options should be recorded as\nthe expense it clearly was. The PSG’s position was reversed, however, by the “rainmaking” partners of\nAndersen who knew what their clients wanted – higher reported earnings no matter what the reality. Many\nCEOs also fought expensing because they knew that the obscene megagrants of options they craved would be\nslashed if the true costs of these had to be recorded.\nSoon after the Andersen reversal, the independent accounting standards board (FASB) voted 7-0 for\nexpensing options. Predictably, the major auditing firms and an army of CEOs stormed Washington to\npressure the Senate – what better institution to decide accounting questions? – into castrating the FASB. The\nvoices of the protesters were amplified by their large political contributions, usually made with corporate\nmoney belonging to the very owners about to be bamboozled. It was not a sight for a civics class.\nTo its shame, the Senate voted 88-9 against expensing. Several prominent Senators even called for\nthe demise of the FASB if it didn’t abandon its position. (So much for independence.) Arthur Levitt, Jr., then\nChairman of the SEC – and generally a vigilant champion of shareholders – has since described his reluctant\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nbowing to Congressional and corporate pressures as the act of his chairmanship that he most regrets. (The\ndetails of this sordid affair are related in Levitt’s excellent book, Take on the Street.)\nWith the Senate in its pocket and the SEC outgunned, corporate America knew that it was now boss\nwhen it came to accounting. With that, a new era of anything-goes earnings reports – blessed and, in some\ncases, encouraged by big-name auditors – was launched. The licentious behavior that followed quickly\nbecame an air pump for The Great Bubble.\nAfter being threatened by the Senate, FASB backed off its original position and adopted an “honor\nsystem” approach, declaring expensing to be preferable but also allowing companies to ignore the cost if they\nwished. The disheartening result: Of the 500 companies in the S&P, 498 adopted the method deemed less\ndesirable, which of course let them report higher “earnings.” Compensation-hungry CEOs loved this\noutcome: Let FASB have the honor; they had the system.\nIn our 1992 annual report, discussing the unseemly and self-serving behavior of so many CEOs, I\nsaid “the business elite risks losing its credibility on issues of significance to society – about which it may\nhave much of value to say – when it advocates the incredible on issues of significance to itself.”\nThat loss of credibility has occurred. The job of CEOs is now to regain America’s trust – and for the\ncountry’s sake it’s important that they do so. They will not succeed in this endeavor, however, by way of\nfatuous ads, meaningless policy statements, or structural changes of boards and committees. Instead, CEOs\nmust embrace stewardship as a way of life and treat their owners as partners, not patsies. It’s time for CEOs\nto walk the walk.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThree suggestions for investors: First, beware of companies displaying weak accounting. If a\ncompany still does not expense options, or if its pension assumptions are fanciful, watch out. When\nmanagements take the low road in aspects that are visible, it is likely they are following a similar path behind\nthe scenes. There is seldom just one cockroach in the kitchen.\nTrumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly\npernicious practice. Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a “non-cash”\ncharge. That’s nonsense. In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay\nit represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business. Imagine, if\nyou will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid all of its employees for the next ten years of their\nservice (in the way they would lay out cash for a fixed asset to be useful for ten years). In the following nine\nyears, compensation would be a “non-cash” expense – a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset\nestablished this year. Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two through ten\nwould be simply a bookkeeping formality?\nSecond, unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management. If you can’t\nunderstand a footnote or other managerial explanation, it’s usually because the CEO doesn’t want you to.\nEnron’s descriptions of certain transactions still baffle me.\nFinally, be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations.\nBusinesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don’t advance\nsmoothly (except, of course, in the offering books of investment bankers).\nCharlie and I not only don’t know today what our businesses will earn next year – we don’t even\nknow what they will earn next quarter. We are suspicious of those CEOs who regularly claim they do know\nthe future – and we become downright incredulous if they consistently reach their declared targets. Managers\nthat always promise to “make the numbers” will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers.",

    "chunk_text": "The Annual Meeting\n\nThe Annual Meeting\nThis year’s annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3, and once again we will be at the Civic\nAuditorium. The doors will open at 7 a. m., the movie will begin at 8: 30, and the meeting itself will\ncommence at 9: 30. There will be a short break at noon for food. (Sandwiches will be available at the Civic’s\nconcession stands.) That interlude aside, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3: 30. Give us your best\nshot.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. They do a\nterrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it.\nIn our usual fashion, we will run vans from the larger hotels to the meeting. Afterwards, the vans\nwill make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport. Even so, you\nare likely to find a car useful.\nOur exhibit area for Berkshire goods and services will be bigger and better than ever this year. So be\nprepared to spend. I think you will particularly enjoy visiting The Pampered Chef display, where you may\nrun into Doris and Sheila.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 41 of the 49 jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you\nmoney.\nOn Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from Net Jets® available\nfor your inspection. Just ask a representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes. If you buy what\nwe consider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take\nthem home. Furthermore, if you buy a fraction of a plane, I’ll personally see that you get a three-pack of\nbriefs from Fruit of the Loom.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a\ndiscount that is customarily given only to employees. We initiated this special pricing at NFM six years ago,\nand sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $14.2 million in 2002.\nTo get the discount, you must make your purchases during the Thursday, May 1 through Monday,\nMay 5 period and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the\nproducts of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but that,\nin the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.\nNFM is open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m. on weekdays and 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on Sundays. On Saturday this year,\nfrom 6 p. m. to 10 p. m., we are having a special affair for shareholders only. I’ll be there, eating hot dogs and\ndrinking Coke.\nBorsheim’s  the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store  will\nhave two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p. m. to 10 p. m. on Friday,\nMay 2. The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. on Sunday, May 4. Ask Charlie to\nautograph your sales ticket.\nShareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large\ncrowds that will assemble on Friday evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nshareholder. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p. m. Borsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully\ntwenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the more you buy, the more you save (or at least\nthat’s what my wife and daughter tell me).\nIn the mall outside of Borsheim’s, we will have some of the world’s top bridge experts available to\nplay with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. We expect Bob Hamman, Sharon Osberg, Fred Gitelman\nand Sheri Winestock to host tables. Patrick Wolff, twice U. S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking\non all comers  blindfolded! Last year, Patrick played six games simultaneously  with his blindfold\nsecurely in place  and for the first time suffered a loss. (He won the other five games, however.) He’s\nbeen training overtime ever since and is planning to start a new streak this year.\nAdditionally, Bill Robertie, one of only two players who have twice won the backgammon world\nchampionship, will be on hand to test your skill at that game. Finally, we will have a newcomer: Peter\nMorris, the winner of the World Scrabble Championship in 1991. Peter will play on five boards\nsimultaneously (no blindfold for him, however) and will also allow his challengers to consult a Scrabble\ndictionary.\nWe are also going to test your vocal chords at the mall. My friend, Al Oehrle of Philadelphia, will\nbe at the piano to play any song in any key. Susie and I will lead the singing. She is good.\nGorat’s  my favorite steakhouse  will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on\nSunday, May 4, and will be serving from 4 p. m. until 10 p. m. Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on\nSunday, you must have a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before). If\nSunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town. Show your sophistication by\nordering a rare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.\nThere won’t be a ball game this year. After my fastball was clocked at 5 mph last year, I decided to\nhang up my spikes. So I’ll see you on Saturday night at NFM instead.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nNext year our meeting will be held at Omaha’s new convention center. This switch in locations will\nallow us to hold the event on either Saturday or Monday, whichever the majority of you prefer. Using the\nenclosed special ballot, please vote for your preference – but only if you are likely to attend in the future.\nWe will make the Saturday/Monday decision based upon a count of shareholders, not shares. That\nis, a Class B shareholder owning one share will have a vote equal to that of a Class A shareholder owning\nmany shares. If the vote is close, we will go with the preference of out-of-towners.\nAgain, please vote only if there is a reasonable chance that you will be attending some meetings in\nthe future.\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 21,2003 Chairman of the Board",
