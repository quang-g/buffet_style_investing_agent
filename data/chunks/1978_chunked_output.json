    "content": "Opening & Accounting / Performance Summary\n\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nFirst, a few words about accounting. The merger with\nDiversified Retailing Company, Inc. at yearend adds two new\ncomplications in the presentation of our financial results.\nAfter the merger, our ownership of Blue Chip Stamps increased to\napproximately 58% and, therefore, the accounts of that company\nmust be fully consolidated in the Balance Sheet and Statement of\nEarnings presentation of Berkshire. In previous reports, our\nshare of the net earnings only of Blue Chip had been included as\na single item on Berkshires Statement of Earnings, and there had\nbeen a similar one-line inclusion on our Balance Sheet of our\nshare of their net assets.\n\nThis full consolidation of sales, expenses, receivables,\ninventories, debt, etc. produces an aggregation of figures from\nmany diverse businesses - textiles, insurance, candy, newspapers,\ntrading stamps - with dramatically different economic\ncharacteristics. In some of these your ownership is 100% but, in\nthose businesses which are owned by Blue Chip but fully\nconsolidated, your ownership as a Berkshire shareholder is only\n58%. (Ownership by others of the balance of these businesses is\naccounted for by the large minority interest item on the\nliability side of the Balance Sheet.) Such a grouping of Balance\nSheet and Earnings items - some wholly owned, some partly owned -\ntends to obscure economic reality more than illuminate it. In\nfact, it represents a form of presentation that we never prepare\nfor internal use during the year and which is of no value to us\nin any management activities.\n\nFor that reason, throughout the report we provide much\nseparate financial information and commentary on the various\nsegments of the business to help you evaluate Berkshires\nperformance and prospects. Much of this segmented information is\nmandated by SEC disclosure rules and covered in Managements\nDiscussion on pages 29 to 34. And in this letter we try to\npresent to you a view of our various operating entities from the\nsame perspective that we view them managerially.\n\nA second complication arising from the merger is that the\n1977 figures shown in this report are different from the 1977\nfigures shown in the report we mailed to you last year.\nAccounting convention requires that when two entities such as\nDiversified and Berkshire are merged, all financial data\nsubsequently must be presented as if the companies had been\nmerged at the time they were formed rather than just recently.\nSo the enclosed financial statements, in effect, pretend that in\n1977 (and earlier years) the Diversified-Berkshire merger already\nhad taken place, even though the actual merger date was December\n30,1978. This shifting base makes comparative commentary\nconfusing and, from time to time in our narrative report, we will\ntalk of figures and performance for Berkshire shareholders as\nhistorically reported to you rather than as restated after the\nDiversified merger.\n\nWith that preamble it can be stated that, with or without\nrestated figures, 1978 was a good year. Operating earnings,\nexclusive of capital gains, at 19.4% of beginning shareholders\ninvestment were within a fraction of our 1972 record. While we\nbelieve it is improper to include capital gains or losses in\nevaluating the performance of a single year, they are an\nimportant component of the longer term record. Because of such\ngains, Berkshires long-term growth in equity per share has been\ngreater than would be indicated by compounding the returns from\noperating earnings that we have reported annually.\n\nFor example, over the last three years - generally a bonanza\nperiod for the insurance industry, our largest profit producer -\nBerkshires per share net worth virtually has doubled, thereby\ncompounding at about 25% annually through a combination of good\noperating earnings and fairly substantial capital gains. Neither\nthis 25% equity gain from all sources nor the 19.4% equity gain\nfrom operating earnings in 1978 is sustainable. The insurance\ncycle has turned downward in 1979, and it is almost certain that\noperating earnings measured by return on equity will fall this\nyear. However, operating earnings measured in dollars are likely\nto increase on the much larger shareholders equity now employed\nin the business.\n\nIn contrast to this cautious view about near term return\nfrom operations, we are optimistic about prospects for long term\nreturn from major equity investments held by our insurance\ncompanies. We make no attempt to predict how security markets\nwill behave; successfully forecasting short term stock price\nmovements is something we think neither we nor anyone else can\ndo. In the longer run, however, we feel that many of our major\nequity holdings are going to be worth considerably more money\nthan we paid, and that investment gains will add significantly to\nthe operating returns of the insurance group."

    "content": "Insurance Underwriting\n\nThe number one contributor to Berkshires overall excellent\nresults in 1978 was the segment of National Indemnity Companys\ninsurance operation run by Phil Liesche. On about $90 million of\nearned premiums, an underwriting profit of approximately $11\nmillion was realized, a truly extraordinary achievement even\nagainst the background of excellent industry conditions. Under\nPhils leadership, with outstanding assistance by Roland Miller\nin Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims, this segment of\nNational Indemnity (including National Fire and Marine Insurance\nCompany, which operates as a running mate) had one of its best\nyears in a long history of performances which, in aggregate, far\noutshine those of the industry. Present successes reflect credit\nnot only upon present managers, but equally upon the business\ntalents of Jack Ringwalt, founder of National Indemnity, whose\noperating philosophy remains etched upon the company.\n\nHome and Automobile Insurance Company had its best year\nsince John Seward stepped in and straightened things out in 1975.\nIts results are combined in this report with those of Phil\nLiesches operation under the insurance category entitled\nSpecialized Auto and General Liability.\n\nWorkers Compensation was a mixed bag in 1978. In its first\nyear as a subsidiary, Cypress Insurance Company, managed by Milt\nThornton, turned in outstanding results. The workers\ncompensation line can cause large underwriting losses when rapid\ninflation interacts with changing social concepts, but Milt has a\ncautious and highly professional staff to cope with these\nproblems. His performance in 1978 has reinforced our very good\nfeelings about this purchase.\n\nFrank De Nardo came with us in the spring of 1978 to\nstraighten out National Indemnitys California Workers\nCompensation business which, up to that point, had been a\ndisaster. Frank has the experience and intellect needed to\ncorrect the major problems of the Los Angeles office. Our volume\nin this department now is running only about 25% of what it was\neighteen months ago, and early indications are that Frank is\nmaking good progress.\n\nGeorge Youngs reinsurance department continues to produce\nvery large sums for investment relative to premium volume, and\nthus gives us reasonably satisfactory overall results. However,\nunderwriting results still are not what they should be and can\nbe. It is very easy to fool yourself regarding underwriting\nresults in reinsurance (particularly in casualty lines involving\nlong delays in settlement), and we believe this situation\nprevails with many of our competitors. Unfortunately, selfdelusion in company reserving almost always leads to inadequate\nindustry rate levels. If major factors in the market dont know\ntheir true costs, the competitive fall-out hits all - even\nthose with adequate cost knowledge. George is quite willing to\nreduce volume significantly, if needed, to achieve satisfactory\nunderwriting, and we have a great deal of confidence in the long\nterm soundness of this business under his direction.\n\nThe homestate operation was disappointing in 1978. Our\nunsatisfactory underwriting, even though partially explained by\nan unusual incidence of Midwestern storms, is particularly\nworrisome against the backdrop of very favorable industry results\nin the conventional lines written by our homestate group. We\nhave confidence in John Ringwalts ability to correct this\nsituation. The bright spot in the group was the performance of\nKansas Fire and Casualty in its first full year of business.\nUnder Floyd Taylor, this subsidiary got off to a truly remarkable\nstart. Of course, it takes at least several years to evaluate\nunderwriting results, but the early signs are encouraging and\nFloyds operation achieved the best loss ratio among the\nhomestate companies in 1978.\n\nAlthough some segments were disappointing, overall our\ninsurance operation had an excellent year. But of course we\nshould expect a good year when the industry is flying high, as in\n1978. It is a virtual certainty that in 1979 the combined ratio\n(see definition on page 31) for the industry will move up at\nleast a few points, perhaps enough to throw the industry as a\nwhole into an underwriting loss position. For example, in the\nauto lines - by far the most important area for the industry and\nfor us - CPI figures indicate rates overall were only 3% higher\nin January 1979 than a year ago. But the items that make up loss\ncosts - auto repair and medical care costs - were up over 9%.\nHow different than yearend 1976 when rates had advanced over 22%\nin the preceding twelve months, but costs were up 8%.\n\nMargins will remain steady only if rates rise as fast as\ncosts. This assuredly will not be the case in 1979, and\nconditions probably will worsen in 1980. Our present thinking is\nthat our underwriting performance relative to the industry will\nimprove somewhat in 1979, but every other insurance management\nprobably views its relative prospects with similar optimism -\nsomeone is going to be disappointed. Even if we do improve\nrelative to others, we may well have a higher combined ratio and\nlower underwriting profits in 1979 than we achieved last year.\n\nWe continue to look for ways to expand our insurance\noperation. But your reaction to this intent should not be\nunrestrained joy. Some of our expansion efforts - largely\ninitiated by your Chairman have been lackluster, others have been\nexpensive failures. We entered the business in 1967 through\npurchase of the segment which Phil Liesche now manages, and it\nstill remains, by a large margin, the best portion of our\ninsurance business. It is not easy to buy a good insurance\nbusiness, but our experience has been that it is easier to buy\none than create one. However, we will continue to try both\napproaches, since the rewards for success in this field can be\nexceptional."

There were equities of identifiably excellent companies\navailable - but very few at interesting prices. (An irresistible\nfootnote: in 1971, pension fund managers invested a record 122%\nof net funds available in equities - at full prices they couldnt\nbuy enough of them. In 1974, after the bottom had fallen out,\nthey committed a then record low of 21% to stocks.)\n\nThe past few years have been a different story for us. At\nthe end of 1975 our insurance subsidiaries held common equities\nwith a market value exactly equal to cost of $39.3 million. At\nthe end of 1978 this position had been increased to equities\n(including a convertible preferred) with a cost of $129.1 million\nand a market value of $216.5 million. During the intervening\nthree years we also had realized pre-tax gains from common\nequities of approximately $24.7 million. Therefore, our overall\nunrealized and realized pre-tax gains in equities for the three\nyear period came to approximately $112 million. During this same\ninterval the Dow-Jones Industrial Average declined from 852 to\n805. It was a marvelous period for the value-oriented equity\nbuyer.\n\nWe continue to find for our insurance portfolios small\nportions of really outstanding businesses that are available,\nthrough the auction pricing mechanism of security markets, at\nprices dramatically cheaper than the valuations inferior\nbusinesses command on negotiated sales.\n\nThis program of acquisition of small fractions of businesses\n(common stocks) at bargain prices, for which little enthusiasm\nexists, contrasts sharply with general corporate acquisition\nactivity, for which much enthusiasm exists. It seems quite clear\nto us that either corporations are making very significant\nmistakes in purchasing entire businesses at prices prevailing in\nnegotiated transactions and takeover bids, or that we eventually\nare going to make considerable sums of money buying small\nportions of such businesses at the greatly discounted valuations\nprevailing in the stock market. (A second footnote: in 1978\npension managers, a group that logically should maintain the\nlongest of investment perspectives, put only 9% of net available\nfunds into equities - breaking the record low figure set in 1974\nand tied in 1977.)\n\nWe are not concerned with whether the market quickly\nrevalues upward securities that we believe are selling at bargain\nprices. In fact, we prefer just the opposite since, in most\nyears, we expect to have funds available to be a net buyer of\nsecurities. And consistent attractive purchasing is likely to\nprove to be of more eventual benefit to us than any selling\nopportunities provided by a short-term run up in stock prices to\nlevels at which we are unwilling to continue buying.\n\nOur policy is to concentrate holdings. We try to avoid\nbuying a little of this or that when we are only lukewarm about\nthe business or its price. When we are convinced as to\nattractiveness, we believe in buying worthwhile amounts.\n\nEquity holdings of our insurance companies with a market value of\nover $8 million on December 31,1978 were as follows:\n\nNo. of\nShares Company Cost Market\n---------- ------- ---------- ----------\n(000 s omitted)\n\n246,450 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. ... $ 6,082 $ 8,626\n1,294,308 Government Employees Insurance Company\nCommon Stock ......................... 4,116 9,060\n1,986,953 Government Employees Insurance Company\nConvertible Preferred ................ 19,417 28,314\n592,650 Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. .... 4,531 19,039\n1,066,934 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation 18,085 18,671\n453,800 Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc. .......... 7,534 10,267\n953,750 SAFECO Corporation ...................... 23,867 26,467\n934,300 The Washington Post Company ............. 10,628 43,445\n---------- ----------\nTotal ................................... $ 94,260 $163,889\nAll Other Holdings ...................... 39,506 57,040\n---------- ----------\nTotal Equities .......................... $133,766 $220,929\n========== ==========\n\nIn some cases our indirect interest in earning power is\nbecoming quite substantial. For example, note our holdings of\n953,750 shares of SAFECO Corp. SAFECO probably is the best run\nlarge property and casualty insurance company in the United\nStates. Their underwriting abilities are simply superb, their\nloss reserving is conservative, and their investment policies\nmake great sense.\n\nSAFECO is a much better insurance operation than our own\n(although we believe certain segments of ours are much better\nthan average), is better than one we could develop and,\nsimilarly, is far better than any in which we might negotiate\npurchase of a controlling interest. Yet our purchase of SAFECO\nwas made at substantially under book value. We paid less than\n100 cents on the dollar for the best company in the business,\nwhen far more than 100 cents on the dollar is being paid for\nmediocre companies in corporate transactions. And there is no\nway to start a new operation - with necessarily uncertain\nprospects - at less than 100 cents on the dollar.\n\nOf course, with a minor interest we do not have the right to\ndirect or even influence management policies of SAFECO. But why\nshould we wish to do this? The record would indicate that they\ndo a better job of managing their operations than we could do\nourselves. While there may be less excitement and prestige in\nsitting back and letting others do the work, we think that is all\none loses by accepting a passive participation in excellent\nmanagement. Because, quite clearly, if one controlled a company\nrun as well as SAFECO, the proper policy also would be to sit\nback and let management do its job.\n\nEarnings attributable to the shares of SAFECO owned by\nBerkshire at yearend amounted to $6.1 million during 1978, but\nonly the dividends received (about 18% of earnings) are reflected\nin our operating earnings. We believe the balance, although not\nreportable, to be just as real in terms of eventual benefit to us\nas the amount distributed. In fact, SAFECOs retained earnings\n(or those of other well-run companies if they have opportunities\nto employ additional capital advantageously) may well eventually\nhave a value to shareholders greater than 100 cents on the\ndollar.\n\nWe are not at all unhappy when our wholly-owned businesses\nretain all of their earnings if they can utilize internally those\nfunds at attractive rates. Why should we feel differently about\nretention of earnings by companies in which we hold small equity\ninterests, but where the record indicates even better prospects\nfor profitable employment of capital? (This proposition cuts the\nother way, of course, in industries with low capital\nrequirements, or if management has a record of plowing capital\ninto projects of low profitability; then earnings should be paid\nout or used to repurchase shares - often by far the most\nattractive option for capital utilization.)\n\nThe aggregate level of such retained earnings attributable\nto our equity interests in fine companies is becoming quite\nsubstantial. It does not enter into our reported operating\nearnings, but we feel it well may have equal long-term\nsignificance to our shareholders. Our hope is that conditions\ncontinue to prevail in securities markets which allow our\ninsurance companies to buy large amounts of underlying earning\npower for relatively modest outlays. At some point market\nconditions undoubtedly will again preclude such bargain buying\nbut, in the meantime, we will try to make the most of\nopportunities."

It seems quite clear\nto us that either corporations are making very significant\nmistakes in purchasing entire businesses at prices prevailing in\nnegotiated transactions and takeover bids, or that we eventually\nare going to make considerable sums of money buying small\nportions of such businesses at the greatly discounted valuations\nprevailing in the stock market. (A second footnote: in 1978\npension managers, a group that logically should maintain the\nlongest of investment perspectives, put only 9% of net available\nfunds into equities - breaking the record low figure set in 1974\nand tied in 1977.)",
