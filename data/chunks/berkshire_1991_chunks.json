    "chunk_text": "Opening Performance Summary\n\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1991 was $2.1 billion, or\n39.6%. Over the last 27 years (that is, since present management\ntook over) our per-share book value has grown from $19 to $6,437,\nor at a rate of 23.7% compounded annually.\n\nThe size of our equity capital - which now totals $7.4\nbillion - makes it certain that we cannot maintain our past rate\nof gain or, for that matter, come close to doing so. As Berkshire\ngrows, the universe of opportunities that can significantly\ninfluence the company's performance constantly shrinks. When we\nwere working with capital of $20 million, an idea or business\nproducing $1 million of profit added five percentage points to\nour return for the year. Now we need a $370 million idea (i. e.,\none contributing over $550 million of pre-tax profit) to achieve\nthe same result. And there are many more ways to make $1 million\nthan to make $370 million.\n\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman, and I have set a\ngoal of attaining a 15% average annual increase in Berkshire's\nintrinsic value. If our growth in\nbook\nvalue is to keep up with a\n15% pace, we must earn $22 billion during the next decade. Wish\nus luck - we'll need it.\n\nOur outsized gain in book value in 1991 resulted from a\nphenomenon not apt to be repeated: a dramatic rise in the priceearnings ratios of Coca-Cola and Gillette. These two stocks\naccounted for nearly $1.6 billion of our $2.1 billion growth in\nnet worth last year. When we loaded up on Coke three years ago,\nBerkshire's net worth was $3.4 billion; now our Coke stock alone\nis worth more than that.\n\nCoca-Cola and Gillette are two of the best companies in the\nworld and we expect their earnings to grow at hefty rates in the\nyears ahead. Over time, also, the value of our holdings in these\nstocks should grow in rough proportion. Last year, however, the\nvaluations of these two companies rose far faster than their\nearnings. In effect, we got a double-dip benefit, delivered\npartly by the excellent earnings growth and even more so by the\nmarket's reappraisal of these stocks. We believe this reappraisal\nwas warranted. But it can't recur annually: We'll have to settle\nfor a single dip in the future.\n",

    "chunk_text": "A Second Job\n\nIn 1989 when I - a happy consumer of five cans of Cherry\nCoke daily - announced our purchase of $1 billion worth of Coca Cola stock, I described the move as a rather extreme example of\nputting our money where my mouth was. On August 18 of last year,\nwhen I was elected Interim Chairman of Salomon Inc, it was a\ndifferent story: I put my mouth where our money was.\n\nYou've all read of the events that led to my appointment. My\ndecision to take the job carried with it an implicit but\nimportant message: Berkshire's operating managers are so\noutstanding that I knew I could materially reduce the time I was\nspending at the company and yet remain confident that its\neconomic progress would not skip a beat. The Blumkins, the\nFriedman family, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan\nLipsey, Ralph Schey and Frank Rooney (CEO of H. H. Brown, our\nlatest acquisition, which I will describe later) are all masters\nof their operations and need no help from me. My job is merely to\ntreat them right and to allocate the capital they generate.\nNeither function is impeded by my work at Salomon.\n\nThe role that Charlie and I play in the success of our\noperating units can be illustrated by a story about George Mira,\nthe one-time quarterback of the University of Miami, and his\ncoach, Andy Gustafson. Playing Florida and near its goal line,\nMira dropped back to pass. He spotted an open receiver but found\nhis right shoulder in the unshakable grasp of a Florida\nlinebacker. The right-handed Mira thereupon switched the ball to\nhis other hand and threw the only left-handed pass of his life -\nfor a touchdown. As the crowd erupted, Gustafson calmly turned to\na reporter and declared: \"Now that's what I call coaching.\"\n\nGiven the managerial stars we have at our operating units,\nBerkshire's performance is not affected if Charlie or I slip away\nfrom time to time. You should note, however, the \"interim\" in my\nSalomon title. Berkshire is my first love and one that will never\nfade: At the Harvard Business School last year, a student asked\nme when I planned to retire and I replied, \"About five to ten\nyears after I die.\"\n",

This procedure lets\nyou view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been\nreported had we not purchased them. I've explained in past\nreports why this form of presentation seems to us to be more\nuseful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchaseprice adjustments to be made on a business-by-business basis. The\ntotal net earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical\nto the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\n\nA large amount of additional information about these\nbusinesses is given on pages 33-47, where you also will find\nour segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. However, we will\nnot in this letter discuss each of our non-insurance operations,\nas we have in the past.

    "chunk_text": "A Change in Media Economics and Some Valuation Math\n\nIn last year's report, I stated my opinion that the decline in\nthe profitability of media companies reflected secular as well as\ncyclical factors. The events of 1991 have fortified that case: The\neconomic strength of once-mighty media enterprises continues to\nerode as retailing patterns change and advertising and\nentertainment choices proliferate. In the business world,\nunfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the\nwindshield: A few years back no one linked to the media business -\nneither lenders, owners nor financial analysts - saw the economic\ndeterioration that was in store for the industry. (But give me a\nfew years and I'll probably convince myself that I did.)\n\nThe fact is that newspaper, television, and magazine\nproperties have begun to resemble\nbusinesses\nmore than\nfranchises\n\nin their economic behavior. Let's take a quick look at the\ncharacteristics separating these two classes of enterprise, keeping\nin mind, however, that many operations fall in some middle ground\nand can best be described as weak franchises or strong businesses.\n\nAn economic franchise arises from a product or service that:\n(1) is needed or desired; (2) is thought by its customers to have\nno close substitute and; (3) is not subject to price regulation.\nThe existence of all three conditions will be demonstrated by a\ncompany's ability to regularly price its product or service\naggressively and thereby to earn high rates of return on capital.\nMoreover, franchises can tolerate mis-management. Inept managers\nmay diminish a franchise's profitability, but they cannot inflict\nmortal damage.\n\nIn contrast, \"a business\" earns exceptional profits only if it\nis the low-cost operator or if supply of its product or service is\ntight. Tightness in supply usually does not last long. With\nsuperior management, a company may maintain its status as a lowcost operator for a much longer time, but even then unceasingly\nfaces the possibility of competitive attack. And a business, unlike\na franchise, can be killed by poor management.\n\nUntil recently, media properties possessed the three\ncharacteristics of a franchise and consequently could both price\naggressively and be managed loosely. Now, however, consumers\nlooking for information and entertainment (their primary interest\nbeing the latter) enjoy greatly broadened choices as to where to\nfind them. Unfortunately, demand can't expand in response to this\nnew supply: 500 million American eyeballs and a 24-hour day are all\nthat's available. The result is that competition has intensified,\nmarkets have fragmented, and the media industry has lost some -\nthough far from all - of its franchise strength.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThe industry's weakened franchise has an impact on its value\nthat goes far beyond the immediate effect on earnings. For an\nunderstanding of this phenomenon, let's look at some much oversimplified, but relevant, math.\n\nA few years ago the conventional wisdom held that a newspaper,\ntelevision or magazine property would forever increase its earnings\nat 6% or so annually and would do so\nwithout the employment of\nadditional capital\n, for the reason that depreciation charges would\nroughly match capital expenditures and working capital requirements\nwould be minor. Therefore, reported earnings (before amortization\nof intangibles) were also freely-distributable earnings, which\nmeant that ownership of a media property could be construed as akin\nto owning a perpetual annuity set to grow at 6% a year. Say, next,\nthat a discount rate of 10% was used to determine the present value\nof that earnings stream. One could then calculate that it was\nappropriate to pay a whopping $25 million for a property with\ncurrent after-tax earnings of $1 million. (This after-tax multiplier\nof 25 translates to a multiplier on pre-tax earnings of about 16.)\n\nNow change the assumption and posit that the $1 million\nrepresents \"normal earning power\" and that earnings will bob around\nthis figure cyclically. A \"bob-around\" pattern is indeed the lot of\nmost businesses, whose income stream grows only if their owners are\nwilling to commit more capital (usually in the form of retained\nearnings). Under our revised assumption, $1 million of earnings,\ndiscounted by the same 10%, translates to a $10 million valuation.\nThus a seemingly modest shift in assumptions reduces the property's\nvaluation to 10 times after-tax earnings (or about 6 1/2 times\npre-tax earnings).\n\nDollars are dollars whether they are derived from the\noperation of media properties or of steel mills. What in the past\ncaused buyers to value a dollar of earnings from media far higher\nthan a dollar from steel was that the earnings of a media property\nwere expected to constantly grow (without the business requiring\nmuch additional capital), whereas steel earnings clearly fell in\nthe bob-around category. Now, however, expectations for media have\nmoved toward the bob-around model. And, as our simplified example\nillustrates, valuations must change dramatically when expectations\nare revised.\n\nWe have a significant investment in media - both through our\ndirect ownership of Buffalo News and our shareholdings in The\nWashington Post Company and Capital Cities/ABC - and the intrinsic\nvalue of this investment has declined materially because of the\nsecular transformation that the industry is experiencing. (Cyclical\nfactors have also hurt our current look-through earnings, but these\nfactors do not reduce intrinsic value.) However, as our Business\nPrinciples on page 2-3 note, one of the rules by which we run\nBerkshire is that we do not sell businesses - or investee holdings\nthat we have classified as permanent - simply because we see ways\nto use the money more advantageously elsewhere. (We did sell\ncertain other media holdings sometime back, but these were\nrelatively small.)\n\nThe intrinsic value losses that we have suffered have been\nmoderated because the Buffalo News, under Stan Lipsey's leadership,\nhas done far better than most newspapers and because both Cap\nCities and Washington Post are exceptionally well-managed. In\nparticular, these companies stayed on the sidelines during the late\n1980's period in which purchasers of media properties regularly\npaid irrational prices. Also, the debt of both Cap Cities and\nWashington Post is small and roughly offset by cash that they hold.\nAs a result, the shrinkage in the value of their assets has not\nbeen accentuated by the effects of leverage. Among publicly-owned\nmedia companies, our two investees are about the only ones\nessentially free of debt. Most of the other companies, through a\ncombination of the aggressive acquisition policies they pursued and\nshrinking earnings, find themselves with debt equal to five or more\ntimes their current net income.\n\nThe strong balance sheets and strong managements of Cap Cities\nand Washington Post leave us more comfortable with these\ninvestments than we would be with holdings in any other media\ncompanies. Moreover, most media properties continue to have far\nbetter economic characteristics than those possessed by the average\nAmerican business. But gone are the days of bullet-proof franchises\nand cornucopian economics.\n",

    "chunk_text": "Twenty Years in a Candy Store\n\nWe've just passed a milestone: Twenty years ago, on January 3,1972, Blue Chip Stamps (then an affiliate of Berkshire and later\nmerged into it) bought control of See's Candy Shops, a West Coast\nmanufacturer and retailer of boxed-chocolates. The nominal price\nthat the sellers were asking - calculated on the 100% ownership we\nultimately attained - was $40 million. But the company had $10\nmillion of excess cash, and therefore the true offering price was\n$30 million. Charlie and I, not yet fully appreciative of the value\nof an economic franchise, looked at the company's mere $7 million\nof tangible net worth and said $25 million was as high as we would\ngo (and we meant it). Fortunately, the sellers accepted our offer.\n\nThe sales of trading stamps by Blue Chip thereafter declined\nfrom $102.5 million in 1972 to $1.2 million in 1991. But See's\ncandy sales in the same period increased from $29 million to $196\nmillion. Moreover, profits at See's grew even faster than sales,\nfrom $4.2 million pre-tax in 1972 to $42.4 million last year.\n\nFor an increase in profits to be evaluated properly, it must\nbe compared with the incremental capital investment required to\nproduce it. On this score, See's has been astounding: The company\nnow operates comfortably with only $25 million of net worth, which\nmeans that our beginning base of $7 million has had to be\nsupplemented by only $18 million of reinvested earnings. Meanwhile,\nSee's remaining pre-tax profits of $410 million were distributed to\nBlue Chip/Berkshire during the 20 years for these companies to\ndeploy (after payment of taxes) in whatever way made most sense.\n\nIn our See's purchase, Charlie and I had one important\ninsight: We saw that the business had untapped pricing power.\nOtherwise, we were lucky twice over. First, the transaction was not\nderailed by our dumb insistence on a $25 million price. Second, we\nfound Chuck Huggins, then See's executive vice-president, whom we\ninstantly put in charge. Both our business and personal experiences\nwith Chuck have been outstanding. One example: When the purchase\nwas made, we shook hands with Chuck on a compensation arrangement -\nconceived in about five minutes and never reduced to a written\ncontract - that remains unchanged to this day.\n\nIn 1991, See's sales volume, measured in dollars, matched that\nof 1990. In pounds, however, volume was down 4%. All of that\nslippage took place in the last two months of the year, a period\nthat normally produces more than 80% of annual profits. Despite the\nweakness in sales, profits last year grew 7%, and our pre-tax\nprofit margin was a record 21.6%.\n\nAlmost 80% of See's sales come from California and our\nbusiness clearly was hurt by the recession, which hit the state\nwith particular force late in the year. Another negative, however,\nwas the mid-year initiation in California of a sales tax of 7%-8%\n(depending on the county involved) on \"snack food\" that was deemed\napplicable to our candy.\n\nShareholders who are students of epistemological shadings will\nenjoy California's classifications of \"snack\" and \"non-snack\"\nfoods:\n\nTaxable \"Snack\" Foods Non-Taxable \"Non-Snack\" Foods\n--------------------- -----------------------------\nRitz Crackers Soda Crackers\nPopped Popcorn Unpopped Popcorn\nGranola Bars Granola Cereal\nSlice of Pie (Wrapped) Whole Pie\nMilky Way Candy Bar Milky Way Ice Cream Bar\n\nWhat - you are sure to ask - is the tax status of a\nmelted\n\nMilky Way ice cream bar? In that androgynous form, does it more\nresemble an ice cream bar or a candy bar that has been left in the\nsun? It's no wonder that Brad Sherman, Chairman of California's\nState Board of Equalization, who opposed the snack food bill but\nmust now administer it, has said: \"I came to this job as a\nspecialist in tax law. Now I find my constituents should have\nelected Julia Child.\"\n\nCharlie and I have many reasons to be thankful for our\nassociation with Chuck and See's. The obvious ones are that we've\nearned exceptional returns and had a good time in the process.\nEqually important, ownership of See's has taught us much about the\nevaluation of franchises. We've made significant money in certain\ncommon stocks because of the lessons we learned at See's.\n",

    "chunk_text": "H. H. Brown\n\nWe made a sizable acquisition in 1991 - the H. H. Brown\nCompany - and behind this business is an interesting history. In\n1927 a 29-year-old businessman named Ray Heffernan purchased the\ncompany, then located in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, for\n$10,000 and began a 62-year career of running it. (He also found\ntime for other pursuits: At age 90 he was still joining new golf\nclubs.) By Mr. Heffernan's retirement in early 1990 H. H. Brown had\nthree plants in the United States and one in Canada; employed close\nto 2,000 people; and earned about $25 million annually before\ntaxes.\n\nAlong the way, Frances Heffernan, one of Ray's daughters,\nmarried Frank Rooney, who was sternly advised by Mr. Heffernan\nbefore the wedding that he had better forget any ideas he might\nhave about working for his father-in-law. That was one of Mr.\nHeffernan's few mistakes: Frank went on to become CEO of Melville\nShoe (now Melville Corp.). During his 23 years as boss, from 1964\nthrough 1986, Melville's earnings averaged more than 20% on equity\nand its stock (adjusted for splits) rose from $16 to $960. And a\nfew years after Frank retired, Mr. Heffernan, who had fallen ill,\nasked him to run Brown.\n\nAfter Mr. Heffernan died late in 1990, his family decided to\nsell the company - and here we got lucky. I had known Frank for a\nfew years but not well enough for him to think of Berkshire as a\npossible buyer. He instead gave the assignment of selling Brown to\na major investment banker, which failed also to think of us. But\nlast spring Frank was playing golf in Florida with John Loomis, a\nlong-time friend of mine as well as a Berkshire shareholder, who is\nalways on the alert for something that might fit us. Hearing about\nthe impending sale of Brown, John told Frank that the company\nshould be right up Berkshire's alley, and Frank promptly gave me a\ncall. I thought right away that we would make a deal and before\nlong it was done.\n\nMuch of my enthusiasm for this purchase came from Frank's\nwillingness to continue as CEO. Like most of our managers, he has\nno financial need to work but does so because he loves the game and\nlikes to excel. Managers of this stripe cannot be \"hired\" in the\nnormal sense of the word. What we must do is provide a concert hall\nin which business artists of this class will wish to perform.\n\nBrown (which, by the way, has no connection to Brown Shoe of\nSt. Louis) is the leading North American manufacturer of work shoes\nand boots, and it has a history of earning unusually fine margins\non sales and assets. Shoes are a tough business - of the billion\npairs purchased in the United States each year, about 85% are\nimported - and most manufacturers in the industry do poorly. The\nwide range of styles and sizes that producers offer causes\ninventories to be heavy; substantial capital is also tied up in\nreceivables. In this kind of environment, only outstanding managers\nlike Frank and the group developed by Mr. Heffernan can prosper.\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of H. H. Brown is one of the\nmost unusual compensation systems I've encountered - but one that\nwarms my heart: A number of key managers are paid an annual salary\nof $7,800, to which is added a designated percentage of the profits\nof the company after these are reduced by a charge for capital\nemployed. These managers therefore truly stand in the shoes of\nowners. In contrast, most managers talk the talk but don't walk the\nwalk, choosing instead to employ compensation systems that are long\non carrots but short on sticks (and that almost invariably treat\nequity capital as if it were cost-free). The arrangement at Brown,\nin any case, has served both the company and its managers\nexceptionally well, which should be no surprise: Managers eager to\nbet heavily on their abilities usually have plenty of ability to\nbet on.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n",

In the other\nthree cases, I myself or a friend initiated the transaction at some\npoint after the investment bank had solicited its own list of\nprospects. We would love to see an intermediary earn its fee by\nthinking of us - and therefore repeat here what we're looking for:\n\n(1) Large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections\nare of little interest to us, nor are \"turnaround\"\nsituations),\n(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing\nlittle or no debt,\n(4) Management in place (we can't supply it),\n(5) Simple businesses (if there's lots of technology, we\nwon't understand it),\n(6) An offering price (we don't want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\n\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether we're interested. (With Brown,\nwe didn't even need to take five.) We prefer to buy for cash, but\nwill consider issuing stock when we receive as much in intrinsic\nbusiness value as we give.\n\nOur favorite form of purchase is one fitting the pattern\nthrough which we acquired Nebraska Furniture Mart, Fechheimer's and\nBorsheim's. In cases like these, the company's owner-managers wish\nto generate significant amounts of cash, sometimes for themselves,\nbut often for their families or inactive shareholders. At the same\ntime, these managers wish to remain significant owners who continue\nto run their companies just as they have in the past. We think we\noffer a particularly good fit for owners with such objectives and\nwe invite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past.\n\nCharlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions\nthat don't come close to meeting our tests: We've found that if\nyou advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will\ncall hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels.

We are not interested, however, in receiving\nsuggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock\nmarket.\n",

    "chunk_text": "Insurance Operations\n\nBerkshire continues to be a very large writer - perhaps the\nlargest in the world - of \"super-cat\" insurance, which is coverage\nthat other insurance companies buy to protect themselves against\nmajor catastrophic losses. Profits in this business are enormously\nvolatile. As I mentioned last year, $100 million in super-cat\npremiums, which is roughly our annual expectation, could deliver us\nanything from a $100 million profit (in a year with no big\ncatastrophe) to a $200 million loss (in a year in which a couple of\nmajor hurricanes and/or earthquakes come along).\n\nWe price this business expecting to pay out, over the long\nterm, about 90% of the premiums we receive. In any given year,\nhowever, we are likely to appear either enormously profitable or\nenormously unprofitable. That is true in part because GAAP\naccounting does not allow us to set up reserves in the catastrophefree years for losses that are certain to be experienced in other\nyears. In effect, a one-year accounting cycle is ill-suited to the\nnature of this business - and that is a reality you should be aware\nof when you assess our annual results.\n\nLast year there appears to have been, by our definition, one\nsuper-cat, but it will trigger payments from only about 25% of our\npolicies. Therefore, we currently estimate the 1991 underwriting\nprofit from our catastrophe business to have been about $11\nmillion. (You may be surprised to learn the identity of the biggest\ncatastrophe in 1991: It was neither the Oakland fire nor Hurricane\nBob, but rather a September typhoon in Japan that caused the\nindustry an insured loss now estimated at about $4-$5 billion. At\nthe higher figure, the loss from the typhoon would surpass that\nfrom Hurricane Hugo, the previous record-holder.)\n\nInsurers will always need huge amounts of reinsurance\nprotection for marine and aviation disasters as well as for natural\ncatastrophes. In the 1980's much of this reinsurance was supplied\nby \"innocents\" - that is, by insurers that did not understand the\nrisks of the business - but they have now been financially burned\nbeyond recognition. (Berkshire itself was an innocent all too often\nwhen I was personally running the insurance operation.) Insurers,\nthough, like investors, eventually repeat their mistakes. At some\npoint - probably after a few catastrophe-scarce years - innocents\nwill reappear and prices for super-cat policies will plunge to\nsilly levels.\n\nAs long as apparently-adequate rates prevail, however, we will\nbe a major participant in super-cat coverages. In marketing this\nproduct, we enjoy a significant competitive advantage because of\nour premier financial strength. Thinking insurers know that when\n\"the big one\" comes, many reinsurers who found it easy to write\npolicies will find it difficult to write checks. (Some reinsurers\ncan say what Jackie Mason does: \"I'm fixed for life - as long as I\ndon't buy anything.\") Berkshire's ability to fulfill all its\ncommitments under conditions of even extreme adversity is\nunquestioned.\n\nOverall, insurance offers Berkshire its greatest\nopportunities. Mike Goldberg has accomplished wonders with this\noperation since he took charge and it has become a very valuable\nasset, albeit one that can't be appraised with any precision.\n",

Indeed, in the sense\nof where they earn their profits - continent-by-continent - Coca Cola and Guinness display strong similarities. (But you'll never\nget their drinks confused - and your Chairman remains unmovably in\nthe Cherry Coke camp.)\n\nWe continually search for large businesses with\nunderstandable, enduring and mouth-watering economics that are run\nby able and shareholder-oriented managements. This focus doesn't\nguarantee results: We both have to buy at a sensible price and get\nbusiness performance from our companies that validates our\nassessment. But this investment approach - searching for the\nsuperstars - offers us our only chance for real success. Charlie\nand I are simply not smart enough, considering the large sums we\nwork with, to get great results by adroitly buying and selling\nportions of far-from-great businesses. Nor do we think many others\ncan achieve long-term investment success by flitting from flower to\nflower. Indeed, we believe that according the name \"investors\" to\ninstitutions that trade actively is like calling someone who\nrepeatedly engages in one-night stands a romantic.\n\nIf my universe of business possibilities was limited, say, to\nprivate companies in Omaha, I would, first, try to assess the longterm economic characteristics of each business; second, assess the\nquality of the people in charge of running it; and, third, try to\nbuy into a few of the best operations at a sensible price. I\ncertainly would not wish to own an equal part of every business in\ntown. Why, then, should Berkshire take a different tack when\ndealing with the larger universe of public companies? And since\nfinding great businesses and outstanding managers is so difficult,\nwhy should we discard proven products? (I was tempted to say \"the\nreal thing.\") Our motto is: \"If at first you do succeed, quit\ntrying.\"\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes, whose brilliance as a practicing investor\nmatched his brilliance in thought, wrote a letter to a business\nassociate, F. C. Scott, on August 15,1934 that says it all: \"As\ntime goes on, I get more and more convinced that the right method\nin investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which\none thinks one knows something about and in the management of which\none thoroughly believes. It is a mistake to think that one limits\none's risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which\none knows little and has no reason for special confidence. . . .\nOne's knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are\nseldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in\nwhich I personally feel myself entitled to put\nfull\nconfidence.\"\n",

My experiences in the\nfirst few years of this second \"semester\" indicate that my backlog\nof matters to be discussed will become unmanageable if I stick to\nmy original plan. Therefore, I will occasionally unburden myself in\nthese pages in the hope that public confession may deter further\nbumblings. (Post-mortems prove useful for hospitals and football\nteams; why not for businesses and investors?)\n\nTypically, our most egregious mistakes fall in the omission,\nrather than the commission, category. That may spare Charlie and me\nsome embarrassment, since you don't see these errors; but their\ninvisibility does not reduce their cost. In this mea culpa, I am\nnot talking about missing out on some company that depends upon an\nesoteric invention (such as Xerox), high-technology (Apple), or\neven brilliant merchandising (Wal-Mart). We will never develop the\ncompetence to spot such businesses early. Instead I refer to\nbusiness situations that Charlie and I can understand and that seem\nclearly attractive - but in which we nevertheless end up sucking\nour thumbs rather than buying.\n\nEvery writer knows it helps to use striking examples, but I\nwish the one I now present wasn't quite so dramatic: In early 1988,\nwe decided to buy 30 million shares (adjusted for a subsequent\nsplit) of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which\nwould have been a $350-$400 million investment. We had owned the\nstock some years earlier and understood the company's business.\nFurthermore, it was clear to us that David Maxwell, Fannie Mae's\nCEO, had dealt superbly with some problems that he had inherited\nand had established the company as a financial powerhouse - with\nthe best yet to come. I visited David in Washington and confirmed\nthat he would not be uncomfortable if we were to take a large\nposition.\n\nAfter we bought about 7 million shares, the price began to\nclimb. In frustration, I stopped buying (a mistake that,\nthankfully, I did not repeat when Coca-Cola stock rose similarly\nduring our purchase program). In an even sillier move, I\nsurrendered to my distaste for holding small positions and sold the\n7 million shares we owned.\n\nI wish I could give you a halfway rational explanation for my\namateurish behavior vis-a-vis Fannie Mae. But there isn't one.\nWhat I\ncan\ngive you is an estimate as of yearend 1991 of the\napproximate gain that Berkshire\ndidn't\nmake because of your\nChairman's mistake: about $1.4 billion.\n",

    "chunk_text": "Fixed-Income Securities\n\nOur $40 million of First Empire State preferred carries a 9%\ncoupon, is non-callable until 1996 and is convertible at $78.91 per\nshare. Normally I would think a purchase of this size too small for\nBerkshire, but I have enormous respect for Bob Wilmers, CEO of\nFirst Empire, and like being his partner on any scale.\n\nOur American Express preferred is not a normal fixed-income\nsecurity. Rather it is a \"Perc,\" which carries a fixed dividend of\n8.85% on our $300 million cost. Absent one exception mentioned\nlater, our preferred must be converted three years after issuance,\ninto a maximum of 12,244,898 shares. If necessary, a downward\nadjustment in the conversion ratio will be made in order to limit\nto $414 million the total value of the common we receive. Though\nthere is thus a ceiling on the value of the common stock that we\nwill receive upon conversion, there is no floor. The terms of the\npreferred, however, include a provision allowing us to extend the\nconversion date by one year if the common stock is below $24.50 on\nthe third anniversary of our purchase.\n\nOverall, our fixed-income investments have treated us well,\nboth over the long term and recently. We have realized large\ncapital gains from these holdings, including about $152 million in\n1991. Additionally, our after-tax yields have considerably exceeded\nthose earned by most fixed-income portfolios.\n\nNevertheless, we have had some surprises, none greater than\nthe need for me to involve myself personally and intensely in the\nSalomon situation. As I write this letter, I am also writing a\nletter for inclusion in Salomon's annual report and I refer you to\nthat report for an update on the company. (Write to: Corporate\nSecretary, Salomon Inc, Seven World Trade Center, New York, NY\n10048) Despite the company's travails, Charlie and I believe our\nSalomon preferred stock increased slightly in value during 1991.\nLower interest rates and a higher price for Salomon's common\nproduced this result.\n\nLast year I told you that our USAir investment \"should work\nout all right unless the industry is decimated during the next few\nyears.\" Unfortunately 1991 was a decimating period for the\nindustry, as Midway, Pan Am and America West all entered\nbankruptcy. (Stretch the period to 14 months and you can add\nContinental and TWA.)\n\nThe low valuation that we have given USAir in our table\nreflects the risk that the industry will remain unprofitable for\nvirtually all participants in it, a risk that is far from\nnegligible. The risk is heightened by the fact that the courts have\nbeen encouraging bankrupt carriers to continue operating. These\ncarriers can temporarily charge fares that are below the industry's\ncosts because the bankrupts don't incur the capital costs faced by\ntheir solvent brethren and because they can fund their losses - and\nthereby stave off shutdown - by selling off assets. This burn-thefurniture-to-provide-firewood approach to fare-setting by bankrupt\ncarriers contributes to the toppling of previously-marginal\ncarriers, creating a domino effect that is perfectly designed to\nbring the industry to its knees.\n\nSeth Schofield, who became CEO of USAir in 1991, is making\nmajor adjustments in the airline's operations in order to improve\nits chances of being one of the few industry survivors. There is no\ntougher job in corporate America than running an airline: Despite\nthe huge amounts of equity capital that have been injected into it,\nthe industry, in aggregate, has posted a net loss since its birth\nafter Kitty Hawk. Airline managers need brains, guts, and\nexperience - and Seth possesses all three of these attributes.\n",

Contributions\nmade through the program were $6.8 million, and 2,630 charities\nwere recipients.\n\nWe suggest that new shareholders read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages\n48-49. To participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so\nregistered on August 31,1992 will be ineligible for the 1992\nprogram.\n\nIn addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that\nBerkshire distributes, managers of our operating businesses make\ncontributions, including merchandise, averaging about $1.5 million\nannually. These contributions support local charities, such as The\nUnited Way, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our\nbusinesses.\n\nHowever, neither our operating managers nor officers of the\nparent company use Berkshire funds to make contributions to broad\nnational programs or charitable activities of special personal\ninterest to them, except to the extent they do so as shareholders.\nIf your employees, including your CEO, wish to give to their alma\nmaters or other institutions to which they feel a personal\nattachment, we believe they should use their own money, not yours.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThe faithful will notice that, for the first time in some\nyears, Charlie's annual letter to Wesco shareholders is not\nreprinted in this report. Since his letter is relatively barebones\nthis year, Charlie said he saw no point in including it in these\npages; my own recommendation, however, is that you get a copy of\nthe Wesco report.

Chace, Jr., now 88, has decided not to stand for\nelection as a director this year. But the association of the Chace\nfamily with Berkshire will not end: Malcolm III (Kim), Malcolm's\nson, will be nominated to replace him.\n\nIn 1931, Malcolm went to work for Berkshire Fine Spinning\nAssociates, which merged with Hathaway Manufacturing Co. in 1955 to\nform our present company. Two years later, Malcolm became Berkshire\nHathaway's Chairman, a position he held as well in early 1965 when\nhe made it possible for Buffett Partnership, Ltd. to buy a key\nblock of Berkshire stock owned by some of his relatives. This\npurchase gave our partnership effective control of the company.\nMalcolm's immediate family meanwhile kept its Berkshire stock and\nfor the last 27 years has had the second-largest holding in the\ncompany, trailing only the Buffett family. Malcolm has been a joy\nto work with and we are delighted that the long-running\nrelationship between the Chace family and Berkshire is continuing\nto a new generation.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n",

We will\nhave buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8: 30 and 8: 45 for the\nmeeting and return after it ends.\n\nCharlie and I always enjoy the meeting, and we hope you can\nmake it. The quality of our shareholders is reflected in the\nquality of the questions we get: We have never attended an annual\nmeeting anywhere that features such a consistently high level of\nintelligent, owner-related questions.\n\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. With\nthe admission card, we will enclose information about parking\nfacilities located near the Orpheum. If you are driving, come a\nlittle early. Nearby lots fill up quickly and you may have to\nwalk a few blocks.\n\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture\nMart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you from there to\ndowntown hotels or the airport later. I hope that you will allow\nplenty of time to fully explore the attractions of both stores.\nThose of you arriving early can visit the Furniture Mart any day of\nthe week; it is open from 10 a. m. to 5: 30 p. m. on Saturdays and\nfrom noon to 5: 30 p. m. on Sundays. While there, stop at the See's\nCandy Cart and find out for yourself why Americans ate 26 million\npounds of See's products last year.\n\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday, but we will be open\nfor shareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p. m. on Sunday,\nApril 26. Borsheim's will also have a special party the previous\nevening at which shareholders are welcome. (You must, however,\nwrite Mrs. Gladys Kaiser at our office for an invitation.) On\ndisplay that evening will be a 150-year retrospective of the most\nexceptional timepieces made by Patek Philippe, including watches\nonce owned by Queen Victoria, Pope Pius IX, Rudyard Kipling, Madame\nCurie and Albert Einstein. The centerpiece of the exhibition will\nbe a $5 million watch whose design and manufacture required nine\nyears of labor by Patek Philippe craftsmen. Along with the rest of\nthe collection, this watch will be on display at the store on\nSunday - unless Charlie has by then impulsively bought it.\n\nNicholas Kenner nailed me - again - at last year's meeting,\npointing out that I had said in the 1990 annual report that he was\n11 in May 1990, when actually he was 9. So, asked Nicholas rather\ncaustically: \"If you can't get that straight, how do I know the\nnumbers in the back [the financials] are correct?\" I'm still\nsearching for a snappy response. Nicholas will be at this year's\nmeeting - he spurned my offer of a trip to Disney World on that\nday - so join us to watch a continuation of this lop-sided battle\nof wits.\n\nWarren E.
