    "chunk_text": "Opening Performance Summary\n\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1999\nwas $358 million, which increased the per-share book value of both\nour Class A and Class B stock by 0.5%. Over the last 35 years (that\nis, since present management took over) per-share book value has\ngrown from $19 to $37,987, a rate of 24.0% compounded annually.\n*\n\n* All figures used in this report apply\nto Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the company\nhad outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest\nequal to 1/30 th that of the A.\n\nThe numbers on the facing page show\njust how poor our 1999 record was. We had the worst absolute performance\nof my tenure and, compared to the S&P, the worst relative performance\nas well. Relative results are what concern us: Over time, bad relative\nnumbers will produce unsatisfactory absolute results.\n\nEven Inspector Clouseau could find\nlast year's guilty party: your Chairman. My performance reminds\nme of the quarterback whose report card showed four Fs and a D but\nwho nonetheless had an understanding coach. \"Son,\" he drawled, \"I\nthink you're spending too much time on that one subject.\"\n\nMy \"one subject\" is capital allocation,\nand my grade for 1999 most assuredly is a D. What most hurt us during\nthe year was the inferior performance of Berkshire's equity portfolio\n-- and responsibility for that portfolio, leaving aside the small\npiece of it run by Lou Simpson of GEICO, is entirely mine. Several\nof our largest investees badly lagged the market in 1999 because\nthey've had disappointing operating results. We still like these\nbusinesses and are content to have major investments in them. But\ntheir stumbles damaged our performance last year, and it's no sure\nthing that they will quickly regain their stride.\n\nThe fallout from our weak results\nin 1999 was a more-than-commensurate drop in our stock price. In\n1998, to go back a bit, the stock outperformed the business. Last\nyear the business did much better than the stock, a divergence that\nhas continued to the date of this letter. Over time, of course,\nthe performance of the stock\nmust\nroughly match the performance\nof the business.\n\nDespite our poor showing last year,\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I\nexpect that the gain in Berkshire's intrinsic value over the next\ndecade will modestly exceed the gain from owning the S&P. We\ncan't guarantee that, of course. But we are willing to back our\nconviction with our own money. To repeat a fact you've heard before,\nwell over 99% of my net worth resides in Berkshire. Neither my wife\nnor I have ever sold a share of Berkshire and -- unless our checks\nstop clearing -- we have no intention of doing so.\n\nPlease note that I spoke of hoping\nto beat the S&P \"modestly.\" For Berkshire, truly large superiorities\nover that index are a thing of the past. They existed then because\nwe could buy both businesses and stocks at far more attractive prices\nthan we can now, and also because we then had a much smaller capital\nbase, a situation that allowed us to consider a much wider range\nof investment opportunities than are available to us today.\n\nOur optimism about Berkshire's performance\nis also tempered by the expectation -- indeed, in our minds, the\nvirtual certainty -- that the S&P will do far less well in the\nnext decade or two than it has done since 1982. A recent article\nin Fortune expressed my views as to why this is inevitable, and\nI'm enclosing a copy with this report.\n\nOur goal is to run our present businesses\nwell -- a task made easy because of the outstanding managers we\nhave in place -- and to acquire additional businesses having economic\ncharacteristics and managers comparable to those we already own.\nWe made important progress in this respect during 1999 by acquiring\nJordan's Furniture and contracting to buy a major portion of Mid American\nEnergy. We will talk more about these companies later in the report\nbut let me emphasize one point here: We bought both for cash, issuing\nno Berkshire shares. Deals of that kind aren't always possible,\nbut that is the method of acquisition that Charlie and I vastly\nprefer.",

(For an extensive discussion of this, and other investment\nand accounting terms and concepts, please refer to our Owner's Manual\non pages 55 - 62. Intrinsic value is discussed on page 60.)\n\nIn our last four reports, we have\nfurnished you a table that we regard as useful in estimating Berkshire's\nintrinsic value. In the updated version of that table, which follows,\nwe trace two key components of value. The first column lists our\nper-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents\nbut excluding assets held in our financial products operation) and\nthe second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's\noperating businesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments\n(discussed on page 61), but after all interest and corporate expenses.\nThe second column excludes\nall\ndividends, interest and\ncapital gains that we realized from the investments presented in\nthe first column. In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would\nlook if it were split into two parts, with one entity holding our\ninvestments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing\nall corporate costs.\n\nPre-tax Earnings\n\n(Loss) Per Share\n\nInvestments\n\nWith All Income from\n\nYear\n\nPer Share\n\nInvestments Excluded\n\n...........................................................................\n\n$ 45\n\n$ 4.39\n\n...........................................................................\n\n13.07\n\n...........................................................................\n\n7,200\n\n108.86\n\n...........................................................................\n\n47,339\n\n(458.55)\n\nHere are the growth\nrates of the two segments by decade:\n\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\n\nInvestments\n\nWith All Income from\n\nDecade Ending\n\nPer Share\n\nInvestments Excluded\n\n.............................................\n\n29.0%\n\n11.5%\n\n.............................................\n\n28.7%\n\n23.6%\n\n.............................................\n\n20.7%\n\nN. A.\n\nAnnual Growth Rate, 1969-1999 .................\n\n25.4%\n\nN. A.\n\nIn 1999, our per-share investments\nchanged very little, but our operating earnings, affected by negatives\nthat overwhelmed some strong positives, fell apart. Most of our\noperating managers deserve a grade of A for delivering fine results\nand for having widened the difference between the intrinsic value\nof their businesses and the value at which these are carried on\nour balance sheet. But, offsetting this, we had a huge -- and, I\nbelieve, aberrational -- underwriting loss at General Re. Additionally,\nGEICO's underwriting profit fell, as we had predicted it would.\nGEICO's overall performance, though, was terrific, outstripping\nmy ambitious goals.\n\nWe do not expect our underwriting\nearnings to improve in any dramatic way this year. Though GEICO's\nintrinsic value should grow by a highly satisfying amount, its underwriting\nperformance is almost certain to weaken. That's because auto insurers,\nas a group, will do worse in 2000, and because we will materially\nincrease our marketing expenditures. At General Re, we are raising\nrates and, if there is no mega-catastrophe in 2000, the company's\nunderwriting loss should fall considerably. It takes some time,\nhowever, for the full effect of rate increases to kick in, and General\nRe is therefore likely to have another unsatisfactory underwriting\nyear.\n\nYou should be aware that one item\nregularly working to widen the amount by which intrinsic value exceeds\nbook value is the annual charge against income we take for amortization\nof goodwill -- an amount now running about $500 million. This charge\nreduces the amount of goodwill we show as an asset and likewise\nthe amount that is included in our book value. This is an accounting\nmatter having nothing to do with true economic goodwill, which increases\nin most years. But even if economic goodwill were to remain constant,\nthe annual amortization charge would persistently widen the gap\nbetween intrinsic value and book value.\n\nThough we can't give you a precise\nfigure for Berkshire's intrinsic value, or even an approximation,\nCharlie and I can assure you that it far exceeds our $57.8 billion\nbook value. Businesses such as See's and Buffalo News are now worth\nfifteen to twenty times the value at which they are carried on our\nbooks. Our goal is to continually widen this spread at all subsidiaries.",

As one example, a very high percentage\nof these men and women are independently wealthy, having made fortunes\nin the businesses that they run. They work neither because they\nneed the money nor because they are contractually obligated to --\nwe have no contracts at Berkshire. Rather, they work long and hard\nbecause they love their businesses. And I use the word \"their\" advisedly,\nsince these managers are truly in charge -- there are no show-and-tell\npresentations in Omaha, no budgets to be approved by headquarters,\nno dictums issued about capital expenditures. We simply ask our\nmanagers to run their companies as if these are the sole asset of\ntheir families and will remain so for the next century.\n\nCharlie and I try to behave with\nour managers just as we attempt to behave with Berkshire's shareholders,\ntreating both groups as we would wish to be treated if our positions\nwere reversed. Though \"working\" means nothing to me financially,\nI love doing it at Berkshire for some simple reasons: It gives me\na sense of achievement, a freedom to act as I see fit and an opportunity\nto interact daily with people I like and trust. Why should our managers\n-- accomplished artists at what they do -- see things differently?\n\nIn their relations with Berkshire,\nour managers often appear to be hewing to President Kennedy's charge,\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for\nyour country.\" Here's a remarkable story from last year: It's about\nR. C. Willey, Utah's dominant home furnishing business, which Berkshire\npurchased from Bill Child and his family in 1995. Bill and most\nof his managers are Mormons, and for this reason R. C. Willey's\nstores have never operated on Sunday. This is a difficult way to\ndo business: Sunday is the favorite shopping day for many customers.\nBill, nonetheless, stuck to his principles -- and while doing so\nbuilt his business from $250,000 of annual sales in 1954, when he\ntook over, to $342 million in 1999.\n\nBill felt that R. C. Willey could\noperate successfully in markets outside of Utah and in 1997 suggested\nthat we open a store in Boise. I was highly skeptical about taking\na no-Sunday policy into a new territory where we would be up against\nentrenched rivals open seven days a week. Nevertheless, this was\nBill's business to run. So, despite my reservations, I told him\nto follow both his business judgment and his religious convictions.\n\nBill then insisted on a truly extraordinary\nproposition: He would personally buy the land and build the store\n-- for about $9 million as it turned out -- and would sell it to\nus at his cost if it proved to be successful. On the other hand,\nif sales fell short of his expectations, we could exit the business\nwithout paying Bill a cent. This outcome, of course, would leave\nhim with a huge investment in an empty building. I told him that\nI appreciated his offer but felt that if Berkshire was going to\nget the upside it should also take the downside. Bill said nothing\ndoing: If there was to be failure because of his religious beliefs,\nhe wanted to take the blow personally.\n\nThe store opened last August and\nimmediately became a huge success. Bill thereupon turned the property\nover to us -- including some extra land that had appreciated significantly\n-- and we wrote him a check for his cost. And get this:\nBill\nrefused to take a dime of interest on the capital he had tied up\nover the two years\n.\n\nIf a manager has behaved similarly\nat some other public corporation, I haven't heard about it. You\ncan understand why the opportunity to partner with people like Bill\nChild causes me to tap dance to work every morning.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nA footnote: After our \"soft\" opening\nin August, we had a grand opening of the Boise store about a month\nlater. Naturally, I went there to cut the ribbon (your Chairman,\nI wish to emphasize, is good for\nsomething\n). In my talk\nI told the crowd how sales had far exceeded expectations, making\nus, by a considerable margin, the largest home furnishings store\nin Idaho. Then, as the speech progressed, my memory miraculously\nbegan to improve. By the end of my talk, it all had come back to\nme: Opening a store in Boise had been\nmy\nidea.",

    "chunk_text": "The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\n\nOur main business -- though\nwe have others of great importance -- is insurance. To understand\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to\nevaluate an insurance company. The key determinants are: (1) the\namount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3)\nmost critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.\n\nTo begin with, float is money we\nhold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because\npremiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes\nextends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the\nmoney. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:\nThe premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses\nand expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an \"underwriting\nloss,\" which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value\nif its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company\nwould otherwise incur to obtain funds. But the business is a lemon\nif its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.\n\nA caution is appropriate here: Because\nloss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in\nfiguring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult\nfor investors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Errors\nof estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.\nThe consequences of these miscalculations flow directly into earnings.\nAn experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in\nreserving, but the general public can typically do no more than\naccept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the\nnumbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed. In 1999\na number of insurers announced reserve adjustments that made a mockery\nof the \"earnings\" that investors had relied on earlier when making\ntheir buy and sell decisions. At Berkshire, we strive to be conservative\nand consistent in our reserving. Even so, we warn you that an unpleasant\nsurprise is always possible.\n\nThe table that follows shows (at\nintervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire's\ninsurance operations since we entered the business 33 years ago\nupon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional lines\nare included in the segment \"Other Primary\"). For the table we have\ncalculated our float -- which we generate in large amounts relative\nto our premium volume -- by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment\nreserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium\nreserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition\ncosts, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed\nreinsurance. (Got that?)\n\nYearend\nFloat (in $ millions)\n\nYear\n\nGEICO\n\nGeneral Re\n\nOther\n\nReinsurance\n\nOther\n\nPrimary\n\nTotal\n\n1,508\n\n2,917\n\n4,014\n\n7,386\n\n3,125\n\n14,909\n\n4,305\n\n22,754\n\n3,444\n\n15,166\n\n6,285\n\n25,298\n\nGrowth of float is important -- but\nits cost is what's vital. Over the years we have usually recorded\nonly a small underwriting loss -- which means our cost of float\nwas correspondingly low -- or actually had an underwriting profit,\nwhich means we were being\npaid\nfor holding other people's\nmoney. Indeed, our cumulative result through 1998 was an underwriting\nprofit. In 1999, however, we incurred a $1.4 billion underwriting\nloss that left us with float cost of 5.8%. One mildly mitigating\nfactor: We enthusiastically welcomed $400 million of the loss because\nit stems from business that will deliver us exceptional float over\nthe next decade. The balance of the loss, however, was decidedly\nunwelcome, and our overall result must be judged extremely poor.\nAbsent a mega-catastrophe, we expect float cost to fall in 2000,\nbut any decline will be tempered by our aggressive plans for GEICO,\nwhich we will discuss later.\n\nThere are a number of people\nwho deserve credit for manufacturing so much \"no-cost\" float over\nthe years. Foremost is Ajit Jain. It's simply impossible to overstate\nAjit's value to Berkshire: He has from scratch built an outstanding\nreinsurance business, which during his tenure has earned an underwriting\nprofit and now holds $6.3 billion of float.\n\nIn Ajit, we have an underwriter\nequipped with the intelligence to properly rate most risks; the\nrealism to forget about those he can't evaluate; the courage to\nwrite huge policies when the premium is appropriate; and the discipline\nto reject even the smallest risk when the premium is inadequate.\nIt is rare to find a person possessing any one of these talents.\nFor one person to have them all is remarkable.\n\nSince Ajit specializes in super-cat\nreinsurance, a line in which losses are infrequent but extremely\nlarge when they occur, his business is sure to be far more volatile\nthan most insurance operations. To date, we have benefitted from\ngood luck on this volatile book. Even so, Ajit's achievements are\ntruly extraordinary.\n\nIn a smaller but nevertheless important\nway, our \"other primary\" insurance operation has also added to Berkshire's\nintrinsic value. This collection of insurers has delivered a $192\nmillion underwriting profit over the past five years while supplying\nus with the float shown in the table. In the insurance world, results\nlike this are uncommon, and for their feat we thank Rod Eldred,\nBrad Kinstler, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the\nGeneral Re operation had an exceptionally poor underwriting year\nin 1999 (though investment income left the company well in the black).\nOur business was extremely underpriced, both domestically and internationally,\na condition that is improving but not yet corrected. Over time,\nhowever, the company should develop a growing amount of low-cost\nfloat. At both General Re and its Cologne subsidiary, incentive\ncompensation plans are now directly tied to the variables of float\ngrowth and cost of float, the same variables that determine value\nfor owners.\n\nEven though a reinsurer may\nhave a tightly focused and rational compensation system, it cannot\ncount on every year coming up roses. Reinsurance is a highly volatile\nbusiness, and neither General Re nor Ajit's operation is immune\nto bad pricing behavior in the industry. But General Re has the\ndistribution, the underwriting skills, the culture, and -- with\nBerkshire's backing -- the financial clout to become the world's\nmost profitable reinsurance company. Getting there will take time,\nenergy and discipline, but we have no doubt that Ron Ferguson and\nhis crew can make it happen.",
    "contextual_summary": "Our main business -- though we have others of great importance -- is insurance. To understand Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company. The key determinants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.",

    "chunk_text": "GEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO. com)\n\nGEICO made exceptional progress\nin 1999. The reasons are simple: We have a terrific business idea\nbeing implemented by an extraordinary manager, Tony Nicely. When\nBerkshire purchased GEICO at the beginning of 1996, we handed the\nkeys to Tony and asked him to run the operation exactly as if he\nowned 100% of it. He has done the rest. Take a look at his scorecard:\n\nNew Auto\n\nAuto Policies\n\nYears\n\nPolicies\n(1)(2)\n\nIn-Force\n(1)\n\n346,882\n\n2,011,055\n\n384,217\n\n2,147,549\n\n443,539\n\n2,310,037\n\n592,300\n\n2,543,699\n\n868,430\n\n2,949,439\n\n1,249,875\n\n3,562,644\n\n1,648,095\n\n4,328,900\n\n(1)\n\"Voluntary\" only; excludes assigned risks and the like.\n\n(2)\nRevised to exclude policies moved from one GEICO company\nto another.\n\nIn 1995, GEICO spent $33 million\non marketing and had 652 telephone counselors. Last year the company\nspent $242 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,631. And we\nare just starting: The pace will step up materially in 2000. Indeed,\nwe would happily commit $1 billion annually to marketing if we knew\nwe could handle the business smoothly and if we expected the last\ndollar spent to produce new business at an attractive cost.\n\nCurrently two trends are affecting\nacquisition costs. The bad news is that it has become more expensive\nto develop inquiries. Media rates have risen, and we are also seeing\ndiminishing returns -- that is, as both we and our competitors step\nup advertising, inquiries per ad fall for all of us. These negatives\nare partly offset, however, by the fact that our closure ratio --\nthe percentage of inquiries converted to sales -- has steadily improved.\nOverall, we believe that our cost of new business, though definitely\nrising, is well below that of the industry. Of even greater importance,\nour operating costs for renewal business are the lowest among broad-based\nnational auto insurers. Both of these major competitive advantages\nare sustainable. Others may copy our model, but\nthey will be unable to replicate our economics.\n\nThe table above makes it appear\nthat GEICO's retention of policyholders is falling, but for two\nreasons appearances are in this case deceiving. First, in the last\nfew years our business mix has moved away from \"preferred\" policyholders,\nfor whom industrywide retention rates are high, toward \"standard\"\nand \"non-standard\" policyholders for whom retention rates are much\nlower. (Despite the nomenclature, the three classes have similar\nprofit prospects.) Second, retention rates for relatively new policyholders\nare always lower than those for long-time customers -- and because\nof our accelerated growth, our policyholder ranks now include an\nincreased proportion of new customers. Adjusted for these two factors,\nour retention rate has changed hardly at all.\n\nWe told you last year that underwriting\nmargins for both GEICO and the industry would fall in 1999, and\nthey did. We make a similar prediction for 2000. A few years ago\nmargins got too wide, having enjoyed the effects of an unusual and\nunexpected decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents.\nThe industry responded by reducing rates -- but now is having to\ncontend with an increase in loss costs. We would not be surprised\nto see the margins of auto insurers deteriorate by around three\npercentage points in 2000.\n\nTwo negatives besides worsening\nfrequency and severity will hurt the industry this year. First,\nrate increases go into effect only slowly, both because of regulatory\ndelay and because insurance contracts must run their course before\nnew rates can be put in. Second, reported earnings of many auto\ninsurers have benefitted in the last few years from reserve releases,\nmade possible because the companies overestimated their loss costs\nin still-earlier years. This reservoir of redundant reserves has\nnow largely dried up, and future boosts to earnings from this source\nwill be minor at best.\n\nIn compensating its associates --\nfrom Tony on down -- GEICO continues to use two variables, and only\ntwo, in determining what bonuses and profit-sharing contributions\nwill be: 1) its percentage growth in policyholders and 2) the earnings\nof its \"seasoned\" business, meaning policies that have been with\nus for more than a year. We did outstandingly well on both fronts\nduring 1999 and therefore made a profit-sharing payment of 28.4%\nof salary (in total, $113.3 million) to the great majority of our\nassociates. Tony and I love writing those checks.\n\nAt Berkshire, we want to have compensation\npolicies that are both easy to understand and in sync with what\nwe wish our associates to accomplish. Writing new business is expensive\n(and, as mentioned, getting more expensive). If we were to include\nthose costs in our calculation of bonuses -- as managements did\nbefore our arrival at GEICO -- we would be penalizing our associates\nfor garnering new policies, even though these are very much in Berkshire's\ninterest. So, in effect, we say to our associates that we will foot\nthe bill for new business. Indeed, because percentage growth in\npolicyholders is part of our compensation scheme, we\nreward\n\nour associates for producing this initially-unprofitable business.\nAnd then we reward them additionally for holding down costs on our\nseasoned business.\n\nDespite the extensive advertising\nwe do, our best source of new business is word-of-mouth recommendations\nfrom existing policyholders, who on the whole are pleased with our\nprices and service. An article published last year by\nKiplinger's\nPersonal Finance\n\nMagazine\ngives a good picture of\nwhere we stand in customer satisfaction: The magazine's survey of\n20 state insurance departments showed that GEICO's complaint ratio\nwas well below the ratio for most of its major competitors.\n\nOur strong referral business means\nthat we probably could maintain our policy count by spending as\nlittle as $50 million annually on advertising. That's a guess, of\ncourse, and we will never know whether it is accurate because Tony's\nfoot is going to stay on the advertising pedal (and my foot will\nbe on his). Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that a major percentage\nof the $300-$350 million we will spend in 2000 on advertising, as\nwell as large additional costs we will incur for sales counselors,\ncommunications and facilities, are optional outlays we choose to\nmake so that we can both achieve significant growth and extend and\nsolidify the promise of the GEICO brand in the minds of Americans.\n\nPersonally, I think these expenditures\nare the best investment Berkshire can make. Through its advertising,\nGEICO is acquiring a direct relationship with a huge number of households\nthat, on average, will send us $1,100 year after year. That makes\nus -- among all companies, selling whatever kind of product -- one\nof the country's leading direct merchandisers. Also, as we build\nour long-term relationships with more and more families, cash is\npouring in rather than going out (no Internet economics here). Last\nyear, as GEICO increased its customer base by 766,256, it gained\n$590 million of cash from operating earnings and the increase in\nfloat.",

EJA, which sells\nand manages the fractional ownership of jet aircraft, through its\nNet Jets® program, is larger than its next two competitors combined.\nFSI trains pilots (as well as other transportation professionals)\nand is five times or so the size of its nearest competitor.\n\nAnother common characteristic of\nthe companies is that they are still managed by their founding entrepreneurs.\nAl Ueltschi started FSI in 1951 with $10,000, and Rich Santulli\ninvented the fractional-ownership industry in 1986. These men are\nboth remarkable managers who have no financial need to work but\nthrive on helping their companies grow and excel.\n\nThough these two businesses have\nleadership positions that are similar, they differ in their economic\ncharacteristics. FSI must lay out huge amounts of capital. A single\nflight simulator can cost as much as $15 million -- and we have\n222. Only one person at a time, furthermore, can be trained in a\nsimulator, which means that the capital investment per dollar of\nrevenue at FSI is exceptionally high. Operating margins must therefore\nalso be high, if we are to earn a reasonable return on capital.\nLast year we made capital expenditures of $215 million at FSI and\nFlight Safety Boeing, its 50%-owned affiliate.\n\nAt EJA, in contrast, the customer\nowns the equipment, though we, of course, must invest in a core\nfleet of our own planes to ensure outstanding service. For example,\nthe Sunday after Thanksgiving, EJA's busiest day of the year, strains\nour resources since fractions of 169 planes are owned by 1,412 customers,\nmany of whom are bent on flying home between 3 and 6 p. m. On that\nday, and certain others, we need a supply of company-owned aircraft\nto make sure all parties get where they want, when they want.\n\nStill, most of the planes\nwe fly are owned by customers, which means that modest pre-tax margins\nin this business can produce good returns on equity. Currently,\nour customers own planes worth over $2 billion, and in addition\nwe have $4.2 billion of planes on order. Indeed, the limiting factor\nin our business right now is the availability of planes. We now\nare taking delivery of about 8% of all business jets manufactured\nin the world, and we wish we could get a bigger share than that.\nThough EJA was supply-constrained in 1999, its recurring revenues\n-- monthly management fees plus hourly flight fees -- increased\n46%.\n\nThe fractional-ownership industry\nis still in its infancy. EJA is now building critical mass in Europe,\nand over time we will expand around the world. Doing that will be\nexpensive -- very expensive -- but we will spend what it takes.\nScale is vital to both us and our customers: The company with the\nmost planes in the air worldwide will be able to offer its customers\nthe best service. \"Buy a fraction, get a fleet\" has real meaning\nat EJA.\n\nEJA enjoys another important advantage\nin that its two largest competitors are both subsidiaries of aircraft\nmanufacturers and sell only the aircraft their parents make. Though\nthese are fine planes, these competitors are severely limited in\nthe cabin styles and mission capabilities they can offer. EJA, in\ncontrast, offers a wide array of planes from five suppliers. Consequently,\nwe can give the customer whatever\nhe\nneeds to buy -- rather\nthan his getting what the competitor's parent needs to sell.\n\nLast year in this report, I described\nmy family's delight with the one-quarter (200 flight hours annually)\nof a Hawker 1000 that we had owned since 1995. I got so pumped up\nby my own prose that shortly thereafter I signed up for one-sixteenth\nof a Cessna V Ultra as well. Now my annual outlays at EJA and Borsheim's,\ncombined, total ten times my salary. Think of this as a rough guideline\nfor your own expenditures with us.\n\nDuring the past year, two of Berkshire's\noutside directors have also signed on with EJA. (Maybe we're paying\nthem too much.) You should be aware that they and I are charged\nexactly the same price for planes and service as is any other customer:\nEJA follows a \"most favored nations\" policy, with no one getting\na special deal.\n\nAnd now, brace yourself. Last year,\nEJA passed the ultimate test:\nCharlie signed up.\nNo other\nendorsement could speak more eloquently to the value of the EJA\nservice. Give us a call at 1-800-848-6436 and ask for our \"white\npaper\" on fractional ownership.",

    "chunk_text": "Acquisitions of 1999\n\nAt both GEICO and Executive Jet,\nour best source of new customers is the happy ones we already have.\nIndeed, about 65% of our new owners of aircraft come as referrals\nfrom current owners who have fallen in love with the service.\n\nOur acquisitions usually develop\nin the same way. At other companies, executives may devote themselves\nto pursuing acquisition possibilities with investment bankers, utilizing\nan auction process that has become standardized. In this exercise\nthe bankers prepare a \"book\" that makes me think of the Superman\ncomics of my youth. In the Wall Street version, a formerly mild-mannered\ncompany emerges from the investment banker's phone booth able to\nleap over competitors in a single bound and with earnings moving\nfaster than a speeding bullet. Titillated by the book's description\nof the acquiree's powers, acquisition-hungry CEOs -- Lois Lanes\nall, beneath their cool exteriors -- promptly swoon.\n\nWhat's particularly entertaining\nin these books is the precision with which earnings are projected\nfor many years ahead. If you ask the author-banker, however, what\nhis own firm will earn\nnext month\n, he will go into a protective\ncrouch and tell you that business and markets are far too uncertain\nfor him to venture a forecast.\n\nHere's one story I can't resist\nrelating: In 1985, a major investment banking house undertook to\nsell Scott Fetzer, offering it widely -- but with no success. Upon\nreading of this strikeout, I wrote Ralph Schey, then and now Scott\nFetzer's CEO, expressing an interest in buying the business. I had\nnever met Ralph, but within a week we had a deal. Unfortunately,\nScott Fetzer's letter of engagement with the banking firm provided\nit a $2.5 million fee upon sale, even if it had nothing to do with\nfinding the buyer. I guess the lead banker felt he should do something\nfor his payment, so he graciously offered us a copy of the book\non Scott Fetzer that his firm had prepared. With his customary tact,\nCharlie responded: \"I'll pay $2.5 million\nnot\nto read it.\"\n\nAt Berkshire, our carefully-crafted\nacquisition strategy is simply to wait for the phone to ring. Happily,\nit sometimes does so, usually because a manager who sold to us earlier\nhas recommended to a friend that he think about following suit.\n\nWhich brings us to the furniture\nbusiness. Two years ago I recounted how the acquisition of Nebraska\nFurniture Mart in 1983 and my subsequent association with the Blumkin\nfamily led to follow-on transactions with R. C. Willey (1995) and\nStar Furniture (1997). For me, these relationships have all been\nterrific. Not only did Berkshire acquire three outstanding retailers;\nthese deals also allowed me to become friends with some of the finest\npeople you will ever meet.\n\nNaturally, I have persistently asked\nthe Blumkins, Bill Child and Melvyn Wolff whether there are any\nmore out there like you. Their invariable answer was the Tatelman\nbrothers of New England and their remarkable furniture business,\nJordan's.\n\nI met Barry and Eliot Tatelman last\nyear and we soon signed an agreement for Berkshire to acquire the\ncompany. Like our three previous furniture acquisitions, this business\nhad long been in the family -- in this case since 1927, when Barry\nand Eliot's grandfather began operations in a Boston suburb. Under\nthe brothers' management, Jordan's has grown ever more dominant\nin its region, becoming the largest furniture retailer in New Hampshire\nas well as Massachusetts.\n\nThe Tatelmans don't just sell furniture\nor manage stores. They also present customers with a dazzling entertainment\nexperience called \"shoppertainment.\" A family visiting a store can\nhave a terrific time, while concurrently viewing an extraordinary\nselection of merchandise. The business results are also extraordinary:\nJordan's has the highest sales per square foot of any major furniture\noperation in the country. I urge you to visit one of their stores\nif you are in the Boston area -- particularly the one at Natick,\nwhich is Jordan's newest. Bring money.\n\nBarry and Eliot are classy people\n-- just like their counterparts at Berkshire's three other furniture\noperations. When they sold to us, they elected to give each of their\nemployees at least 50¢ for every hour that he or she had worked for\nJordan's. This payment added up to $9 million, which came from the\nTatelmans' own pockets, not from Berkshire's. And Barry and Eliot\nwere thrilled to write the checks.\n\nEach of our furniture operations\nis number one in its territory. We now sell more furniture than\nanyone else in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Texas, Nebraska, Utah\nand Idaho. Last year Star's Melvyn Wolff and his sister, Shirley\nToomim, scored two major successes: a move into San Antonio and\na significant enlargement of Star's store in Austin.\n\nThere's no operation in the furniture\nretailing business remotely like the one assembled by Berkshire.\nIt's fun for me and profitable for you. W. C. Fields once said,\n\"It was a woman who drove me to drink, but unfortunately I never\nhad the chance to thank her.\" I don't want to make that mistake.\nMy thanks go to Louie, Ron and Irv Blumkin for getting me started\nin the furniture business and for unerringly guiding me as we have\nassembled the group we now have.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nNow, for our second acquisition\ndeal: It came to us through my good friend, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman\nof Level 3 Communications and a director of Berkshire. Walter has\nmany other business connections as well, and one of them is with\nMid American Energy, a utility company in which he has substantial\nholdings and on whose board he sits. At a conference in California\nthat we both attended last September, Walter casually asked me whether\nBerkshire might be interested in making a large investment in Mid American,\nand from the start the idea of being in partnership with Walter\nstruck me as a good one. Upon returning to Omaha, I read some of\nMid American's public reports and had two short meetings with Walter\nand David Sokol, Mid American's talented and entrepreneurial CEO.\nI then said that, at an appropriate price, we would indeed like\nto make a deal.\n\nAcquisitions in the electric utility\nindustry are complicated by a variety of regulations including the\nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Therefore, we had to\nstructure a transaction that would avoid Berkshire gaining voting\ncontrol. Instead we are purchasing an 11% fixed-income security,\nalong with a combination of common stock and exchangeable preferred\nthat will give Berkshire just under 10% of the voting power of Mid American\nbut about 76% of the equity interest. All told, our investment will\nbe about $2 billion.\n\nWalter characteristically backed\nup his convictions with real money: He and his family will buy more\nMid American stock for cash when the transaction closes, bringing\ntheir total investment to about $280 million. Walter will also be\nthe controlling shareholder of the company, and I can't think of\na better person to hold that post.\n\nThough there are many regulatory\nconstraints in the utility industry, it's possible that we will\nmake additional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts\ninvolved could be large.",

    "chunk_text": "Acquisition Accounting\n\nOnce again, I would like to make\nsome comments about accounting, in this case about its application\nto acquisitions. This is currently a very contentious topic and,\nbefore the dust settles, Congress may even intervene (a truly terrible\nidea).\n\nWhen a company is acquired, generally\naccepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") currently condone two very\ndifferent ways of recording the transaction: \"purchase\" and \"pooling.\"\nIn a pooling, stock must be the currency; in a purchase, payment\ncan be made in either cash or stock. Whatever the currency, managements\nusually detest purchase accounting because it almost always requires\nthat a \"goodwill\" account be established and subsequently written\noff -- a process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge\nthat normally persists for decades. In contrast, pooling avoids\na goodwill account, which is why managements love it.\n\nNow, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (\"FASB\") has proposed an end to pooling, and many CEOs are\ngirding for battle. It will be an important fight, so we'll venture\nsome opinions. To begin with, we agree with the many managers who\nargue that goodwill amortization charges are usually spurious. You'll\nfind my thinking about this in the appendix to our 1983 annual report,\nwhich is available on our website, and in the Owner's Manual on\npages 55 - 62.\n\nFor accounting rules to mandate\namortization that will, in the usual case, conflict with reality\nis deeply troublesome: Most accounting charges\nrelate\nto\nwhat's going on, even if they don't precisely measure it. As an\nexample, depreciation charges can't with precision calibrate the\ndecline in value that physical assets suffer, but these charges\ndo at least describe something that is truly occurring: Physical\nassets invariably deteriorate. Correspondingly, obsolescence charges\nfor inventories, bad debt charges for receivables and accruals for\nwarranties are among the charges that reflect true costs. The annual\ncharges for these expenses can't be exactly measured, but the necessity\nfor estimating them is obvious.\n\nIn contrast, economic goodwill does\nnot, in many cases, diminish. Indeed, in a great many instances\n-- perhaps most -- it actually grows in value over time. In character,\neconomic goodwill is much like land: The value of both assets is\nsure to fluctuate, but the direction in which value is going to\ngo is in no way ordained. At See's, for example, economic goodwill\nhas grown, in an irregular but very substantial manner, for 78 years.\nAnd, if we run the business right, growth of that kind will probably\ncontinue for at least another 78 years.\n\nTo escape from the fiction of goodwill\ncharges, managers embrace the fiction of pooling. This accounting\nconvention is grounded in the poetic notion that when two rivers\nmerge their streams become indistinguishable. Under this concept,\na company that has been merged into a larger enterprise has not\nbeen \"purchased\" (even though it will often have received a large\n\"sell-out\" premium). Consequently, no goodwill is created, and those\npesky subsequent charges to earnings are eliminated. Instead, the\naccounting for the ongoing entity is handled as if the businesses\nhad forever been one unit.\n\nSo much for poetry. The reality\nof merging is usually far different: There is indisputably an acquirer\nand an acquiree, and the latter has been \"purchased,\" no matter\nhow the deal has been structured. If you think otherwise, just ask\nemployees severed from their jobs which company was the conqueror\nand which was the conquered. You will find no confusion. So on this\npoint the FASB is correct: In most mergers, a purchase has been\nmade. Yes, there are some true \"mergers of equals,\" but they are\nfew and far between.\n\nCharlie and I believe there's a\nreality-based approach that should both satisfy the FASB, which\ncorrectly wishes to record a purchase, and meet the objections of\nmanagements to nonsensical charges for diminution of goodwill. We\nwould first have the acquiring company record its purchase price\n-- whether paid in stock or cash -- at fair value. In most cases,\nthis procedure would create a large asset representing economic\ngoodwill. We would then leave this asset on the books, not requiring\nits amortization. Later, if the economic goodwill became impaired,\nas it sometimes would, it would be written down just as would any\nother asset judged to be impaired.\n\nIf our proposed rule were to be\nadopted, it should be applied retroactively so that acquisition\naccounting would be consistent throughout America -- a far cry from\nwhat exists today. One prediction: If this plan were to take effect,\nmanagements would structure acquisitions more sensibly, deciding\nwhether to use cash or stock based on the real consequences for\ntheir shareholders rather than on the unreal consequences for their\nreported earnings.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nIn our purchase of Jordan's, we\nfollowed a procedure that will maximize the cash produced for our\nshareholders but minimize the earnings we report to you. Berkshire\npurchased assets for cash, an approach that on our tax returns permits\nus to amortize the resulting goodwill over a 15-year period. Obviously,\nthis tax deduction materially increases the amount of cash delivered\nby the business. In contrast, when stock, rather than assets, is\npurchased for cash, the resulting writeoffs of goodwill are not\ntax-deductible. The economic difference between these two approaches\nis substantial.\n\nFrom the economic standpoint of\nthe acquiring company, the worst deal of all is a stock-for-stock\nacquisition. Here, a huge price is often paid without there being\nany step-up in the tax basis of either the stock of the acquiree\nor its assets. If the acquired entity is subsequently sold, its\nowner may owe a large capital gains tax (at a 35% or greater rate),\neven though the sale may truly be producing a major economic loss.\n\nWe have made some deals at Berkshire\nthat used far-from-optimal tax structures. These deals occurred\nbecause the sellers insisted on a given structure and because, overall,\nwe still felt the acquisition made sense. We have never done an\ninefficiently-structured deal, however, in order to make our figures\nlook better.",

But we manufacture shoes primarily in the U. S.,\nand it has become extremely difficult for domestic producers to\ncompete effectively. In 1999, approximately 93% of the 1.3 billion\npairs of shoes purchased in this country came from abroad, where\nextremely low-cost labor is the rule.\n\nCounting both Dexter and H. H. Brown,\nwe are currently the leading domestic manufacturer of shoes, and\nwe are likely to continue to be. We have loyal, highly-skilled workers\nin our U. S. plants, and we want to retain every job here that we\ncan. Nevertheless, in order to remain viable, we are sourcing more\nof our output internationally. In doing that, we have incurred significant\nseverance and relocation costs that are included in the earnings\nwe show in the table.\n\nA few years back, Helzberg's, our\n200-store jewelry operation, needed to make operating adjustments\nto restore margins to appropriate levels. Under Jeff Comment's leadership,\nthe job was done and profits have dramatically rebounded. In the\nshoe business, where we have Harold Alfond, Peter Lunder, Frank\nRooney and Jim Issler in charge, I believe we will see a similar\nimprovement over the next few years.\n\nSee's Candies deserves a special\ncomment, given that it achieved a record operating margin of 24%\nlast year. Since we bought See's for $25 million in 1972, it has\nearned $857 million pre-tax. And, despite its growth, the business\nhas required very little additional capital. Give the credit for\nthis performance to Chuck Huggins. Charlie and I put him in charge\nthe day of our purchase, and his fanatical insistence on both product\nquality and friendly service has rewarded customers, employees and\nowners.\n\nChuck gets better every year. When\nhe took charge of See's at age 46, the company's pre-tax profit,\nexpressed in millions, was about 10% of his age. Today he's 74,\nand the ratio has increased to 100%. Having discovered this mathematical\nrelationship -- let's call it Huggins' Law -- Charlie and I now\nbecome giddy at the mere thought of Chuck's birthday.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAdditional information about our\nvarious businesses is given on pages 39 - 54, where you will also\nfind our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. In addition,\non pages 63 - 69, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data\ninto four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds\nto the way Charlie and I think about the company.",

The reason for our thinking is simple: Our\ninvestees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high\nrates of return. So why should we want them paid out?\n\nTo depict something closer to economic\nreality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the\nconcept of \"look-through\" earnings. As we calculate these, they\nconsist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\nsection, plus; (2) our share of the retained operating earnings\nof major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected\nin our profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be\npaid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead\nbeen distributed to us. When tabulating \"operating earnings\" here,\nwe exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well as capital gains\nand other major non-recurring items.\n\nThe following table sets forth our\n1999 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can\nbe no more than approximate, since they are based on a number of\njudgment calls.

As I mentioned earlier, several of the companies in which\nwe have large investments had disappointing business results last\nyear. Nevertheless, we believe these companies have important competitive\nadvantages that will endure over time. This attribute, which makes\nfor good long-term investment results, is one Charlie and I occasionally\nbelieve we can identify. More often, however, we can't -- not at\nleast with a high degree of conviction. This explains, by the way,\nwhy we don't own stocks of tech companies, even though we share\nthe general view that our society will be transformed by their products\nand services. Our problem -- which we can't solve by studying up\n-- is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech\nfield possess a truly\ndurable\ncompetitive advantage.\n\nOur lack of tech insights, we should\nadd, does not distress us. After all, there are a great many business\nareas in which Charlie and I have no special capital-allocation\nexpertise. For instance, we bring nothing to the table when it comes\nto evaluating patents, manufacturing processes or geological prospects.\nSo we simply don't get into judgments in those fields.\n\nIf we have a strength, it is in\nrecognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence\nand when we are approaching the perimeter. Predicting the long-term\neconomics of companies that operate in fast-changing industries\nis simply far beyond our perimeter. If others claim predictive skill\nin those industries -- and seem to have their claims validated by\nthe behavior of the stock market -- we neither envy nor emulate\nthem. Instead, we just stick with what we understand. If we stray,\nwe will have done so inadvertently, not because we got restless\nand substituted hope for rationality. Fortunately, it's almost certain\nthere will be opportunities from time to time for Berkshire to do\nwell within the circle we've staked out.\n\nRight now, the prices of the fine\nbusinesses we already own are just not that attractive. In other\nwords, we feel much better about the businesses than their stocks.\nThat's why we haven't added to our present holdings. Nevertheless,\nwe haven't yet scaled back our portfolio in a major way: If the\nchoice is between a questionable business at a comfortable price\nor a comfortable business at a questionable price, we much prefer\nthe latter. What really gets our attention, however, is a comfortable\nbusiness at a comfortable price.\n\nOur reservations about the prices\nof securities we own apply also to the general level of equity prices.\nWe have never attempted to forecast what the stock market is going\nto do in the next month or the next year, and we are not trying\nto do that now. But, as I point out in the enclosed article, equity\ninvestors currently seem wildly optimistic in their expectations\nabout future returns.\n\nWe see the growth in corporate profits\nas being largely tied to the business done in the country (GDP),\nand we see GDP growing at a real rate of about 3%. In addition,\nwe have hypothesized 2% inflation. Charlie and I have no particular\nconviction about the accuracy of 2%. However, it's the market's\nview: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yield about\ntwo percentage points less than the standard treasury bond, and\nif you believe inflation rates are going to be higher than that,\nyou can profit by simply buying TIPS and shorting Governments.\n\nIf profits do indeed grow along\nwith GDP, at about a 5% rate, the valuation placed on American business\nis unlikely to climb by much more than that. Add in something for\ndividends, and you emerge with returns from equities that are dramatically\nless than most investors have either experienced in the past or\nexpect in the future. If investor expectations become more realistic\n-- and they almost certainly will -- the market adjustment is apt\nto be severe, particularly in sectors in which speculation has been\nconcentrated.\n\nBerkshire will someday have opportunities\nto deploy major amounts of cash in equity markets -- we are confident\nof that. But, as the song goes, \"Who knows where or when?\" Meanwhile,\nif anyone starts explaining to you what is going on in the truly-manic\nportions of this \"enchanted\" market, you might remember still another\nline of song: \"Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.\"",

    "chunk_text": "Share Repurchases\n\nRecently, a number of shareholders\nhave suggested to us that Berkshire repurchase its shares. Usually\nthe requests were rationally based, but a few leaned on spurious\nlogic.\n\nThere is only one combination of\nfacts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares:\nFirst, the company has available funds -- cash plus sensible borrowing\ncapacity -- beyond the near-term needs of the business and, second,\nfinds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value,\nconservatively-calculated. To this we add a caveat: Shareholders\nshould have been supplied all the information they need for estimating\nthat value. Otherwise, insiders could take advantage of their uninformed\npartners and buy out their interests at a fraction of true worth.\nWe have, on rare occasions, seen that happen. Usually, of course,\nchicanery is employed to drive stock prices up, not down.\n\nThe business \"needs\" that I speak\nof are of two kinds: First, expenditures that a company must make\nto maintain its competitive position (e. g., the remodeling of stores\nat Helzberg's) and, second, optional outlays, aimed at business\ngrowth, that management expects will produce more than a dollar\nof value for each dollar spent (R. C. Willey's expansion into Idaho).\n\nWhen available funds exceed needs\nof those kinds, a company with a growth-oriented shareholder population\ncan buy new businesses or repurchase shares. If a company's stock\nis selling well below intrinsic value, repurchases usually make\nthe most sense. In the mid-1970 s, the wisdom of making these was\nvirtually screaming at managements, but few responded. In most cases,\nthose that did made their owners much wealthier than if alternative\ncourses of action had been pursued. Indeed, during the 1970 s (and, spasmodically, for some years\nthereafter) we searched for companies that were large repurchasers of\ntheir shares. This often was a tipoff that the company was both undervalued\nand run by a shareholder-oriented management.\n\nThat day is past. Now, repurchases\nare all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and,\nin our view, ignoble reason: to pump or support the stock price.\nThe shareholder who chooses to sell today, of course, is benefitted\nby any buyer, whatever his origin or motives. But the\ncontinuing\n\nshareholder is penalized by repurchases above intrinsic value. Buying\ndollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick\naround.\n\nCharlie and I admit that we feel\nconfident in estimating intrinsic value for only a portion of traded\nequities and then only when we employ a range of values, rather\nthan some pseudo-precise figure. Nevertheless, it appears to us\nthat many companies now making repurchases are overpaying departing\nshareholders at the expense of those who stay. In defense of those\ncompanies, I would say that it is natural for CEOs to be optimistic\nabout their own businesses. They also know a whole lot more about\nthem than I do. However, I can't help but feel that too often today's\nrepurchases are dictated by management's desire to \"show confidence\"\nor be in fashion rather than by a desire to enhance per-share value.\n\nSometimes, too, companies say they\nare repurchasing shares to offset the shares issued when stock options\ngranted at much lower prices are exercised. This \"buy high, sell\nlow\" strategy is one many unfortunate investors have employed --\nbut never intentionally! Managements, however, seem to follow this\nperverse activity very cheerfully.\n\nOf course, both option grants and\nrepurchases may make sense -- but if that's the case, it's not because\nthe two activities are logically related. Rationally, a company's\ndecision to repurchase shares or to issue them should stand on its\nown feet. Just because stock has been issued to satisfy options\n-- or for any other reason -- does not mean that stock should be\nrepurchased at a price above intrinsic value. Correspondingly, a\nstock that sells well below intrinsic value should be repurchased\nwhether or not stock has previously been issued (or may be because\nof outstanding options).\n\nYou should be aware that, at certain\ntimes in the past, I have erred in\nnot\nmaking repurchases.\nMy appraisal of Berkshire's value was then too conservative or I\nwas too enthused about some alternative use of funds. We have therefore\nmissed some opportunities -- though Berkshire's trading volume at\nthese points was too light for us to have done much buying, which\nmeans that the gain in our per-share value would have been minimal.\n(A repurchase of, say, 2% of a company's shares at a 25% discount\nfrom per-share intrinsic value produces only a ½% gain in that value\nat most -- and even less if the funds could alternatively have been\ndeployed in value-building moves.)\n\nSome of the letters we've received\nclearly imply that the writer is unconcerned about intrinsic value\nconsiderations but instead wants us to trumpet an intention to repurchase\nso that the stock will rise (or quit going down). If the writer\nwants to sell tomorrow, his thinking makes sense -- for him! --\nbut if he intends to hold, he should instead hope the stock falls\nand trades in enough volume for us to buy a lot of it. That's the\nonly way a repurchase program can have any real benefit for a continuing\nshareholder.\n\nWe will not repurchase shares unless\nwe believe Berkshire stock is selling well below intrinsic value,\nconservatively calculated. Nor will we attempt to talk the stock\nup or down. (Neither publicly or privately have I ever told anyone\nto buy or sell Berkshire shares.) Instead we will give all shareholders\n-- and potential shareholders -- the same valuation-related information\nwe would wish to have if our positions were reversed.\n\nRecently, when the A shares fell\nbelow $45,000, we considered making repurchases. We decided, however,\nto delay buying, if indeed we elect to do\nany\n, until shareholders\nhave had the chance to review this report. If we do find that repurchases\nmake sense, we will only rarely place bids on the New York Stock\nExchange (\"NYSE\"). Instead, we will respond to offers made directly\nto us at or below the NYSE bid. If you wish to offer stock, have\nyour broker call Mark Millard at 402-346-1400. When a trade occurs,\nthe broker can either record it in the \"third market\" or on the\nNYSE. We will favor purchase of the B shares if they are selling\nat more than a 2% discount to the A. We will not engage in transactions\ninvolving fewer than 10 shares of A or 50 shares of B.\n\nPlease be clear about one point:\nWe will\nnever\nmake purchases with the intention of stemming\na decline in Berkshire's price. Rather we will make them if and\nwhen we believe that they represent an attractive use of the Company's\nmoney. At best, repurchases are likely to have only a very minor\neffect on the future rate of gain in our stock's intrinsic value.",

    "chunk_text": "The Annual Meeting\n\nThis year's Woodstock\nWeekend for Capitalists will follow a format slightly different\nfrom that of recent years. We need to make a change because the\nAksarben Coliseum, which served us well the past three years, is\ngradually being closed down. Therefore, we are relocating to the\nCivic Auditorium (which is on Capitol Avenue between 18\nth\n\nand 19\nth\n, behind the Doubletree Hotel), the only other\nfacility in Omaha offering the space we require.\n\nThe Civic, however, is located in\ndowntown Omaha, and we would create a parking and traffic nightmare\nif we were to meet there on a weekday. We will, therefore, convene\non Saturday, April 29, with the doors opening at 7 a. m., the movie\nbeginning at 8: 30 and the meeting itself commencing at 9: 30. As\nin the past, we will run until 3: 30 with a short break at noon for\nfood, which will be available at the Civic's concession stands.\n\nAn attachment to the proxy material\nthat is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other\nevents. As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again\nsigned up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.\nIn our normal fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels\nto the meeting. After the meeting, the buses will make trips back\nto the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the\nairport. Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.\n\nWe have scheduled the meeting in\n2002 and 2003 on the customary first Saturday in May. In 2001, however,\nthe Civic is already booked on that Saturday, so we will meet on\nApril 28. The Civic should fit our needs well on any weekend, since\nthere will then be more than ample parking in nearby lots and garages\nas well as on streets. We will also be able to greatly enlarge the\nspace we give exhibitors. So, overcoming my normal commercial reticence,\nI will see that you have a wide display of Berkshire products at\nthe Civic that you can\npurchase\n. As a benchmark, in 1999\nshareholders bought 3,059 pounds of See's candy, $16,155 of World\nBook Products, 1,928 pairs of Dexter shoes, 895 sets of Quikut knives,\n1,752 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo and 3,446 items\nof Berkshire apparel. I know you can do better.\n\nLast year, we also initiated the\nsale of at least eight fractions of Executive Jet aircraft. We will\nagain have an array of models at the Omaha airport for your inspection\non Saturday and Sunday. Ask an EJA representative at the Civic about\nviewing any of these planes.\n\nDairy Queen will also be on hand\nat the Civic and again will donate all proceeds to the Children's\nMiracle Network. Last year we sold 4,586 Dilly® bars, fudge\nbars and vanilla/orange bars. Additionally, GEICO will have a booth\nthat will be staffed by a number of our top counselors from around\nthe country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance\nquotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special\nshareholder's discount. Bring the details of your existing insurance,\nand check out whether we can save you some money.\n\nFinally, Ajit Jain and his associates\nwill be on hand to offer both no-commission annuities and a liability\npolicy with jumbo limits of a size rarely available elsewhere. Talk\nto Ajit and learn how to protect yourself and your family against\na $10 million judgment.\n\nNFM's newly remodeled complex, located\non a 75-acre site on 72\nnd\nStreet between Dodge and Pacific,\nis open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m. on weekdays and 10 a. m. to 6 p. m.\non Saturdays and Sundays. This operation offers an unrivaled breadth\nof merchandise -- furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets and\ncomputers -- all at can't-be-beat prices. In 1999 NFM did more than\n$300 million of business at its 72\nnd\nStreet location,\nwhich in a metropolitan area of 675,000 is an absolute miracle.\nDuring the Thursday, April 27 to Monday, May 1 period, any shareholder\npresenting his or her meeting credential will receive a discount\nthat is customarily given only to employees. We have offered this\nbreak to shareholders the last couple of years, and sales have been\namazing. In last year's five-day \"Berkshire Weekend,\" NFM's volume\nwas $7.98 million, an increase of 26% from 1998 and 51% from 1997.\n\nBorsheim's -- the largest jewelry\nstore in the country except for Tiffany's Manhattan store -- will\nhave two shareholder-only events. The first will be a champagne\nand dessert party from 6 p. m.-10 p. m. on Friday, April 28. The second,\nthe main gala, will be from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. on Sunday, April 30.\nOn that day, Charlie and I will be on hand to sign\nsales tickets\n.\nShareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so\nif you wish to avoid the largest crowds, which will form on Friday\nevening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as\na shareholder. On Saturday, we will be open until 7 p. m. Borsheim's\noperates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points\nbelow that of its major rivals, so be prepared to be blown away\nby both our prices and selection.\n\nIn the mall outside of Borsheim's,\nwe will again have Bob Hamman -- the best bridge player the game\nhas ever seen -- available to play with our shareholders on Sunday.\nWe will also have a few other experts playing at additional tables.\nIn 1999, we had more demand than tables, but we will cure that problem\nthis year.\n\nPatrick Wolff, twice US chess champion,\nwill again be in the mall playing blindfolded against all comers.\nHe tells me that he has never tried to play more than four games\nsimultaneously while handicapped this way but might try to bump\nthat limit to five or six this year. If you're a chess fan, take\nPatrick on -- but be sure to check his blindfold before your first\nmove.\n\nGorat's -- my favorite steakhouse\n-- will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on\nSunday, April 30, and will be serving from 4 p. m. until about midnight.\nPlease remember that you can't come to Gorat's on Sunday without\na reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 3 (\nbut\nnot before\n). If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat's on one of the\nother evenings you will be in town. I make a \"quality check\" of\nGorat's about once a week and can report that their rare T-bone\n(with a double order of hash browns) is still unequaled throughout\nthe country.\n\nThe usual baseball game will be\nheld at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p. m. on Saturday night. This year\nthe Omaha Golden Spikes will play the Iowa Cubs. Come early, because\nthat's when the real action takes place. Those who attended last\nyear saw your Chairman pitch to Ernie Banks.",

After the first\nfew pitches -- which were not my best, but when have I ever thrown\nmy best? -- I fired a brushback at Ernie just to let him know who\nwas in command. Ernie charged the mound, and I charged the plate.\nBut a clash was avoided because we became exhausted before reaching\neach other.\n\nErnie was dissatisfied with his\nperformance last year and has been studying the game films all winter.\nAs you may know, Ernie had 512 home runs in his career as a Cub.\nNow that he has spotted telltale weaknesses in my delivery, he expects\nto get #513 on April 29. I, however, have learned new ways to disguise\nmy \"flutterball.\" Come and watch this matchup.\n\nI should add that I have extracted\na promise from Ernie that he will not hit a \"come-backer\" at me\nsince I would never be able to duck in time to avoid it. My reflexes\nare like Woody Allen's, who said his were so slow that he was once\nhit by a car being pushed by two guys.\n\nOur proxy statement contains instructions\nabout obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of\nother information that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.\nJoin us at the Capitalist Caper on Capitol Avenue.\n\nMarch 1,2000\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
