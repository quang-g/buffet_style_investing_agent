    "content": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2016 was $27.5 billion, which increased the per-share book value\nof both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.7%. Over the last 52 years (that is, since present management took\nover), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $172,108, a rate of 19% compounded annually.*\nDuring the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really\ncounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our\nresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax\nthat would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large\npart “marked to market.”\nBy the early 1990 s, however, our focus was changing to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift\nthat materially diminished the relevance of balance sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the\naccounting rules (commonly referred to as “GAAP”) that apply to companies we control differ in important ways\nfrom those used to value marketable securities. Specifically, the accounting for businesses we own requires that\nthe carrying value of “losers” be written down when their failures become apparent. “Winners,” conversely, are\nnever revalued upwards.\nWe’ve experienced both outcomes: As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliver\nsurprises after the “I do’s.” I’ve made some dumb purchases, paying far too much for the economic goodwill of\ncompanies we acquired. That later led to goodwill write-offs and to consequent reductions in Berkshire’s book\nvalue. We’ve also had some winners among the businesses we’ve purchased – a few of the winners very big –\nbut have not written those up by a penny.\nWe have no quarrel with the asymmetrical accounting that applies here. But, over time, it necessarily\nwidens the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and its book value. Today, the large – and growing –\nunrecorded gains at our winners produce an intrinsic value for Berkshire’s shares that far exceeds their book\nvalue. The overage is truly huge in our property/casualty insurance business and significant also in many other\noperations.\nOver time, stock prices gravitate toward intrinsic value. That’s what has happened at Berkshire, a fact\nexplaining why the company’s 52-year market-price gain – shown on the facing page – materially exceeds its\nbook-value gain.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500 th of\nthose shown for A.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "What We Hope to Accomplish\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized\nearning power per share to increase every year. Actual earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of\nperiodic weakness in the U. S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specific\nevents may occasionally reduce earnings at Berkshire, even when most American businesses are doing well.\nIt’s our job, though, to over time deliver significant growth, bumpy or not. After all, as stewards of your\ncapital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire ranked\nfirst among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting many\nbillions of dollars more than did the runner-up. Those reinvested dollars must earn their keep.\nSome years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, the\ncash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to be\nprepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, dark\nclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’s\nimperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\nI earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investment\nactivities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps –\nmaking small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire’s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketable\nsecurities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for\n$434 million in 1993. Dexter’s value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase,\ngiving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.\nThat wreck was followed by three key happenings – two positive, one negative – that set us firmly on\nour present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn’t already own, a cash\ntransaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business.\nGEICO, with its almost unlimited potential, quickly became the centerpiece around which we built what I believe\nis now the world’s premier property/casualty business.\nUnfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock – a boatload of\nstock – to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fine\ninsurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares of\nBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My error\ncaused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the Biblical\nendorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).\nEarly in 2000, I atoned for that folly by buying 76% (since grown to 90%) of Mid American Energy, a\nbrilliantly-managed utility business that has delivered us many large opportunities to make profitable and\nsocially-useful investments. The Mid American cash purchase – I was learning – firmly launched us on our\npresent course of (1) continuing to build our insurance operation; (2) energetically acquiring large and diversified\nnon-insurance businesses and (3) largely making our deals from internally-generated cash. (Today, I would rather\nprep for a colonoscopy than issue Berkshire shares.)\nOur portfolio of bonds and stocks, de-emphasized though it is, has continued in the post-1998 period to\ngrow and to deliver us hefty capital gains, interest, and dividends. Those portfolio earnings have provided us\nmajor help in financing the purchase of businesses. Though unconventional, Berkshire’s two-pronged approach\nto capital allocation gives us a real edge.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "It’s true, of course, that American owners of homes, autos and other assets have often borrowed heavily\nto finance their purchases. If an owner defaults, however, his or her asset does not disappear or lose its\nusefulness. Rather, ownership customarily passes to an American lending institution that then disposes of it to an\nAmerican buyer. Our nation’s wealth remains intact. As Gertrude Stein put it, “Money is always there, but the\npockets change.”\nAbove all, it’s our market system – an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor –\nthat has created America’s abundance. This system has also been the primary factor in allocating rewards.\nGovernmental redirection, through federal, state and local taxation, has in addition determined the distribution of\na significant portion of the bounty.\nAmerica has, for example, decided that those citizens in their productive years should help both the old\nand the young. Such forms of aid – sometimes enshrined as “entitlements” – are generally thought of as applying\nto the aged. But don’t forget that four million American babies are born each year with an entitlement to a public\neducation. That societal commitment, largely financed at the local level, costs about $150,000 per baby. The\n⁄\nannual cost totals more than $600 billion, which is about 31 % of GDP.\nHowever our wealth may be divided, the mind-boggling amounts you see around you belong almost\nexclusively to Americans. Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Those\nholdings, however, are of little importance to our national balance sheet: Our citizens own assets abroad that are\nroughly comparable in value.\nEarly Americans, we should emphasize, were neither smarter nor more hard working than those people\nwho toiled century after century before them. But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashed\nhuman potential, and their successors built upon it.\nThis economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, the\nbuild-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not, however, be stopped. I’ll\nrepeat what I’ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are the\nluckiest crop in history.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAmerica’s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20 th\ncentury the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materially\nboosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced a\nfurther 72%, to 19,763.\nAmerican business – and consequently a basket of stocks – is virtually certain to be worth far more in\nthe years ahead. Innovation, productivity gains, entrepreneurial spirit and an abundance of capital will see to that.\nEver-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on the\nnonsense they peddle.\nMany companies, of course, will fall behind, and some will fail. Winnowing of that sort is a product of\nmarket dynamism. Moreover, the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines – even panics –\nthat will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur – not me, not Charlie, not\neconomists, not the media. Meg Mc Connell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: “We\nspend a lot of time looking for systemic risk; in truth, however, it tends to find us.”\nDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as\nan investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be\nunwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with a\ncollection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well.\nAs for Berkshire, our size precludes a brilliant result: Prospective returns fall as assets increase.\nNonetheless, Berkshire’s collection of good businesses, along with the company’s impregnable financial strength\nand owner-oriented culture, should deliver decent results. We won’t be satisfied with less.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Share Repurchases\nIn the investment world, discussions about share repurchases often become heated. But I’d suggest that\nparticipants in this debate take a deep breath: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn’t that complicated.\nFrom the standpoint of exiting shareholders, repurchases are always a plus. Though the day-to-day impact of\nthese purchases is usually minuscule, it’s always better for a seller to have an additional buyer in the market.\nFor continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price\nbelow intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic\nvalue. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is bought\nout by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exiting\npartner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies with\ncorporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or\nvalue-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.\nIt is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above\nwhich repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn’t be the case if a management was buying an outside\nbusiness. There, price would always factor into a buy-or-pass decision.\nWhen CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seem\noblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few owners\nand were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not.\nIt is important to remember that there are two occasions in which repurchases should not take place,\neven if the company’s shares are underpriced. One is when a business both needs all its available money to\nprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need for\nfunds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting it\nafter the needed expenditures are made.\nThe second exception, less common, materializes when a business acquisition (or some other investment\nopportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago,\nBerkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. At our present size, the issue is far less likely to\narise.\nMy suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, join\nhands and in unison declare, “What is smart at one price is stupid at another.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nTo recap Berkshire’s own repurchase policy: I am authorized to buy large amounts of Berkshire shares at\n120% or less of book value because our Board has concluded that purchases at that level clearly bring an instant and\nmaterial benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount to\nBerkshire’s intrinsic value, a spread that is appropriate because calculations of intrinsic value can’t be precise.\nThe authorization given me does not mean that we will “prop” our stock’s price at the 120% ratio. If\nthat level is reached, we will instead attempt to blend a desire to make meaningful purchases at a value-creating\nprice with a related goal of not over-influencing the market.\nTo date, repurchasing our shares has proved hard to do. That may well be because we have been clear in\ndescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire’s intrinsic value is\nsignificantly higher than 120% of book value. If so, that’s fine. Charlie and I prefer to see Berkshire shares sell in\na fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price – it’s no\nfun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases – nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out\n“partners” at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances could\ncreate a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders. If so, we will be\nready to act.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nOne final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people\nhave come close to calling them un-American – characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds\nneeded for productive endeavors. That simply isn’t the case: Both American corporations and private investors\nare today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I’m not aware of any enticing project that in recent\nyears has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)",

    "content": "Insurance\nLet’s now look at Berkshire’s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance.\nThe property/casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.\nToday, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,\npayments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large\nsums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for\ntheir own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds\nusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our\nfloat. And how it has grown, as the following table shows:\nYear Float (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 237\n1990 1,632\n2000 27,871\n2010 65,832\n2016 91,577\nWe recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-time\nboost, float at GEICO and several of our specialized operations is almost certain to grow at a good clip. National\nIndemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whose float is certain\nto drift downward.\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual – at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to\nimmediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is by\ndesign and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will never be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers\nan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we\nenjoy the use of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the\ninsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning\nsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "This outcome is made more certain by the dramatically lower interest rates that now exist throughout the\nworld. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies – though not those of Berkshire – are heavily\nconcentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding a\npittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it’s a good bet that industry\nresults over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case of\ncompanies that specialize in reinsurance.\nNevertheless, I very much like our own prospects. Berkshire’s unrivaled financial strength allows us far\nmore flexibility in investing than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us\nare always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, our\nchoices expand.\nMoreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. That\nrecord is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers, who know\nthat while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that\nmessage lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount\nof our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to\nthink of float as a typical liability is a major mistake. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we\npay old claims and related expenses – a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 – and that\nreduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to\nfloat.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out\nthe door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that is included in our book-value figure. In very large part, this goodwill represents\nthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,\nhowever, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged\nunderwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original\ncost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion\nwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion.\nYet we have subsequently increased our float by $64 billion, a gain that in no way is reflected in our book value.\nThis unrecorded asset is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value far\nexceeds its book value.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the\nmajor units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures\nrisks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed,\ndecisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes\nBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Indeed, Berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple\nanything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a large profit for the year. Our many\nstreams of non-insurance earnings would see to that. Additionally, we would remain awash in cash and be eager\nto write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and\nreinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.\nWhen Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our\nsmall and struggling reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created\ntens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me\nfor him, don’t hesitate. Make the trade!\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed until recently by Tad Montross. After\n39 years at General Re, Tad retired in 2016. Tad was a class act in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks.\nKara Raiguel, who has worked with Ajit for 16 years, is now CEO of General Re.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure\nactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit\nafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the\nappropriate premium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on\nbusiness that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must\nas well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Tad never listened to that\nnonsensical excuse for sloppy underwriting, and neither will Kara.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFinally, there is GEICO, the company that set my heart afire 66 years ago (and for which the flame still\nburns). GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 55 years of service in\n2016.\nTony became CEO of GEICO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is no better\nmanager than Tony, who brings his combination of brilliance, dedication and soundness to the job. (The latter\nquality is essential to sustained success. As Charlie says, it’s great to have a manager with a 160 IQ – unless he\nthinks it’s 180.) Like Ajit, Tony has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire.\nOn my initial visit to GEICO in 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company\nenjoyed over the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deserved to\nsucceed. The company’s annual sales were then $8 million; In 2016, GEICO did that much business every three\nhours of the year.\nAuto insurance is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and only a low-cost\noperation can deliver those. In fact, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with\nGEICO. So stop reading – right now! – and go to geico. com or call 800-847-7536.\nGEICO’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. As a result,\nthe company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That’s up\nfrom 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to\n36,085.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "GEICO’s growth accelerated dramatically during the second half of 2016. Loss costs throughout the\nauto-insurance industry had been increasing at an unexpected pace and some competitors lost their enthusiasm\nfor taking on new customers. GEICO’s reaction to the profit squeeze, however, was to accelerate its\nnew-business efforts. We like to make hay while the sun sets, knowing that it will surely rise again.\nGEICO continues on a roll as I send you this letter. When insurance prices increase, people shop more.\nAnd when they shop, GEICO wins.\nHave you called yet? (800-847-7536 or go to geico. com)\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a collection of smaller companies that\nprimarily write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation\nthat consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually one much superior to that reported by their competitors.\nOver the past 14 years, this group has earned $4.7 billion from underwriting – about 13% of its premium\nvolume – while increasing its float from $943 million to $11.6 billion.\nLess than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which is\nincluded in this grouping. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge, a move that proved to be a\nhome run: We expected significant losses in the early years while Peter built the personnel and infrastructure\nneeded for a world-wide operation. Instead, he and his crew delivered significant underwriting profits throughout\nthe start-up period. BHSI’s volume increased 40% in 2016, reaching $1.3 billion. It’s clear to me that the\ncompany is destined to become one of the world’s leading P/C insurers.\nHere’s a recap of pre-tax underwriting earnings and float by division:\n\nUnderwriting Profit Yearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2016 2015 2016 2015\nBH Reinsurance .................................... $ 822 $ 421 $ 45,081 $ 44,108\nGeneral Re ........................................... 190 132 17,699 18,560\nGEICO ................................................ 462 460 17,148 15,148\nOther Primary ....................................... 657 824 11,649 9,906\n$2,131 $1,837 $ 91,577 $ 87,722\n\nBerkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide\nmoats amount to something unique in the insurance world.

    "content": "Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), our 90%-owned utility business, share\nimportant characteristics that distinguish them from Berkshire’s other activities. Consequently, we assign them\ntheir own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and\nincome statement. These two very major companies accounted for 33% of Berkshire’s after-tax operating\nearnings last year.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets,\nwith these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\nin fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would\nfar exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF’s interest\ncoverage was more than 6: 1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to\ninterest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all\ncircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these\ncompanies offering an essential service for which demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by few\nother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by\nany single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of the\ncompany being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower\ntheir cost of debt. That economic fact benefits both us and our customers.\nAll told, BHE and BNSF invested $8.9 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment\nto their segments of America’s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise\nreasonable returns – and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital\nproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our\nself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they\nrepresent.\nLow prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE’s average retail rate is\n7.1¢ per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.9¢. Here are the comparable\nindustry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0¢, Missouri 9.5¢, Illinois 9.2¢, Minnesota 10.0¢. The national\naverage is 10.3¢. We have promised Iowans that our base rates will not increase until 2029 at the earliest. Our\nrock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\nAt BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of\nsignificant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried. To supply a very\ncrude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of the\nother four major U. S.-based railroads ranged from 4¢ to 5¢.\nBoth BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no\nstate comes close to rivaling Iowa, where last year the megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 55% of\nall megawatt-hours sold to our Iowa retail customers. New wind projects that are underway will take that figure\nto 89% by 2020.\nBargain-basement electric rates carry second-order benefits with them. Iowa has attracted large hightech installations, both because of its low prices for electricity (which data centers use in huge quantities) and\nbecause most tech CEOs are enthusiastic about using renewable energy. When it comes to wind energy, Iowa is\nthe Saudi Arabia of America.\nBNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight\nalmost 500 miles. Those economics make railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads\nalleviate highway congestion – and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier\ntraffic – in a major way.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nAll told, BHE and BNSF own assets that are of major importance to our country as well as to\nshareholders of Berkshire. Here are the key financial figures for both:\n\n[[TABLE_BLOCK]]\n\nHome Services may appear out of place in the above table. But it came with our purchase of\nMid American (now BHE) in 1999 – and we are lucky that it did.\nHome Services owns 38 realty companies with more than 29,000 agents who operate in 28 states. Last\nyear it purchased four realtors, including Houlihan Lawrence, the leader in New York’s Westchester County (in a\ntransaction that closed shortly after yearend).\nIn real estate parlance, representing either a buyer or a seller is called a “side,” with the representation of\nboth counting as two sides. Last year, our owned realtors participated in 244,000 sides, totaling $86 billion in\nvolume.\nHome Services also franchises many operations throughout the country that use our name. We like both\naspects of the real estate business and expect to acquire many realtors and franchisees during the next decade.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Manufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur manufacturing, service and retailing operations sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes.\nLet’s look, though, at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group.\n\n[[TABLE_BLOCK]]\n\nOther current assets ............................. 1,039\nTotal current assets ............................. 36,022\nDeferred taxes................................ 12,044\n\n[[TABLE_BLOCK]]\n\nIncluded in this financial summary are 44 businesses that report directly to headquarters. But some of\nthese companies, in turn, have many individual operations under their umbrella. For example, Marmon has 175\nseparate business units, serving widely disparate markets, and Berkshire Hathaway Automotive owns 83\ndealerships, operating in nine states.\nThis collection of businesses is truly a motley crew. Some operations, measured by earnings on\nunleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific returns that, in a couple of instances, exceed 100%. Most are solid\nbusinesses generating good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nA few, however – these are serious blunders I made in my job of capital allocation – produce very poor\nreturns. In most cases, I was wrong when I originally sized up the economic characteristics of these companies or\nthe industries in which they operate, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. In a couple of\ninstances, I stumbled in assessing either the fidelity or ability of incumbent managers or ones I later put in place.\nI will commit more errors; you can count on that. Fortunately, Charlie – never bashful – is around to say “no” to\nmy worst ideas.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in the manufacturing, service and retailing group are an\nexcellent business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2016 and, despite their\nholding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned 24% after-tax on that capital.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price.\nWe have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the\nlarge figure we show on our balance sheet for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a\ndecent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Absent a recession, earnings from the group will\nlikely grow in 2017, in part because Duracell and Precision Castparts (both bought in 2016) will for the first time\ncontribute a full year’s earnings to this group. Additionally, Duracell incurred significant transitional costs in\n2016 that will not recur.\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses, we might be disadvantaged\nif outsiders knew our numbers. Therefore, in certain of our operations that are not of a size material to an\nevaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about\nmany of our operations on pages 90 - 94. Be aware, though, that it’s the growth of the Berkshire forest that\ncounts. It would be foolish to focus over-intently on any single tree.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFor several years I have told you that the income and expense data shown in this section does not\nconform to GAAP. I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rules\nregarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periods\naveraging about 19 years. In our opinion, most of those amortization “expenses” are not truly an economic cost.\nOur goal in diverging from GAAP in this section is to present the figures to you in a manner reflecting the way in\nwhich Charlie and I view and analyze them.\nOn page 54 we itemize $15.4 billion of intangibles that are yet to be amortized by annual charges to\nearnings. (More intangibles to be amortized will be created as we make new acquisitions.) On that page, we show\nthat the 2016 amortization charge to GAAP earnings was $1.5 billion, up $384 million from 2015. My judgment\nis that about 20% of the 2016 charge is a “real” cost.\nEventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens – most often at the\n15-year mark – the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlying\neconomics of Berkshire’s business. (My gift to my successor.)\nNow that I’ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a less\npleasant distortion produced by accounting rules. The subject this time is GAAP-prescribed depreciation charges,\nwhich are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understate true\neconomic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970 s and early 1980 s, when\ninflation was rampant. As inflation subsided – thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker – the inadequacy of\ndepreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time, in the railroad industry,\nwhere current costs for many depreciable items far outstrip historical costs. The inevitable result is that reported\nearnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.",

    "content": "[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nAt BNSF, to get down to particulars, our GAAP depreciation charge last year was $2.1 billion. But were\nwe to spend that sum and no more annually, our railroad would soon deteriorate and become less competitive.\nThe reality is that – simply to hold our own – we need to spend far more than the cost we show for depreciation.\nMoreover, a wide disparity will prevail for decades.\nAll that said, Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our better purchases.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nToo many managements – and the number seems to grow every year – are looking for any means to\nreport, and indeed feature, “adjusted earnings” that are higher than their company’s GAAP earnings. There are\nmany ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of\n“restructuring costs” and “stock-based compensation” as expenses.\nCharlie and I want managements, in their commentary, to describe unusual items – good or bad – that\naffect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of the\nfuture. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting “adjusted\nper-share earnings” makes us nervous. That’s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look for\nways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be “helpful” as well. Goals\nlike that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed many\nindustry participants.\nCharlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always “make the\nnumbers.” In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur.\nWhen they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make up the numbers.\nLet’s get back to the two favorites of “don’t-count-this” managers, starting with “restructuring.”\nBerkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. Owning only a northern\ntextile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year at\nBerkshire. That’s because there are always things that need to change in our hundreds of businesses. Last year, as\nI mentioned earlier, we spent significant sums getting Duracell in shape for the decades ahead.\nWe have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating our\nnormal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mention\nit in my commentary. Indeed, when there is a total rebasing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinz\nmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations be\nexplained clearly to owners. That’s precisely what the CEO of Kraft Heinz has done, in a manner approved by\nthe company’s directors (who include me). But, to tell owners year after year, “Don’t count this,” when\nmanagement is simply making business adjustments that are necessary, is misleading. And too many analysts and\njournalists fall for this baloney.\nTo say “stock-based compensation” is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down that\nroad are, in effect, saying to shareholders, “If you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don’t worry\nabout its effect on earnings. I’ll ‘adjust’ it away.”\nTo explore this maneuver further, join me for a moment in a visit to a make-believe accounting\nlaboratory whose sole mission is to juice Berkshire’s reported earnings. Imaginative technicians await us, eager\nto show their stuff.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nListen carefully while I tell these enablers that stock-based compensation usually comprises at least 20%\nof total compensation for the top three or four executives at most large companies. Pay attention, too, as I explain\nthat Berkshire has several hundred such executives at its subsidiaries and pays them similar amounts, but uses\nonly cash to do so. I further confess that, lacking imagination, I have counted all of these payments to\nBerkshire’s executives as an expense.\nMy accounting minions suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid these\nBerkshire managers is tantamount to “cash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation” and is therefore not a\n“true” expense. So – presto! – Berkshire, too, can have “adjusted” earnings.\nBack to reality: If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they should\nbe required to affirm to their owners one of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not a\ncost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings.\nDuring the accounting nonsense that flourished during the 1960 s, the story was told of a CEO who, as\nhis company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, “What is two plus two?” The answer that won\nthe assignment, of course, was, “What number do you have in mind?”",

    "content": "Finance and Financial Products\nOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and\nMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). Each is the leader in\nits field.\nWe also include Clayton Homes in this section. This company receives most of its revenue from the sale\nof manufactured homes, but derives the bulk of its earnings from its large mortgage portfolio. Last year, Clayton\nbecame America’s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new American\nhomes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollar volume than Clayton because they sell site-built\nhomes that command much higher prices.)\nIn 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in\n2016, and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton’s unit sales in 2017\nand will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.\nEven so, Clayton’s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of new\nAmerican homes costing less than $150,000. Clayton manufactures close to one-half of the total. That is a far cry\nfrom Clayton’s position in 2003 when Berkshire purchased the company. It then ranked third in the industry in\nunits sold and employed 6,731 people. Now, when its new acquisitions are included, the employee count is\n14,677. And that number will increase in the future.\nClayton’s earnings in recent years have materially benefited from extraordinarily low interest rates. The\ncompany’s mortgage loans to home-buyers are at fixed-rates and for long terms (averaging 25 years at\ninception). But Clayton’s own borrowings are short-term credits that re-price frequently. When rates plunge,\nClayton’s earnings from its portfolio greatly increase. We normally would shun that kind of lend-long, borrowshort approach, which can cause major problems for financial institutions. As a whole, however, Berkshire is\nalways asset-sensitive, meaning that higher short-term rates will benefit our consolidated earnings, even as they\nhurt at Clayton.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nLast year Clayton had to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured-housing mortgages, about 2.5% of its total\nportfolio. Customer demographics help explain that percentage. Clayton’s customers are usually lower-income\nfamilies with mediocre credit scores; many are supported by jobs that will be at risk in any recession; many,\nsimilarly, have financial profiles that will be damaged by divorce or death to an extent that would not be typical\nfor a high-income family. Those risks that our customers face are partly mitigated because almost all have a\nstrong desire to own a home and because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587,\nincluding the cost of insurance and property taxes.\nClayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties. The two most popular are\nloan extensions and payment forgiveness. Last year about 11,000 borrowers received extensions, and 3,800 had\n$3.4 million of scheduled payments permanently canceled by Clayton. The company does not earn interest or\nfees when these loss-mitigation moves are made. Our experience is that 93% of borrowers helped through these\nprograms in the last two years now remain in their homes. Since we lose significant sums on\nforeclosures – losses last year totaled $150 million – our assistance programs end up helping Clayton as well as\nits borrowers.\nClayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership. Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-class\nmanagement group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufacturedhome industry fell apart during the Great Recession. (As other lenders to the industry vanished, Clayton supplied\ncredit not only to its own dealers but also to dealers who sold the products of its competitors.) At Berkshire, we\nnever count on synergies when we acquire companies. Truly important ones, however, surfaced after our\npurchase of Clayton.\nMarmon’s railcar business experienced a major slowdown in demand last year, which will cause\nearnings to decline in 2017. Fleet utilization was 91% in December, down from 97% a year earlier, with the drop\nparticularly severe at the large fleet we purchased from General Electric in 2015. Marmon’s crane and container\nrentals have weakened as well.\nBig swings in railcar demand have occurred in the past and they will continue. Nevertheless, we very\nmuch like this business and expect decent returns on equity capital over the years. Tank cars are Marmon’s\nspecialty. People often associate tank cars with the transportation of crude oil; in fact, they are essential to a great\nvariety of shippers.\nOver time, we expect to expand our railcar operation. Meanwhile, Marmon is making a number of\nbolt-on acquisitions whose results are included in the Manufacturing, Service and Retailing section.\nHere’s the pre-tax earnings recap for our finance-related companies:\n\n[[TABLE_BLOCK]]\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock – now 30 cents annually – should rise above\n44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If the\ncommon dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediately\nbefore it expires.\nMany of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite\naggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases\nbeen underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows and\noutstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIt’s important for you to understand that 95% of the $86 billion of “cash and equivalents” (which in my\nmind includes U. S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and,\nconsequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax. Moreover, repatriation of the remaining funds would trigger\nonly minor taxes because much of that money has been earned in countries that themselves impose meaningful\ncorporate taxes. Those payments become an offset to U. S. tax when money is brought home.\nThese explanations are important because many cash-rich American companies hold a large portion of\ntheir funds in jurisdictions imposing very low taxes. Such companies hope – and may well be proved right – that\nthe tax levied for bringing these funds to America will soon be materially reduced. In the meantime, these\ncompanies are limited as to how they can use that cash. In other words, off-shore cash is simply not worth as\nmuch as cash held at home.\nBerkshire has a partial offset to the favorable geographical location of its cash, which is that much of it\nis held in our insurance subsidiaries. Though we have many alternatives for investing this cash, we do not have\nthe unlimited choices that we would enjoy if the cash were held by the parent company, Berkshire. We do have\nan ability annually to distribute large amounts of cash from our insurers to the parent – though here, too, there are\nlimits. Overall, cash held at our insurers is a very valuable asset, but one slightly less valuable to us than is cash\nheld at the parent level.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks “forever.” It is\ntrue that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we’re talking\n20/20 vision). But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever.\nConfusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on\npages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled\nbusinesses, not marketable securities. This year I’ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our owners\nunderstand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBefore we leave this investment section, a few educational words about dividends and taxes: Berkshire,\nlike most corporations, nets considerably more from a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capital\ngains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains as\nthe route to tax-favored returns.\nBut here’s the corporate math. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it\n35 cents of federal income tax (and often state income tax as well). The tax on dividends received from domestic\ncorporations, however, is consistently lower, though rates vary depending on the status of the recipient.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]\n\nFor a non-insurance company – which describes Berkshire Hathaway, the parent – the federal tax rate is\n⁄\neffectively 101 cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than\n20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to the\nsubstantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company.\n(The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid its\nown corporate tax on the earnings being distributed.)\nBerkshire’s insurance subsidiaries pay a tax rate on dividends that is somewhat higher than that applying\nto non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualty\ncompanies owe about 14% in taxes on most dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though, to about 11% if\nthey own more than 20% of a U. S.-based investee.\nAnd that’s our tax lesson for today.",

    "content": "“The Bet” (or how your money finds its way to Wall Street)\nIn this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and,\nnext, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, a\nunique establishment that played a role in the bet.\nLong Bets was seeded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization that\nadministers just what you’d guess: long-term bets. To participate, “proposers” post a proposition at Longbets. org\nthat will be proved right or wrong at a distant date. They then wait for a contrary-minded party to take the other\nside of the bet. When a “doubter” steps forward, each side names a charity that will be the beneficiary if its side\nwins; parks its wager with Long Bets; and posts a short essay defending its position on the Long Bets website.\nWhen the bet is concluded, Long Bets pays off the winning charity.\nHere are examples of what you will find on Long Bets’ very interesting site:\nIn 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that “By 2029 no computer – or ‘machine intelligence’ – will\nhave passed the Turing Test,” which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being.\nInventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don’t know who will\nwin this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.\nThat same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers\nby 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn\nEric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He\npromptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I’ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment,\nshould we lose.)\nNow, to my bet and its history. In Berkshire’s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investment\nmanagement by professionals – in aggregate – would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved by\nrank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of “helpers” would leave\ntheir clients – again in aggregate – worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost index\nfund. (See pages 114 - 115 for a reprint of the argument as I originally stated it in the 2005 report.)\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Subsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at least\nfive hedge funds – wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles – that would over an extended period match\nthe performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet and\nnamed a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade of\nfund managers – who could include their own fund as one of the five – to come forth and defend their\noccupation. After all, these managers urged others to bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting\na little of their own money on the line?\nWhat followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managers\nwho have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man – Ted Seides –\nstepped up to my challenge. Ted was a co-manager of Protégé Partners, an asset manager that had raised money\nfrom limited partners to form a fund-of-funds – in other words, a fund that invests in multiple hedge funds.\nI hadn’t known Ted before our wager, but I like him and admire his willingness to put his money where\nhis mouth was. He has been both straight-forward with me and meticulous in supplying all the data that both he\nand I have needed to monitor the bet.\nFor Protégé Partners’ side of our ten-year bet, Ted picked five funds-of-funds whose results were to be\naveraged and compared against my Vanguard S&P index fund. The five he selected had invested their money in\nmore than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not be\ndistorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.\nEach fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedge\nfunds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlying\nhedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fund\nmanagers.\nHere are the results for the first nine years of the bet – figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,\nthe charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly opening\nthe mail next January.\nFund of Fund of Fund of Fund of Fund of S&P\nYear Funds A Funds B Funds C Funds D Funds E Index Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%\n2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%\n2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%\n2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%\n2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%\n2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%\n2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%\n2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%\n2016 -2.9% 1.7% -1.4% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%\nGain to\nDate 8.7% 28.3% 62.8% 2.9% 7.5% 85.4%\nFootnote: Under my agreement with Protégé Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never\nbeen publicly disclosed. I, however, see their annual audits.\nThe compounded annual increase to date for the index fund is 7.1%, which is a return that could easily\nprove typical for the stock market over time. That’s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for the\nmarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,\nbecause many hold large “short” positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stocks\nwould have provided a tailwind for index funds.\nInstead we operated in what I would call a “neutral” environment. In it, the five funds-of-funds\ndelivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested in\nthose funds would have gained $220,000. The index fund would meanwhile have gained $854,000.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "Bear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a huge\nfinancial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected were\nsimilarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled to\nperformance fees based on the results of the underlying funds.\nI’m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But\nthe results for their investors were dismal – really dismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the\nfunds and funds-of-funds involved – fees that were totally unwarranted by performance – were such that their\nmanagers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. As Gordon Gekko might have\nput it: “Fees never sleep.”\nThe underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners that\nlikely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of “2 and 20,” meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,\npayable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by bad\nones). Under this lopsided arrangement, a hedge fund operator’s ability to simply pile up assets under\nmanagement has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performed\npoorly.\nStill, we’re not through with fees. Remember, there were the fund-of-funds managers to be fed as well.\nThese managers received an additional fixed amount that was usually set at 1% of assets. Then, despite the\nterrible overall record of the five funds-of-funds, some experienced a few good years and collected\n“performance” fees. Consequently, I estimate that over the nine-year period roughly 60% – gulp! – of all gains\nachieved by the five funds-of-funds were diverted to the two levels of managers. That was their misbegotten\nreward for accomplishing something far short of what their many hundreds of limited partners could have\neffortlessly – and with virtually no cost – achieved on their own.\nIn my opinion, the disappointing results for hedge-fund investors that this bet exposed are almost certain\nto recur in the future. I laid out my reasons for that belief in a statement that was posted on the Long Bets website\nwhen the bet commenced (and that is still posted there). Here is what I asserted:\nOver a ten-year period commencing on January 1,2008, and ending on December 31,2017,\nthe S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance is\nmeasured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses.\nA lot of very smart people set out to do better than average in securities markets. Call them\nactive investors.\nTheir opposites, passive investors, will by definition do about average. In aggregate their\npositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance of\nthe universe—the active investors—must do about average as well. However, these\ninvestors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costs\nwill be worse than those of the passive investors.\nCosts skyrocket when large annual fees, large performance fees, and active trading costs are\nall added to the active investor’s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this cost\nproblem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge funds\nin which the funds of funds are invested.\nA number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their\nefforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on\ninvestors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund\nthan with a group of funds of funds.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "So that was my argument – and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A (active investors)\nand Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve average\nresults before costs, so, too, must A. Whichever group has the lower costs will win. (The academic in me requires\nme to mention that there is a very minor point – not worth detailing – that slightly modifies this formulation.)\nAnd if Group A has exorbitant costs, its shortfall will be substantial.\nThere are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over long\nstretches. In my lifetime, though, I’ve identified – early on – only ten or so professionals that I expected would\naccomplish this feat.\nThere are no doubt many hundreds of people – perhaps thousands – whom I have never met and whose\nabilities would equal those of the people I’ve identified. The job, after all, is not impossible. The problem simply\nis that the great majority of managers who attempt to over-perform will fail. The probability is also very high that\nthe person soliciting your funds will not be the exception who does well. Bill Ruane – a truly wonderful human\nbeing and a man whom I identified 60 years ago as almost certain to deliver superior investment returns over the\nlong haul – said it well: “In investment management, the progression is from the innovators to the imitators to the\nswarming incompetents.”\nFurther complicating the search for the rare high-fee manager who is worth his or her pay is the fact that\nsome investment professionals, just as some amateurs, will be lucky over short periods. If 1,000 managers make\na market prediction at the beginning of a year, it’s very likely that the calls of at least one will be correct for nine\nconsecutive years. Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet.\nBut there would remain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest with\nhim.\nFinally, there are three connected realities that cause investing success to breed failure. First, a good\nrecord quickly attracts a torrent of money. Second, huge sums invariably act as an anchor on investment\nperformance: What is easy with millions, struggles with billions (sob!). Third, most managers will nevertheless\nseek new money because of their personal equation – namely, the more funds they have under management, the\nmore their fees.\nThese three points are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million, I\nwrote my limited partners: “I feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to help\nthem. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results. Therefore, . . .\nI intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up to\nher to find some other partnership for them.”\nThe bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will\nusually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick\nwith low-cost index funds.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIf a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the handsdown choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.\nIn his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who have\npromised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing – or, as in our bet, less than nothing – of\nadded value.\nIn his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today,\nhowever, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their\nsavings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOver the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve\nlearned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index\nfund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed\nthat same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and\ndepart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another\nbreed of hyper-helper called a consultant.\nThat professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients,\nyear after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Large\nfees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That\nadvice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or current\neconomic trends make the shift appropriate.\nThe wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling,\nentertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy them\nsomething superior compared to what the masses receive.\nIn many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason,\nthe financial “elites” – wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like – have great trouble\nmeekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few\nthousand dollars. This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is –on an\nexpectancy basis – clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elite\nfor superior investment advice has caused it, in aggregate, to waste more than $100 billion over the past decade.\nFigure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money in\nhedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall is\nconservative.\nMuch of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees. Many of these funds are\nwoefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performance\naccompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by local\ntaxpayers.\nHuman behavior won’t change. Wealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like will\ncontinue to feel they deserve something “extra” in investment advice. Those advisors who cleverly play to this\nexpectation will get very rich. This year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. The\nlikely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: “When a person with money meets a person\nwith experience, the one with experience ends up with the money and the one with money leaves with\nexperience.”\nLong ago, a brother-in-law of mine, Homer Rogers, was a commission agent working in the Omaha\nstockyards. I asked him how he induced a farmer or rancher to hire him to handle the sale of their hogs or cattle\nto the buyers from the big four packers (Swift, Cudahy, Wilson and Armour). After all, hogs were hogs and the\nbuyers were experts who knew to the penny how much any animal was worth. How then, I asked Homer, could\nany sales agent get a better result than any other?\nHomer gave me a pitying look and said: “Warren, it’s not how you sell ‘em, it’s how you tell ‘em.”\nWhat worked in the stockyards continues to work in Wall Street.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnd, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.\nBerkshire loves to pay fees – even outrageous fees – to investment bankers who bring us acquisitions. Moreover,\nwe have paid substantial sums for over-performance to our two in-house investment managers – and we hope to\nmake even larger payments to them in the future.\nTo get biblical (Ephesians 3: 18), I know the height and the depth and the length and the breadth of the\nenergy flowing from that simple four-letter word – fees – when it is spoken to Wall Street. And when that energy\ndelivers value to Berkshire, I will cheerfully write a big check.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "The Annual Meeting\nLast year we partnered with Yahoo to air the first-ever webcast of our annual meeting. Thanks to Andy\nSerwer and his Yahoo crew, the production was a success in all respects, registering 1.1 million unique visits in\nreal-time viewing and 11.5 million more in replays (many of those, to be sure, called up by viewers interested in\nonly certain segments of the webcast).\nBerkshire’s thank-you mail for initiating the webcast included many notes from three constituencies: the\nelderly who find travel difficult; the thrifty who find it expensive to travel to Omaha; and those who cannot\nattend a Saturday meeting for religious reasons.\nThe webcast cut attendance at last year’s meeting to about 37,000 people (we can’t get a precise count),\nwhich was down about 10%. Nevertheless, both Berkshire’s subsidiaries and Omaha hotels and restaurants\nracked up huge sales. Nebraska Furniture Mart’s sales broke their 2015 record volume by 3%, with the Omaha\nstore recording one-week volume of $45.5 million.\nOur Berkshire exhibitors at Century Link were open from noon until 5 p. m. on Friday and drew a crowd\nof 12,000 bargain-hunting shareholders. We will repeat those Friday shopping hours this year on May 5 th. Bring\nmoney.\nThe annual meeting falls on May 6 th and will again be webcast by Yahoo, whose web address is\nhttps://finance. yahoo. com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 9 a. m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo will\ninterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Both\nthose interviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.\nFor those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the Century Link will open at 7: 00 a. m. on\nSaturday to facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8: 30. The question-and-answer\nperiod will start at 9: 30 and run until 3: 30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3: 45 we will begin the\nformal shareholder meeting. It will run an hour or so. That is somewhat longer than usual because three proxy\nitems are to be presented by their proponents, who will be given a reasonable amount of time to state their case.\nOn Saturday morning, we will have our sixth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target\nwill again be the porch of a Clayton Home, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a\nteenager – in my one brief flirtation with honest labor – I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty\ngood at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and\nyou must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed). The competition will begin about 7: 45, and I’ll take on\nten or so competitors selected a few minutes earlier by my assistant, Deb Bosanek.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will be\ncaptaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our companies.\nYour children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the\nmeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual “Berkshire 5 K,” an 8 a. m. race\nstarting at the Century Link. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent\nto you with your meeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of\nBerkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanut\nbrittle we eat throughout the Saturday meeting takes its toll.) Participation in the 5 K grows every year. Help us\nset another record.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

Keep in mind that airlines have\nsometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend – though I must admit I have developed some tolerance,\nbordering on enthusiasm, for that practice now that Berkshire has made large investments in America’s four\nmajor carriers. Nevertheless, if you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.\nOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21/ hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\nsignificant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must\nmake your purchases between Tuesday, May 2 nd and Monday, May 8 th inclusive, and must also present your\nmeeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious\nmanufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder\nweekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend,” NFM\nwill be open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m. Monday through Friday, 10 a. m. to 9: 30 p. m. on Saturday and 10 a. m. to 8\np. m. on Sunday. From 5: 30 p. m. to 8 p. m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited.\nThis year we have good news for shareholders in the Kansas City and Dallas metro markets who can’t\nattend the meeting or perhaps prefer the webcast. From May 2 nd through May 8 th, shareholders who present\nmeeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such as brokerage statements) to their local\nNFM store will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omaha store.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p. m. to 9 p. m. on Friday, May 5 th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 7 th, from 9\na. m. to 4 p. m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p. m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save\n(or so my daughter tells me when we visit the store).\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, May 1 st through Saturday, May 13 th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement\nshowing you own our stock.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician and motivational\nspeaker from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon\nOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. If\nthey suggest wagering on the game, change the subject. I will join them at some point and hope Ajit, Charlie and\nBill Gates will do so also.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I\nmet Ariel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented the\nUnited States in the 2012 Olympics. Now, she’s a senior at Princeton (after interning last summer at JPMorgan\nChase). If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p. m. Bill Gates did\npretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.)\nGorat’s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 7 th, serving from 1 p. m.\nuntil 10 p. m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 3 rd (but not before). Show you are a\nsophisticated diner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.\nWe will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,\nasking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their\ne-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed at\nloomisbrk@gmail. com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at Berkshire Questions@cnbc. com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of\nthe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes. com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most\ninteresting and important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being\nselected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no\nmore than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like\nyour name mentioned if your question is asked.)\nAn accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\ninsurance specialist will be Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will\ncome from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Since what we\nwill be conducting is a shareholders’ meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that\nadd to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be\ntough, for sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many\nquestioners as possible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than\nwhen you came and for you to have a good time while in Omaha.\nAll told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and\nfor 18 from the audience. The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will\ntake place at 8: 15 a. m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena\nand main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.\n\n[[PAGE_BREAK]]",

    "content": "While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I\nbelieve all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if\npossible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we\ntry to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a\nSaturday (a day that also eases traffic and parking problems).\nWe do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or\nanalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the\nshareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the company\nday-to-day – and as I write this letter – that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly\nAll-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the\nmindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned\ncompanies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means\nas much to them as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\nteam efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,450-page Federal\nincome tax return, oversees the filing of 3,580 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media\ninquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s\nactivities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt\nwith the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me.\nThey also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French\nfries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help Carrie Sova –\nour talented ringmaster at the annual meeting – deliver an interesting and entertaining weekend for our\nshareholders. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them.\nI’m a lucky guy, very fortunate in being surrounded by this excellent staff, a team of highly-talented\noperating managers and a boardroom of very wise and experienced directors. Come to Omaha – the cradle of\ncapitalism – on May 6 th and meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look forward to seeing you.\nFebruary 25,2017 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board",
