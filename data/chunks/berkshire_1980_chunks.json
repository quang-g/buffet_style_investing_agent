Normally, an\ninterest of this magnitude (over 20%) would qualify as an\ninvestee holding and would require us to reflect a\nproportionate share of GEICOs earnings in our own. However, we\npurchased our GEICO stock pursuant to special orders of the\nDistrict of Columbia and New York Insurance Departments, which\nrequired that the right to vote the stock be placed with an\nindependent party. Absent the vote, our 33% interest does not\nqualify for investee treatment. (Pinkertons is a similar\nsituation.)\n\nOf course, whether or not the undistributed earnings of\nGEICO are picked up annually in our operating earnings figure has\nnothing to do with their economic value to us, or to you as\nowners of Berkshire. The value of these retained earnings will\nbe determined by the skill with which they are put to use by\nGEICO management.\n\nOn this score, we simply couldnt feel better. GEICO\nrepresents the best of all investment worlds - the coupling of a\nvery important and very hard to duplicate business advantage with\nan extraordinary management whose skills in operations are\nmatched by skills in capital allocation.\n\nAs you can see, our holdings cost us $47 million, with about\nhalf of this amount invested in 1976 and most of the remainder\ninvested in 1980.

    "chunk_text": "Insurance Industry Conditions\n\nBut the full implications flowing from massive unrealized\nbond losses are far more serious than just the immobilization of\ninvestment intellect. For the source of funds to purchase\nand\nhold\nthose bonds is a pool of money derived from policyholders\nand claimants (with changing faces) - money which, in effect, is\ntemporarily on deposit with the insurer. As long as this pool\nretains its size, no bonds must be sold. If the pool of funds\nshrinks - which it will if the volume of business declines\nsignificantly - assets must be sold to pay off the liabilities.\nAnd if those assets consist of bonds with big unrealized losses,\nsuch losses will rapidly become realized, decimating net worth in\nthe process.\n\nThus, an insurance company with a bond market value\nshrinkage approaching stated net worth (of which there are now\nmany) and also faced with inadequate rate levels that are sure to\ndeteriorate further has two options. One option for management\nis to tell the underwriters to keep pricing according to the\nexposure involved - be sure to get a dollar of premium for every\ndollar of expense cost plus expectable loss cost.\n\nThe consequences of this directive are predictable: (a) with\nmost business both price sensitive and renewable annually, many\npolicies presently on the books will be lost to competitors in\nrather short order; (b) as premium volume shrinks significantly,\nthere will be a lagged but corresponding decrease in liabilities\n(unearned premiums and claims payable); (c) assets (bonds) must\nbe sold to match the decrease in liabilities; and (d) the\nformerly unrecognized disappearance of net worth will become\npartially recognized (depending upon the extent of such sales) in\nthe insurers published financial statements.\n\nVariations of this depressing sequence involve a smaller\npenalty to stated net worth. The reaction of some companies at\n(c) would be to sell either stocks that are already carried at\nmarket values or recently purchased bonds involving less severe\nlosses. This ostrich-like behavior - selling the better assets\nand keeping the biggest losers - while less painful in the short\nterm, is unlikely to be a winner in the long term.\n\nThe second option is much simpler: just keep writing\nbusiness regardless of rate levels and whopping prospective\nunderwriting losses, thereby maintaining the present levels of\npremiums, assets and liabilities - and then pray for a better\nday, either for underwriting or for bond prices. There is much\ncriticism in the trade press of cash flow underwriting; i. e.,\nwriting business regardless of prospective underwriting losses in\norder to obtain funds to invest at current high interest rates.\nThis second option might properly be termed asset maintenance\nunderwriting - the acceptance of terrible business just to keep\nthe assets you now have.\n\nOf course you know which option will be selected. And it\nalso is clear that as long as many large insurers feel compelled\nto choose that second option, there will be no better day for\nunderwriting. For if much of the industry feels it must maintain\npremium volume levels regardless of price adequacy, all insurers\nwill have to come close to meeting those prices.

    "content": "Insurance Industry Conditions\n\nBut the full implications flowing from massive unrealized\nbond losses are far more serious than just the immobilization of\ninvestment intellect. For the source of funds to purchase\nand\nhold\nthose bonds is a pool of money derived from policyholders\nand claimants (with changing faces) - money which, in effect, is\ntemporarily on deposit with the insurer. As long as this pool\nretains its size, no bonds must be sold. If the pool of funds\nshrinks - which it will if the volume of business declines\nsignificantly - assets must be sold to pay off the liabilities.\nAnd if those assets consist of bonds with big unrealized losses,\nsuch losses will rapidly become realized, decimating net worth in\nthe process.\n\nThus, an insurance company with a bond market value\nshrinkage approaching stated net worth (of which there are now\nmany) and also faced with inadequate rate levels that are sure to\ndeteriorate further has two options. One option for management\nis to tell the underwriters to keep pricing according to the\nexposure involved - be sure to get a dollar of premium for every\ndollar of expense cost plus expectable loss cost.\n\nThe consequences of this directive are predictable: (a) with\nmost business both price sensitive and renewable annually, many\npolicies presently on the books will be lost to competitors in\nrather short order; (b) as premium volume shrinks significantly,\nthere will be a lagged but corresponding decrease in liabilities\n(unearned premiums and claims payable); (c) assets (bonds) must\nbe sold to match the decrease in liabilities; and (d) the\nformerly unrecognized disappearance of net worth will become\npartially recognized (depending upon the extent of such sales) in\nthe insurers published financial statements.\n\nVariations of this depressing sequence involve a smaller\npenalty to stated net worth. The reaction of some companies at\n(c) would be to sell either stocks that are already carried at\nmarket values or recently purchased bonds involving less severe\nlosses. This ostrich-like behavior - selling the better assets\nand keeping the biggest losers - while less painful in the short\nterm, is unlikely to be a winner in the long term.\n\nThe second option is much simpler: just keep writing\nbusiness regardless of rate levels and whopping prospective\nunderwriting losses, thereby maintaining the present levels of\npremiums, assets and liabilities - and then pray for a better\nday, either for underwriting or for bond prices. There is much\ncriticism in the trade press of cash flow underwriting; i. e.,\nwriting business regardless of prospective underwriting losses in\norder to obtain funds to invest at current high interest rates.\nThis second option might properly be termed asset maintenance\nunderwriting - the acceptance of terrible business just to keep\nthe assets you now have.\n\nOf course you know which option will be selected. And it\nalso is clear that as long as many large insurers feel compelled\nto choose that second option, there will be no better day for\nunderwriting. For if much of the industry feels it must maintain\npremium volume levels regardless of price adequacy, all insurers\nwill have to come close to meeting those prices. Right behind\nhaving financial problems yourself, the next worst plight is to\nhave a large group of competitors with financial problems that\nthey can defer by a sell-at-any-price policy.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that companies that were unwilling -\nfor any of a number of reasons, including public reaction,\ninstitutional pride, or protection of stated net worth - to sell\nbonds at price levels forcing recognition of major losses might\nfind themselves frozen in investment posture for a decade or\nlonger.
