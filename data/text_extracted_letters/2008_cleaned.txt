Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results

The table on the preceding page, recording both the 44-year performance of Berkshire’s book value
and the S&P 500 index, shows that 2008 was the worst year for each. The period was devastating as well for
corporate and municipal bonds, real estate and commodities. By yearend, investors of all stripes were bloodied

Astheyearprogressed,aseriesoflife-threateningproblemswithinmanyoftheworld’sgreatfinancial

and the Fed have gone “all in.” Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recently
been dispensed by the barrel. These once-unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcome
aftereffects. Their precise nature is anyone’s guess, though one likely consequence is an onslaught of inflation.
Moreover, major industries have become dependent on Federal assistance, and they will be followed by cities
and states bearing mind-boggling requests. Weaning these entities from the public teat will be a political
challenge.Theywon’tleavewillingly.

Without fail, however, we’ve overcome them. In the face of those obstacles – and many others – the

Take a look again at the 44-year table on page 2. In 75% of those years, the S&P stocks recorded a

Munger, my partner in running Berkshire, nor I can predict the winning and losing years in advance. (In our

businessesearnedsubstantialsumsandmostofthem–particularly thelargerones–continuetostrengthentheir

insurance and utility groups – produce earnings that are not correlated to those of the general economy. Both
businessesdeliveredoutstandingresultsin2008andhaveexcellentprospects.
As predicted in last year’s report, the exceptional underwriting profits that our insurance businesses
realizedin2007werenotrepeatedin2008.Nevertheless,theinsurancegroupdeliveredanunderwritinggainfor
thesixthconsecutiveyear.Thismeansthatour$58.5billionofinsurance“float”–moneythatdoesn’tbelongto
us but that we hold and invest for our own benefit – cost us less than zero. In fact, wewere paid $2.8billion to
holdourfloatduring2008.CharlieandIfindthisenjoyable.
Over time, most insurers experience a substantial underwriting loss, which makes their economics far
different from ours. Of course, we too will experience underwriting losses in some years. But we have the best
groupofmanagersintheinsurancebusiness,andinmostcasestheyoverseeentrenchedandvaluablefranchises.
Considering these strengths, I believe that we will earn an underwriting profit over the years and that our float
will therefore cost us nothing. Our insurance operation, the core business of Berkshire, is an economic
powerhouse.
Charlie and I are equally enthusiastic about our utility business, which had record earnings last year
and is poised for future gains. Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the managers of this operation, have achieved results
unmatched elsewhere in the utility industry. I love it when they come up with new projects because in this
capital-intensive businesstheseventuresareoftenlarge.SuchprojectsofferBerkshiretheopportunitytoputout

Things also went well on the capital-allocation front last year. Berkshire is always a buyer of both
businesses and securities, and the disarray in markets gave us a tailwind in our purchases. When investing,
pessimismisyourfriend,euphoriatheenemy.
In our insurance portfolios, we made three large investments on terms that would be unavailable in
normal markets. These should add about $11⁄ 2 billion pre-tax to Berkshire’s annual earnings and offer
possibilities for capital gains as well. We also closed on our Marmon acquisition (we own 64% of the company
nowandwillpurchaseitsremainingstockoverthenextsixyears).Additionally,certainofoursubsidiariesmade

you more about these later. Furthermore, I made some errors of omission, sucking my thumb when new facts

Additionally, the market value of the bonds and stocks that we continue to hold suffered a significant
declinealongwiththegeneralmarket.ThisdoesnotbotherCharlieandme.Indeed,weenjoysuchpricedeclines

Yardsticks
Berkshire has two major areas of value. The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash
equivalents. At yearend those totaled $122 billion (not counting the investments held by our finance and utility
operations, which we assign to our second bucket of value). About $58.5 billion of that total is funded by our
insurancefloat.

our insurance earnings from this calculation because the value of our insurance operation comes from the

RegulatedUtilityBusiness
Berkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide
variety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose
3.8 million end users make it the U.K.’s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which
serves 723,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving
about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines,
whichcarryabout9%ofthenaturalgasconsumedintheU.S.
Our partners in ownership of MidAmerican are its two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel,
and my long-time friend, Walter Scott. It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we make major moves
only when we are unanimous in thinking them wise. Nine years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have
reinforcedmyoriginalbelief:Berkshirecouldn’thavebetterpartners.
Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican alsoownsthesecondlargest real estate brokerage firm inthe
U.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000
agents. Last year was a terrible year for home sales, and 2009 looks no better. We will continue, however, to

Ourlong-avowedgoalistobethe“buyerofchoice”forbusinesses–particularlythosebuiltandowned
by families. The way to achieve this goal is to deserve it. That means we must keep our promises; avoid
leveraging upacquired businesses; grant unusual autonomy to our managers; and hold the purchased companies
throughthickandthin(thoughwepreferthickandthicker).
Our record matches our rhetoric. Most buyers competing against us, however, follow a different path.
For them, acquisitions are “merchandise.” Before the ink dries on their purchase contracts, these operators are
contemplating “exit strategies.” We have a decided advantage, therefore, when we encounter sellers who truly
careaboutthefutureoftheirbusinesses.
Some years back our competitors were known as “leveraged-buyout operators.” But LBO became a
badname.SoinOrwellianfashion,thebuyoutfirmsdecidedtochangetheirmoniker.Whattheydidnotchange,
though, were the essential ingredients of their previous operations, including their cherished fee structures and
loveofleverage.
Their new label became “private equity,” a name that turns the facts upside-down: A purchase of a
business by these firms almost invariably results in dramatic reductions in the equity portion of the acquiree’s
capital structure compared tothatpreviously existing. Anumberoftheseacquirees,purchasedonlytwotothree
years ago, are now in mortal danger because of the debt piled on them by their private-equity buyers. Much of

they’rekeepingtheirremainingfundsveryprivate.
In the regulated utility field there are no large family-owned businesses. Here, Berkshire hopes to be
the “buyer of choice” of regulators. It is they, rather than selling shareholders, who judge the fitness of
purchaserswhentransactionsareproposed.

At GEICO, Tony Nicely – now in his 48th year at the company after joining it when he was 18 –

has moved GEICO into the number three position among auto insurers. In 1995, when Berkshire purchased

General Re, our large international reinsurer, also had an outstanding year in 2008. Some time back,
thecompanyhadseriousproblems(whichItotallyfailedtodetectwhenwepurchaseditinlate1998).By2001,
when Joe Brandon took over as CEO, assisted by his partner, Tad Montross, General Re’s culture had further
deteriorated, exhibiting a loss of discipline in underwriting, reserving and expenses. After Joe and Tad took
charge, these problems were decisively and successfully addressed. Today General Re has regained its luster.
Last spring Joe stepped down, and Tad became CEO. Charlie and I are grateful to Joe for righting the ship and
arecertainthat,withTad,GeneralRe’sfutureisinthebestofhands.

Reinsurance is a business of long-term promises, sometimes extending for fifty years or more. This
past year has retaught clients a crucial principle: A promise is nobetter than the person or institution making it.
That’swhereGeneralReexcels:ItistheonlyreinsurerthatisbackedbyanAAAcorporation.BenFranklinonce

Our smaller insurers are just as outstanding in their own way as the “big three,” regularly delivering

This motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned an impressive
17.9% on average tangible net worth last year. It’s also noteworthy that these operations used only minor
financial leverage in achieving that return. Clearly we own some terrific businesses. We purchased many of
them, however, at large premiums to net worth – a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on our balance

At that time, much of the industry employed sales practices that were atrocious. Writing about the
period somewhat later, I described it as involving “borrowers who shouldn’t have borrowed being financed by
lenderswhoshouldn’thavelent.”

borrowers who signed up because they had nothing to lose. The resulting mortgages were usually packaged

Clayton, it should be emphasized, followed far more sensible practices in its own lending throughout
that time. Indeed, no purchaser of the mortgages it originated and then securitized has ever lost a dime of
principalorinterest.ButClaytonwastheexception;industrylosseswerestaggering.Andthehangovercontinues
tothisday.
This 1997-2000 fiasco should have served as a canary-in-the-coal-mine warning for the far-larger
conventional housing market. But investors, government and rating agencies learned exactly nothing from the
manufactured-home debacle. Instead, in an eerie rerun of that disaster, the same mistakes were repeated with
conventionalhomesinthe2004-07period:Lendershappilymadeloansthatborrowerscouldn’trepayoutoftheir
incomes, and borrowers just as happily signed uptomeet thosepayments. Bothparties countedon“house-price
appreciation” to make this otherwise impossible arrangement work. It was Scarlett O’Hara all over again: “I’ll
think about it tomorrow.” The consequences of this behavior are now reverberating through every corner of our
economy.
Clayton’s 198,888 borrowers, however, have continued to pay normally throughout the housing crash,
handingusnounexpectedlosses.Thisisnotbecausetheseborrowersareunusuallycreditworthy,apointproved
by FICO scores (a standard measure of credit risk). Their median FICO score is 644, compared to a national
median of 723, and about 35% are below 620, the segment usually designated “sub-prime.” Many disastrous
pools of mortgages on conventional homes are populated by borrowers with far better credit, as measured by
FICOscores.
Yet at yearend, our delinquency rate on loans we have originated was 3.6%, up only modestly from
2.9%in2006and2.9%in2004.(Inadditiontoouroriginatedloans,we’vealsoboughtbulkportfoliosofvarious

Commentary about the current housing crisis often ignores the crucial fact that most foreclosures do
not occur because a house is worth less than its mortgage (so-called “upside-down” loans). Rather, foreclosures
take place because borrowers can’t pay the monthly payment that they agreed to pay. Homeowners who have
made a meaningful down-payment – derived from savings and not from other borrowing – seldom walk away
fromaprimaryresidencesimplybecauseitsvaluetodayislessthanthemortgage.Instead,theywalkwhenthey

Home ownership is a wonderful thing. My family and I have enjoyed my present home for 50 years,

Thepresent housingdebacle shouldteach homebuyers,lenders, brokers andgovernmentsomesimple
lessons that will ensure stability in the future. Home purchases should involve an honest-to-God down payment

Clayton’s lending operation, though not damaged by the performance of its borrowers, is nevertheless
threatened by an element of the credit crisis. Funders that have access to any sort of government guarantee –
bankswithFDIC-insureddeposits,largeentitieswithcommercialpapernowbackedbytheFederalReserve,and
others whoare using imaginative methods (or lobbying skills) to come under the government’s umbrella –have
money costs that are minimal. Conversely, highly-rated companies, such as Berkshire, are experiencing
borrowing costs that, in relation to Treasury rates, are at record levels. Moreover, funds are abundant for the

Tax-ExemptBondInsurance
Early in 2008, we activated Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Company (“BHAC”) as an insurer of the
tax-exempt bonds issued by states, cities and other local entities. BHACinsures these securities for issuers both
atthetimetheirbondsaresoldtothepublic(primary transactions) andlater,whenthebondsarealreadyowned
byinvestors(secondarytransactions).
By yearend 2007, the half dozen or so companies that had been the major players in this business had
allfallenintobigtrouble.ThecauseoftheirproblemswascapturedlongagobyMaeWest:“IwasSnowWhite,
butIdrifted.”
The monolines (as the bond insurers are called) initially insured only tax-exempt bonds that were
low-risk. But over the years competition for this business intensified, and rates fell. Faced with the prospect of
stagnating or declining earnings, the monoline managers turned to ever-riskier propositions. Some of these
involved the insuring of residential mortgage obligations. When housing prices plummeted, the monoline
industryquicklybecameabasketcase.
Early in the year, Berkshire offered to assume all of the insurance issued on tax-exempts that was on
the books of the three largest monolines. These companies were all in life-threatening trouble (though they said
otherwise.) We would have charged a 11⁄ 2% rate to take over the guarantees on about $822 billion of bonds. If
our offer had been accepted, we would have been required to pay any losses suffered by investors who owned
these bonds – a guarantee stretching for 40 years in some cases. Ours was not a frivolous proposal: For reasons
wewillcometolater,itinvolvedsubstantialriskforBerkshire.
The monolines summarily rejected our offer, in some cases appending an insult or two. In the end,
though, the turndowns proved to be very good news for us, because it became apparent that I had severely
underpricedouroffer.
Thereafter, we wrote about $15.6 billion of insurance in the secondary market. And here’s the punch
line: About 77% of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by the three aforementioned
monolines.Intheseagreements,wehavetopayfordefaultsonlyiftheoriginalinsurerisfinanciallyunabletodo
so.
Wewrotethis“second-to-pay”insuranceforratesaveraging3.3%.That’sright;wehavebeenpaidfar
more for becoming the second to pay than the 1.5% wewouldhaveearlier chargedtobethefirst topay.Inone
extreme case, we actually agreed to be fourth to pay, nonetheless receiving about three times the 1% premium
charged by the monoline that remains first to pay. In other words, three other monolines have to first go broke
beforeweneedtowriteacheck.
Two of the three monolines to which we made our initial bulk offer later raised substantial capital.
This, of course, directly helps us, since it makes it less likely that we will have to pay, at least in the near term,
any claims on our second-to-pay insurance because these two monolines fail. In addition to our book of
secondary business, we have also written $3.7 billion of primary business for a premium of $96 million. In
primarybusiness,ofcourse,wearefirsttopayiftheissuergetsintrouble.
We have a great many more multiples of capital behind the insurance we write than does any other
monoline. Consequently, our guarantee is far more valuable than theirs. This explains why many sophisticated
investors have bought second-to-pay insurance from us even though they were already insured by another
monoline.BHAChasbecomenotonlytheinsurerofpreference,butinmanycasesthesoleinsureracceptableto

Nevertheless, we remain very cautious about the business we write and regard it as far from a sure

The rationale behind very low premium rates for insuring tax-exempts has been that defaults have
historically been few. But that record largely reflects the experience of entities that issued uninsured bonds.
Insuranceoftax-exemptbondsdidn’texistbefore1971,andevenafterthatmostbondsremaineduninsured.
A universe of tax-exempts fully covered by insurance would be certain to have a somewhat different
loss experience from a group of uninsured, but otherwise similar bonds, the only question being how different.
To understand why, let’s go back to 1975 when New York City was on the edge of bankruptcy. At the time its
bonds – virtually all uninsured – were heavily held by the city’s wealthier residents as well as by New York
banksandotherinstitutions.Theselocalbondholdersdeeplydesiredtosolvethecity’sfiscalproblems.Sobefore
long, concessions and cooperation from a host of involved constituencies produced a solution. Without one, it
was apparent to all that New York’s citizens and businesses would have experienced widespread and severe
financiallossesfromtheirbondholdings.
Now, imagine that all of the city’s bonds had instead been insured by Berkshire. Would similar belttightening,taxincreases,laborconcessions,etc.havebeenforthcoming?Ofcoursenot.Ataminimum,Berkshire
would have been asked to “share” in the required sacrifices. And, considering our deep pockets, the required
contributionwouldmostcertainlyhavebeensubstantial.
Local governments are going to face far tougher fiscal problems in the future than they have to date.
The pension liabilities I talked about in last year’s report will be a huge contributor to these woes. Many cities
andstatesweresurelyhorrifiedwhentheyinspectedthestatusoftheirfundingatyearend2008.Thegapbetween
assetsandarealisticactuarialvaluationofpresentliabilitiesissimplystaggering.
When faced with large revenue shortfalls, communities that have all of their bonds insured will be
more prone to develop “solutions” less favorable to bondholders than those communities that have uninsured
bonds held by local banks and residents. Losses in the tax-exempt arena, when they come, are also likely to be
highly correlated among issuers. If a few communities stiff their creditors and get away with it, the chance that
others will follow in their footsteps will grow. What mayor or city council is going to choose pain to local
citizensintheformofmajortaxincreasesoverpaintoafar-awaybondinsurer?
Insuring tax-exempts, therefore, has the look today of a dangerous business – one with similarities, in
fact, to the insuring of natural catastrophes. In both cases, a string of loss-free years can be followed by a
devastatingexperiencethatmorethanwipesoutallearlierprofits.Wewilltry,therefore,toproceedcarefullyin

Thetypeoffallacyinvolvedinprojectinglossexperiencefromauniverseofnon-insuredbondsontoa
deceptively-similar universe in which many bonds are insured pops up in other areas of finance. “Back-tested”
models of many kinds are susceptible to this sort of error. Nevertheless, they are frequently touted in financial
marketsasguidestofutureaction.(Ifmerelylookinguppastfinancialdatawouldtellyouwhatthefutureholds,
theForbes400wouldconsistoflibrarians.)
Indeed, the stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed,
history-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors. These parties looked at loss experience
over periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses wasnegligible. Theythen made
this experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had
recentlyskyrocketed,loanpracticeshaddeterioratedandmanybuyershadoptedforhousestheycouldn’tafford.
In short, universe “past” and universe “current” had very different characteristics. But lenders, government and
medialargelyfailedtorecognizethisall-importantfact.

[[PAGE_BREAK]]

Investors should be skeptical of history-based models. Constructed by a nerdy-sounding priesthood
using esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the like, these models tend to look impressive. Too often,
though, investors forget to examine the assumptions behind the symbols. Our advice: Beware of geeks bearing
formulas.
************
A final post-script on BHAC: Who, you may wonder, runs this operation? While I help set policy, all
of the heavy lifting is done by Ajit and his crew. Sure, they were already generating $24 billion of float along
with hundreds of millions of underwriting profit annually. But how busy can that keep a 31-person group?

In addition, we have holdings in Moody’s and Burlington Northern Santa Fe that we now carry at
“equity value” – our cost plus retained earnings since our purchase, minus the tax that would be paid if those
earnings were paid to us as dividends. This accounting treatment is usually required when ownership of an
investeecompanyreaches20%.
We purchased 15% of Moody’s some years ago and have not since bought a share. Moody’s, though,
has repurchased its own shares and, by late 2008, those repurchases reduced its outstanding shares to the point
that our holdings rose above 20%. Burlington Northern has also repurchased shares, but our increase to 20%

On the plus side last year, we made purchases totaling $14.5 billion in fixed-income securities issued
by Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. We very much like these commitments, which carry high
current yields that, in themselves, make the investments more than satisfactory. But in each of these three

Berkshire with more than ample cash. We never want to count on the kindness of strangers in order to meet
tomorrow’s obligations. When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra
profits.
The investment world has gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it. This change has not been
minor; the pendulum has covered an extraordinary arc. A few years ago, it wouldhave seemed unthinkable that
yields like today’s could have been obtained on good-grade municipal or corporate bonds even while risk-free
governmentsofferednear-zeroreturnsonshort-termbondsandnobetterthanapittanceonlong-terms.Whenthe
financial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the
housing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost
equallyextraordinary.
Clinging to cash equivalents or long-term government bonds at present yields is almost certainly a
terriblepolicyifcontinuedforlong.Holdersoftheseinstruments,ofcourse,havefeltincreasinglycomfortable–
in fact, almost smug – in following this policy as financial turmoil has mounted. They regard their judgment
confirmed when they hear commentators proclaim “cash is king,” even though that wonderful cash is earning

Approval, though, is not the goal of investing. In fact, approval is often counter-productive because it
sedates the brain and makes it less receptive to new facts or a re-examination of conclusions formed earlier.

For a case study on regulatory effectiveness, let’s look harder at the Freddie and Fannie example.
These giant institutions were created by Congress, which retained control over them, dictating what they could
and could not do. To aid its oversight, Congress created OFHEO in 1992, admonishing it to make sure the two
behemoths werebehavingthemselves. Withthat move,FannieandFreddiebecamethemostintensely-regulated

On June 15,2003,OFHEO(whose annual reports are available onthe Internet) sent its 2002report to
Congress–specificallytoitsfourbossesintheSenateandHouse,amongthemnoneotherthanMessrs.Sarbanes
and Oxley. The report’s 127 pages included a self-congratulatory cover-line: “Celebrating 10 Years of
Excellence.” The transmittal letter and report were delivered nine days after the CEO and CFO of Freddie had
resigned in disgrace and the COO had been fired. No mention of their departures was made in the letter, even
whilethereportconcluded,asitalwaysdid,that“BothEnterpriseswerefinanciallysoundandwellmanaged.”
In truth, both enterprises had engaged in massive accounting shenanigans for some time. Finally, in

A normal stock or bond trade is completed in a few days with one party getting its cash, the other its
securities. Counterparty risk therefore quickly disappears, which means credit problems can’t accumulate. This
rapid settlement process is key to maintaining the integrity of markets. That, in fact, is a reason for NYSE and
NASDAQshorteningthesettlementperiodfromfivedaystothreedaysin1995.
Derivatives contracts, in contrast, often go unsettled for years, or even decades, with counterparties
building up huge claims against each other. “Paper” assets and liabilities – often hard to quantify – become
important parts of financial statements though these items will not be validated for many years. Additionally, a
frightening webof mutual dependence develops among huge financial institutions. Receivables and payables by

myfault.
Our derivatives dealings require our counterparties to make payments to us when contracts are
initiated. Berkshire therefore always holds the money, which leaves us assuming no meaningful counterparty
risk. As of yearend, the payments made to us less losses we have paid – our derivatives “float,” so to speak –
totaled$8.1billion.Thisfloatissimilartoinsurancefloat:Ifwebreakevenonanunderlyingtransaction,wewill

Only a small percentage of our contracts call for any posting of collateral when the market moves
againstus.Evenunderthechaoticconditionsexistinginlastyear’sfourthquarter,wehadtopostlessthan1%of
our securities portfolio. (When we post collateral, we deposit it with third parties, meanwhile retaining the
investment earnings on the deposited securities.) In our 2002 annual report, we warned of the lethal threat that
posting requirements create, real-life illustrations of which we witnessed last year at a variety of financial
institutions (and, for that matter, at Constellation Energy, which was within hours of bankruptcy when
MidAmericanarrivedtoeffectarescue).
Our contracts fall into four major categories. With apologies to those who are not fascinated by
financialinstruments,Iwillexplaintheminexcruciatingdetail.
• Wehaveaddedmodestlytothe“equityput”portfolioIdescribedinlastyear’sreport.Someofour
contracts come due in 15 years, others in 20. We must make a payment to our counterparty at
maturityifthereferenceindextowhichtheputistiedisthenbelowwhatitwasattheinceptionof

the meantime, the sale of the put would have delivered us a premium – perhaps $100 million to
$150million–thatwewouldbefreetoinvestaswewish.
Our put contracts total $37.1 billion (at current exchange rates) and are spread among four major
indices: the S&P500in the U.S.,the FTSE100in the U.K.,the Euro Stoxx 50in Europe,andthe
Nikkei225inJapan.OurfirstcontractcomesdueonSeptember9,2019andourlastonJanuary24,
2028.We have received premiums of $4.9billion, moneywehaveinvested. We,meanwhile, have
paid nothing, since all expiration dates are far in the future. Nonetheless, we have used BlackScholes valuation methods to record a yearend liability of $10 billion, an amount that will change
oneveryreportingdate.Thetwofinancialitems–thisestimatedlossof$10billionminusthe$4.9
billion in premiums we have received – means that we have so far reported a mark-to-market loss
of$5.1billionfromthesecontracts.

[[PAGE_BREAK]]

We endorse mark-to-market accounting. I will explain later, however, why I believe the BlackScholes formula, even though it is the standard for establishing the dollar liability for options,
producesstrangeresultswhenthelong-termvarietyarebeingvalued.
Onepointaboutourcontractsthatissometimesnotunderstood:Forustolosethefull$37.1billion

contract, and foreign-exchange rates remained as they are today, we would owe about $9 billion,
payable between 2019 and 2028. Between the inception of the contract and those dates, we would
haveheldthe$4.9billionpremiumandearnedinvestmentincomeonit.
• The second category we described in last year’s report concerns derivatives requiring us to pay
whencreditlossesoccuratcompaniesthatareincludedinvarioushigh-yieldindices.Ourstandard
contractcoversafive-yearperiodandinvolves100companies.Wemodestlyexpandedourposition
last year in this category. But, of course, the contracts on the books at the end of 2007 moved one
yearclosertotheirmaturity.Overall,ourcontractsnowhaveanaveragelifeof21⁄ 3years,withthe
firstexpirationduetooccuronSeptember20,2009andthelastonDecember20,2013.
By yearend we had received premiums of $3.4 billion on these contracts and paid losses of $542
million.Usingmark-to-market principles,wealsosetupaliabilityforfuturelossesthatatyearend
totaled $3.0 billion. Thus wehad to that point recorded a loss of about $100million, derived from
our $3.5 billion total in paid and estimated future losses minus the $3.4 billion of premiums we
received. In our quarterly reports, however, the amount of gain or loss has swung wildly from a
profitof$327millioninthesecondquarterof2008toalossof$693millioninthefourthquarterof
2008.
Surprisingly, we made payments on these contracts of only $97 million last year, far below the
estimate I used when I decided to enter into them. This year, however, losses have accelerated
sharplywiththemushroomingoflargebankruptcies.Inlastyear’sletter,ItoldyouIexpectedthese
contracts to show a profit at expiration. Now, with the recession deepening at a rapid rate, the
possibilityofaneventuallosshasincreased.Whatevertheresult,Iwillkeepyouposted.
• In 2008 we began to write “credit default swaps” on individual companies. This is simply credit
insurance, similar to what we write in BHAC, except that here we bear the credit risk of
corporationsratherthanoftax-exemptissuers.
If, say, the XYZ company goes bankrupt, and we have written a $100 million contract, we are
obligated to pay an amount that reflects the shrinkage in value of a comparable amount of XYZ’s
debt. (If, for example, the company’s bonds are selling for 30 after default, we would owe $70
million.) For the typical contract, we receive quarterly payments for five years, after which our
insuranceexpires.
At yearend we had written $4 billion of contracts covering 42 corporations, for which we receive
annual premiums of $93 million. This is the only derivatives business we write that has any
counterpartyrisk;thepartythatbuysthecontractfromusmustbegoodforthequarterlypremiums
it will owe us over the five years. We are unlikely to expand this business to any extent because
most buyers of this protection now insist that the seller post collateral, and we will not enter into
suchanarrangement.
• At the request of our customers, we write a few tax-exempt bond insurance contracts that are
similar to those written at BHAC, but that are structured as derivatives. The only meaningful
difference between the two contracts is that mark-to-market accounting is required for derivatives
whereasstandardaccrualaccountingisrequiredatBHAC.

[[PAGE_BREAK]]

But this difference can produce some strange results. The bonds covered – in effect, insured – by
thesederivativesarelargelygeneralobligationsofstates,andwefeelgoodaboutthem.Atyearend,
however, mark-to-market accounting required us to record a loss of $631 million on these
derivativescontracts.HadweinsteadinsuredthesamebondsatthesamepriceinBHAC,andused
theaccrualaccountingrequiredatinsurancecompanies,wewouldhaverecordedasmallprofitfor
the year. The two methods by which we insure the bonds will eventually produce the same
accountingresult.Intheshortterm,however,thevarianceinreportedprofitscanbesubstantial.
We have told you before that our derivative contracts, subject as they are to mark-to-market
accounting, will produce wild swings in the earnings we report. The ups and downs neither cheer nor bother
Charlie and me. Indeed, the “downs” can be helpful in that they give us an opportunity to expand a position on
favorableterms.Ihopethisexplanationofourdealingswillleadyoutothinksimilarly.

The Black-Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance, and we use it when
valuingourequityputoptionsforfinancialstatementpurposes.Keyinputstothecalculationincludeacontract’s
maturityandstrikeprice,aswellastheanalyst’sexpectationsforvolatility,interestratesanddividends.
If the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness,
Black and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoring
whatevercaveatsthetwomenattachedwhentheyfirstunveiledtheformula.
It’softenusefulintestingatheorytopushittoextremes.Solet’spostulatethatwesella100-year$1
billion put option on the S&P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied
volatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest and
dividendassumptions,wewouldfindthe“proper”Black-Scholespremiumforthiscontracttobe$2.5million.
To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&Pwill be valued a century
from nowat lessthantoday.Certainly thedollar willthenbeworthasmall fraction ofitspresent value(atonly
2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher.
Far more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value of
most of the companies in the index. In the 20th Century, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about
175-fold,mainlybecauseofthisretained-earningsfactor.
Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year
periodtobefarless than1%.Butlet’s usethat figureandalsoassumethatthemostlikelydecline–shouldone
occur – is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5
million($1billionX1%X50%).
But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to
invest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have
beenprofit.Wouldyouliketoborrowmoneyfor100yearsata0.7%rate?
Let’slookatmyexamplefromaworst-casestandpoint.Rememberthat99%ofthetimewewouldpay
nothingifmyassumptionsarecorrect.Butevenintheworstcaseamongtheremaining1%ofpossibilities–that
is, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion – our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my
assumptionsarecrazyortheformulaisinappropriate.

[[PAGE_BREAK]]

Theridiculous premium that Black-Scholesdictates inmyextremeexampleiscausedbytheinclusion
of volatility in the formula andbythefact thatvolatility isdetermined byhowmuchstockshavemovedaround
in some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probabilityweightedrangeofvaluesofAmericanbusiness100yearsfromnow.(Imagine,ifyouwill,gettingaquoteevery
day on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing
quotesasanimportantingredientinanequationthatpredictsaprobability-weightedrangeofvaluesforthefarm

Thoughhistoricalvolatilityisauseful–butfarfromfoolproof–conceptinvaluingshort-termoptions,
itsutilitydiminishesrapidlyasthedurationoftheoptionlengthens.Inmyopinion,thevaluationsthattheBlackScholes formula now place on our long-term put options overstate our liability, though the overstatement will
diminishasthecontractsapproachmaturity.
Even so, we will continue to use Black-Scholes when we are estimating our financial-statement
liability for long-term equity puts. The formula represents conventional wisdom and any substitute that I might
offer would engender extreme skepticism. That would be perfectly understandable: CEOs who have concocted
their own valuations for esoteric financial instruments have seldom erred onthe side of conservatism. That club
ofoptimistsisonethatCharlieandIhavenodesiretojoin.
