Most of this growth resulted from our\nmerger with Blue Chip Stamps, but there also was an acceleration\nin the pace of natural increase that has raised us from the\n1000 level a few years ago.\n\nWith so many new shareholders, its appropriate to summarize\nthe major business principles we follow that pertain to the\nmanager-owner relationship:\n\no\nAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is\npartnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as\nowner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because\nof the size of our shareholdings we also are, for better or\nworse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself\nas the ultimate owner of our business assets but, instead, view\nthe company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the\nassets.\n\no\nIn line with this owner-orientation, our directors are all\nmajor shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. In the case of at\nleast four of the five, over 50% of family net worth is\nrepresented by holdings of Berkshire. We eat our own cooking.\n\no\nOur long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications\nmentioned later) is to maximize the average annual rate of gain\nin intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not\nmeasure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by\nits size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that\nthe rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a\ngreatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be\ndisappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average\nlarge American corporation.\n\no\nOur preference would be to reach this goal by directly\nowning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and\nconsistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second\nchoice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily\nthrough purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance\nsubsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the\nneed for insurance capital determine any given years capital\nallocation.\n\no\nBecause of this two-pronged approach to business ownership\nand because of the limitations of conventional accounting,\nconsolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about\nour true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and\nmanagers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However,\nwe will also report to you the earnings of each major business we\ncontrol, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures,\nalong with other information we will supply about the individual\nbusinesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about\nthem.\n\no\nAccounting consequences do not influence our operating or\ncapital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are\nsimilar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not\nreportable by us under standard accounting principles than to\npurchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely\nthe choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose\nearnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the\npro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely\nunreportable). In aggregate and over time, we expect the\nunreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic\nbusiness value through capital gains.\n\no\nWe rarely use much debt and, when we do, we attempt to\nstructure it on a long-term fixed rate basis.

In the\nterms of our analogy, the investment in textile assets resembled\ninvestment in a largely-wasted education.\n\nNow, however, our intrinsic business value considerably\nexceeds book value. There are two major reasons:\n\n(1) Standard accounting principles require that common\nstocks held by our insurance subsidiaries be stated on\nour books at market value, but that other stocks we own\nbe carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nAt the end of 1983, the market value of this latter\ngroup exceeded carrying value by $70 million pre-tax,\nor about $50 million after tax. This excess belongs in\nour intrinsic business value, but is not included in\nthe calculation of book value;\n\n(2) More important, we own several businesses that possess\neconomic Goodwill (which is properly includable in\nintrinsic business value) far larger than the\naccounting Goodwill that is carried on our balance\nsheet and reflected in book value.\n\nGoodwill, both economic and accounting, is an arcane subject\nand requires more explanation than is appropriate here. The\nappendix that follows this letter - Goodwill and its\nAmortization: The Rules and The Realities - explains why\neconomic and accounting Goodwill can, and usually do, differ\nenormously.\n\nYou can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking\nabout Goodwill and its amortization. But students of investment\nand management should understand the nuances of the subject. My\nown thinking has changed drastically from 35 years ago when I was\ntaught to favor tangible assets and to shun businesses whose\nvalue depended largely upon economic Goodwill. This bias caused\nme to make many important business mistakes of omission, although\nrelatively few of commission.\n\nKeynes identified my problem: The difficulty lies not in\nthe new ideas but in escaping from the old ones. My escape was\nlong delayed, in part because most of what I had been taught by\nthe same teacher had been (and continues to be) so\nextraordinarily valuable. Ultimately, business experience,\ndirect and vicarious, produced my present strong preference for\nbusinesses that possess large amounts of enduring Goodwill and\nthat utilize a minimum of tangible assets.\n\nI recommend the Appendix to those who are comfortable with\naccounting terminology and who have an interest in understanding\nthe business aspects of Goodwill. Whether or not you wish to\ntackle the Appendix, you should be aware that Charlie and I\nbelieve that Berkshire possesses very significant economic\nGoodwill value above that reflected in our book value.\n\nSources of Reported Earnings\n\nThe table below shows the sources of Berkshires reported\nearnings. In 1982, Berkshire owned about 60% of Blue Chip Stamps\nwhereas, in 1983, our ownership was 60% throughout the first six\nmonths and 100% thereafter. In turn, Berkshires net interest in\nWesco was 48% during 1982 and the first six months of 1983, and\n80% for the balance of 1983. Because of these changed ownership\npercentages, the first two columns of the table provide the best\nmeasure of underlying business performance.\n\nAll of the significant gains and losses attributable to\nunusual sales of assets by any of the business entities are\naggregated with securities transactions on the line near the\nbottom of the table, and are not included in operating earnings.\n(We regard any annual figure for realized capital gains or losses\nas meaningless, but we regard the aggregate realized and\nunrealized capital gains over a period of years as very\nimportant.) Furthermore, amortization of Goodwill is not charged\nagainst the specific businesses but, for reasons outlined in the\nAppendix, is set forth as a separate item.\n\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes After Tax\n-------------------------------------- ------------------\nTotal Berkshire Share Berkshire Share\n------------------ ------------------ ------------------\n1983 1982 1983 1982 1983 1982\n-------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n(000 s omitt", "char_count": 4051, "word_count": 633, "position_in_letter": 0.20076622915927633, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}
