      "start_anchor": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nYou may remember the wildly upbeat message of last years\nreport: nothing much was in the works but our experience had been\nthat something big popped up occasionally. This carefullycrafted corporate strategy paid off in 1985. Later sections of\nthis report discuss (a) our purchase of a major position in\nCapital Cities/ABC, (b) our acquisition of Scott & Fetzer, (c)\nour entry into a large, extended term participation in the\ninsurance business of Firemans Fund, and (d) our sale of our\nstock in General Foods.\n\nOur gain in net worth during the year was $613.6 million, or\n48.2%. It is fitting that the visit of Halleys Comet coincided\nwith this percentage gain: neither will be seen again in my\nlifetime. Our gain in per-share book value over the last twentyone years (that is, since present management took over) has been\nfrom $19.46 to $1643.71, or 23.2% compounded annually, another\npercentage that will not be repeated.\n\nTwo factors make anything approaching this rate of gain\nunachievable in the future. One factor probably transitory - is\na stock market that offers very little opportunity compared to\nthe markets that prevailed throughout much of the 1964-1984\nperiod. Today we cannot find significantly-undervalued equities\nto purchase for our insurance company portfolios. The current\nsituation is 180 degrees removed from that existing about a\ndecade ago, when the only question was which bargain to choose.\n\nThis change in the market also has negative implications for\nour present portfolio. In our 1974 annual report I could say:\nWe consider several of our major holdings to have great\npotential for significantly increased values in future years. I\ncant say that now. Its true that our insurance companies\ncurrently hold major positions in companies with exceptional\nunderlying economics and outstanding managements, just as they\ndid in 1974. But current market prices generously appraise these\nattributes, whereas they were ignored in 1974. Todays\nvaluations mean that our insurance companies have no chance for\nfuture portfolio gains on the scale of those achieved in the\npast.\n\nThe second negative factor, far more telling, is our size.\nOur equity capital is more than twenty times what it was only ten\nyears ago. And an iron law of business is that growth eventually\ndampens exceptional economics. just look at the records of highreturn companies once they have amassed even $1 billion of equity\ncapital. None that I know of has managed subsequently, over a\nten-year period, to keep on earning 20% or more on equity while\nreinvesting all or substantially all of its earnings. Instead,\nto sustain their high returns, such companies have needed to shed\na lot of capital by way of either dividends or repurchases of\nstock. Their shareholders would have been far better off if all\nearnings could have been reinvested at the fat returns earned by\nthese exceptional businesses. But the companies simply couldnt\nturn up enough high-return opportunities to make that possible.\n\nTheir problem is our problem. Last year I told you that we\nneeded profits of $3.9 billion over the ten years then coming up\nto earn 15% annually. The comparable figure for the ten years\nnow ahead is $5.7 billion, a 48% increase that corresponds - as\nit must mathematically - to the growth in our capital base during\n1985. (Heres a little perspective: leaving aside oil companies,\nonly about 15 U. S. businesses have managed to earn over $5.7\nbillion during the past ten years.)\n\nCharlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, and I are\nreasonably optimistic about Berkshires ability to earn returns\nsuperior to those earned by corporate America generally, and you\nwill benefit from the companys retention of all earnings as long\nas those returns are forthcoming. We have several things going\nfor us: (1) we dont have to worry about quarterly or annual\nfigures but, instead, can focus on whatever actions will maximize\nlong-term value; (2) we can expand the business into any areas\nthat make sense - our scope is not circumscribed by history,\nstructure, or concept; and (3) we love our work. All of these\nhelp. Even so, we will also need a full measure of good fortune\nto average our hoped-for 15% - far more good fortune than was\nrequired for our past 23.2%.\n\nWe need to mention one further item in the investment\nequation that could affect recent purchasers of our stock.\nHistorically, Berkshire shares have sold modestly below intrinsic\nbusiness value. With the price there, purchasers could be\ncertain (as long as they did not experience a widening of this\ndiscount) that their personal investment experience would at\nleast equal the financial experience of the business. But\nrecently the discount has disappeared, and occasionally a modest\npremium has prevailed.\n\nThe elimination of the discount means that Berkshires\nmarket value increased even faster than business value (which,\nitself, grew at a pleasing pace). That was good news for any\nowner holding while that move took place, but it is bad news for\nthe new or prospective owner. If the financial experience of new\nowners of Berkshire is merely to match the future financial\nexperience of the company, any premium of market value over\nintrinsic business value that they pay must be maintained.\n\nManagement cannot determine market prices, although it can,\nby its disclosures and policies, encourage rational behavior by\nmarket participants. My own preference, as perhaps youd guess,\nis for a market price that consistently approximates business\nvalue. Given that relationship, all owners prosper precisely as\nthe business prospers during their period of ownership. Wild\nswings in market prices far above and below business value do not\nchange the final gains for owners in aggregate; in the end,\ninvestor gains must equal business gains. But long periods of\nsubstantial undervaluation and/or overvaluation will cause the\ngains of the business to be inequitably distributed among various\nowners, with the investment result of any given owner largely\ndepending upon how lucky, shrewd, or foolish he happens to be.\n\nOver the long term there has been a more consistent\nrelationship between Berkshires market value and business value\nthan has existed for any other publicly-traded equity with which\nI am familiar. This is a tribute to you. Because you have been\nrational, interested, and investment-oriented, the market price\nfor Berkshire stock has almost always been sensible. This\nunusual result has been achieved by a shareholder group with\nunusual demographics: virtually all of our shareholders are\nindividuals, not institutions. No other public company our size\ncan claim the same.\n\nYou might think that institutions, with their large staffs\nof highly-paid and experienced investment professionals, would be\na force for stability and reason in financial markets. They are\nnot: stocks heavily owned and constantly monitored by\ninstitutions have often been among the most inappropriately\nvalued.\n\nBen Graham told a story 40 years ago that illustrates why\ninvestment professionals behave as they do: An oil prospector,\nmoving to his heavenly reward, was met by St. Peter with bad\nnews. Youre qualified for residence, said St. Peter, but, as\nyou can see, the compound reserved for oil men is packed.\nTheres no way to squeeze you in. After thinking a moment, the\nprospector asked if he might say just four words to the present\noccupants. That seemed harmless to St. Peter, so the prospector\ncupped his hands and yelled, Oil discovered in hell.\nImmediately the gate to the compound opened and all of the oil\nmen marched out to head for the nether regions. Impressed, St.\nPeter invited the prospector to move in and make himself\ncomfortable. The prospector paused. No, he said, I think\nIll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some\ntruth to that rumor after all.",

The change in their behavior recalls an\ninsight of Al Capone: You can get much further with a kind word\nand a gun than you can with a kind word alone.\n\nIn the table, amortization of Goodwill is not charged against the\nspecific businesses but, for reasons outlined in the Appendix to\nmy letter in the 1983 annual report, is aggregated as a separate\nitem.

      "start_anchor": "Our 1985 results include unusually large earnings from the\nsale of securities. This fact, in itself, does not mean that we\nhad a particularly good year (though, of course, we did).\nSecurity profits in a given year bear similarities to a college\ngraduation ceremony in which the knowledge gained over four years\nis recognized on a day when nothing further is learned. We may\nhold a stock for a decade or more, and during that period it may\ngrow quite consistently in both business and market value. In\nthe year in which we finally sell it there may be no increase in\nvalue, or there may even be a decrease. But all growth in value\nsince purchase will be reflected in the accounting earnings of\nthe year of sale. (If the stock owned is in our insurance\nsubsidiaries, however, any gain or loss in market value will be\nreflected in net worth annually.) Thus, reported capital gains or\nlosses in any given year are meaningless as a measure of how well\nwe have done in the current year.\n\nA large portion of the realized gain in 1985 ($338 million\npre-tax out of a total of $488 million) came about through the\nsale of our General Foods shares. We held most of these shares\nsince 1980, when we had purchased them at a price far below what\nwe felt was their per/share business value. Year by year, the\nmanagerial efforts of Jim Ferguson and Phil Smith substantially\nincreased General Foods business value and, last fall, Philip\nMorris made an offer for the company that reflected the increase.\nWe thus benefited from four factors: a bargain purchase price, a\nbusiness with fine underlying economics, an able management\nconcentrating on the interests of shareholders, and a buyer\nwilling to pay full business value. While that last factor is\nthe only one that produces reported earnings, we consider\nidentification of the first three to be the key to building value\nfor Berkshire shareholders. In selecting common stocks, we\ndevote our attention to attractive purchases, not to the\npossibility of attractive sales.\n\nWe have again reported substantial income from special\ndistributions, this year from Washington Post and General Foods.\n(The General Foods transactions obviously took place well before\nthe Philip Morris offer.) Distributions of this kind occur when\nwe sell a portion of our shares in a company back to it\nsimultaneously with its purchase of shares from other\nshareholders. The number of shares we sell is contractually set\nso as to leave our percentage ownership in the company precisely\nthe same after the sale as before. Such a transaction is quite\nproperly regarded by the IRS as substantially equivalent to a\ndividend since we, as a shareholder, receive cash while\nmaintaining an unchanged ownership interest. This tax treatment\nbenefits us because corporate taxpayers, unlike individual\ntaxpayers, incur much lower taxes on dividend income than on\nincome from long-term capital gains. (This difference will be\nwidened further if the House-passed tax bill becomes law: under\nits provisions, capital gains realized by corporations will be\ntaxed at the same rate as ordinary income.) However, accounting\nrules are unclear as to proper treatment for shareholder\nreporting. To conform with last years treatment, we have shown\nthese transactions as capital gains.\n\nThough we have not sought out such transactions, we have\nagreed to them on several occasions when managements initiated\nthe idea. In each case we have felt that non-selling\nshareholders (all of whom had an opportunity to sell at the same\nprice we received) benefited because the companies made their\nrepurchases at prices below intrinsic business value. The tax\nadvantages we receive and our wish to cooperate with managements\nthat are increasing values for all shareholders have sometimes\nled us to sell - but only to the extent that our proportional\nshare of the business was undiminished.",

      "start_anchor": "At this point we usually turn to a discussion of some of our\nmajor business units. Before doing so, however, we should first\nlook at a failure at one of our smaller businesses. Our Vice\nChairman, Charlie Munger, has always emphasized the study of\nmistakes rather than successes, both in business and other\naspects of life. He does so in the spirit of the man who said:\nAll I want to know is where Im going to die so Ill never go\nthere. Youll immediately see why we make a good team: Charlie\nlikes to study errors and I have generated ample material for\nhim, particularly in our textile and insurance businesses.\n\nShutdown of Textile Business\n\nIn July we decided to close our textile operation, and by\nyearend this unpleasant job was largely completed. The history\nof this business is instructive.\n\nWhen Buffett Partnership, Ltd., an investment partnership of\nwhich I was general partner, bought control of Berkshire Hathaway\n21 years ago, it had an accounting net worth of $22 million, all\ndevoted to the textile business. The companys intrinsic\nbusiness value, however, was considerably less because the\ntextile assets were unable to earn returns commensurate with\ntheir accounting value. Indeed, during the previous nine years\n(the period in which Berkshire and Hathaway operated as a merged\ncompany) aggregate sales of $530 million had produced an\naggregate loss of $10 million. Profits had been reported from\ntime to time but the net effect was always one step forward, two\nsteps back.\n\nAt the time we made our purchase, southern textile plants -\nlargely non-union - were believed to have an important\ncompetitive advantage. Most northern textile operations had\nclosed and many people thought we would liquidate our business as\nwell.\n\nWe felt, however, that the business would be run much better\nby a long-time employee whom. we immediately selected to be\npresident, Ken Chace. In this respect we were 100% correct: Ken\nand his recent successor, Garry Morrison, have been excellent\nmanagers, every bit the equal of managers at our more profitable\nbusinesses.\n\nIn early 1967 cash generated by the textile operation was\nused to fund our entry into insurance via the purchase of\nNational Indemnity Company. Some of the money came from earnings\nand some from reduced investment in textile inventories,\nreceivables, and fixed assets. This pullback proved wise:\nalthough much improved by Kens management, the textile business\nnever became a good earner, not even in cyclical upturns.\n\nFurther diversification for Berkshire followed, and\ngradually the textile operations depressing effect on our\noverall return diminished as the business became a progressively\nsmaller portion of the corporation. We remained in the business\nfor reasons that I stated in the 1978 annual report (and\nsummarized at other times also): (1) our textile businesses are\nvery important employers in their communities, (2) management has\nbeen straightforward in reporting on problems and energetic in\nattacking them, (3) labor has been cooperative and understanding\nin facing our common problems, and (4) the business should\naverage modest cash returns relative to investment. I further\nsaid, As long as these conditions prevail - and we expect that\nthey will - we intend to continue to support our textile business\ndespite more attractive alternative uses for capital.\n\nIt turned out that I was very wrong about (4). Though 1979\nwas moderately profitable, the business thereafter consumed major\namounts of cash. By mid-1985 it became clear, even to me, that\nthis condition was almost sure to continue. Could we have found\na buyer who would continue operations, I would have certainly\npreferred to sell the business rather than liquidate it, even if\nthat meant somewhat lower proceeds for us. But the economics\nthat were finally obvious to me were also obvious to others, and\ninterest was nil.\n\nI wont close down businesses of sub-normal profitability\nmerely to add a fraction of a point to our corporate rate of\nreturn. However, I also feel it inappropriate for even an\nexceptionally profitable company to fund an operation once it\nappears to have unending losses in prospect. Adam Smith would\ndisagree with my first proposition, and Karl Marx would disagree\nwith my second; the middle ground is the only position that\nleaves me comfortable.\n\nI should reemphasize that Ken and Garry have been\nresourceful, energetic and imaginative in attempting to make our\ntextile operation a success. Trying to achieve sustainable\nprofitability, they reworked product lines, machinery\nconfigurations and distribution arrangements. We also made a\nmajor acquisition, Waumbec Mills, with the expectation of\nimportant synergy (a term widely used in business to explain an\nacquisition that otherwise makes no sense). But in the end\nnothing worked and I should be faulted for not quitting sooner.\nA recent\nBusiness Week\narticle stated that 250 textile mills have\nclosed since 1980. Their owners were not privy to any\ninformation that was unknown to me; they simply processed it more\nobjectively. I ignored Comtes advice - the intellect should be\nthe servant of the heart, but not its slave - and believed what\nI preferred to believe.\n\nThe domestic textile industry operates in a commodity\nbusiness, competing in a world market in which substantial excess\ncapacity exists. Much of the trouble we experienced was\nattributable, both directly and indirectly, to competition from\nforeign countries whose workers are paid a small fraction of the\nU. S. minimum wage. But that in no way means that our labor force\ndeserves any blame for our closing. In fact, in comparison with\nemployees of American industry generally, our workers were poorly\npaid, as has been the case throughout the textile business. In\ncontract negotiations, union leaders and members were sensitive\nto our disadvantageous cost position and did not push for\nunrealistic wage increases or unproductive work practices. To\nthe contrary, they tried just as hard as we did to keep us\ncompetitive. Even during our liquidation period they performed\nsuperbly. (Ironically, we would have been better off financially\nif our union had behaved unreasonably some years ago; we then\nwould have recognized the impossible future that we faced,\npromptly closed down, and avoided significant future losses.)\n\nOver the years, we had the option of making large capital\nexpenditures in the textile operation that would have allowed us\nto somewhat reduce variable costs. Each proposal to do so looked\nlike an immediate winner. Measured by standard return-oninvestment tests, in fact, these proposals usually promised\ngreater economic benefits than would have resulted from\ncomparable expenditures in our highly-profitable candy and\nnewspaper businesses.\n\nBut the promised benefits from these textile investments\nwere illusory. Many of our competitors, both domestic and\nforeign, were stepping up to the same kind of expenditures and,\nonce enough companies did so, their reduced costs became the\nbaseline for reduced prices industrywide. Viewed individually,\neach companys capital investment decision appeared costeffective and rational; viewed collectively, the decisions\nneutralized each other and were irrational (just as happens when\neach person watching a parade decides he can see a little better\nif he stands on tiptoes). After each round of investment, all\nthe players had more money in the game and returns remained\nanemic.\n\nThus, we faced a miserable choice: huge capital investment\nwould have helped to keep our textile business alive, but would\nhave left us with terrible returns on ever-growing amounts of\ncapital. After the investment, moreover, the foreign competition\nwould still have retained a major, continuing advantage in labor\ncosts. A refusal to invest, however, would make us increasingly\nnon-competitive, even measured against domestic textile\nmanufacturers. I always thought myself in the position described\nby Woody Allen in one of his movies: More than any other time in\nhistory, mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair\nand utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction. Let us\npray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.\n\nFor an understanding of how the to-invest-or-not-to-invest\ndilemma plays out in a commodity business, it is instructive to\nlook at Burlington Industries, by far the largest U. S. textile\ncompany both 21 years ago and now. In 1964 Burlington had sales\nof $1.2 billion against our $50 million. It had strengths in\nboth distribution and production that we could never hope to\nmatch and also, of course, had an earnings record far superior to\nours. Its stock sold at 60 at the end of 1964; ours was 13.\n\nBurlington made a decision to stick to the textile business,\nand in 1985 had sales of about $2.8 billion. During the 1964-85\nperiod, the company made capital expenditures of about $3\nbillion, far more than any other U. S. textile company and more\nthan $200-per-share on that $60 stock. A very large part of the\nexpenditures, I am sure, was devoted to cost improvement and\nexpansion. Given Burlingtons basic commitment to stay in\ntextiles, I would also surmise that the companys capital\ndecisions were quite rational.\n\nNevertheless, Burlington has lost sales volume in real\ndollars and has far lower returns on sales and equity now than 20\nyears ago. Split 2-for-1 in 1965, the stock now sells at 34 --\non an adjusted basis, just a little over its $60 price in 1964.\nMeanwhile, the CPI has more than tripled. Therefore, each share\ncommands about one-third the purchasing power it did at the end\nof 1964. Regular dividends have been paid but they, too, have\nshrunk significantly in purchasing power.\n\nThis devastating outcome for the shareholders indicates what\ncan happen when much brain power and energy are applied to a\nfaulty premise. The situation is suggestive of Samuel Johnsons\nhorse: A horse that can count to ten is a remarkable horse - not\na remarkable mathematician. Likewise, a textile company that\nallocates capital brilliantly within its industry is a remarkable\ntextile company - but not a remarkable business.\n\nMy conclusion from my own experiences and from much\nobservation of other businesses is that a good managerial record\n(measured by economic returns) is far more a function of what\nbusiness boat you get into than it is of how effectively you row\n(though intelligence and effort help considerably, of course, in\nany business, good or bad). Some years ago I wrote: When a\nmanagement with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business\nwith a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the\nreputation of the business that remains intact. Nothing has\nsince changed my point of view on that matter. Should you find\nyourself in a chronically-leaking boat, energy devoted to\nchanging vessels is likely to be more productive than energy\ndevoted to patching leaks.\n\n* * *\n\nThere is an investment postscript in our textile saga. Some\ninvestors weight book value heavily in their stock-buying\ndecisions (as I, in my early years, did myself). And some\neconomists and academicians believe replacement values are of\nconsiderable importance in calculating an appropriate price level\nfor the stock market as a whole. Those of both persuasions would\nhave received an education at the auction we held in early 1986\nto dispose of our textile machinery.\n\nThe equipment sold (including some disposed of in the few\nmonths prior to the auction) took up about 750,000 square feet of\nfactory space in New Bedford and was eminently usable. It\noriginally cost us about $13 million, including $2 million spent\nin 1980-84, and had a current book value of $866,000 (after\naccelerated depreciation). Though no sane management would have\nmade the investment, the equipment could have been replaced new\nfor perhaps $30-$50 million.\n\nGross proceeds from our sale of this equipment came to\n$163,122. Allowing for necessary pre- and post-sale costs, our\nnet was less than zero. Relatively modern looms that we bought\nfor $5,000 apiece in 1981 found no takers at $50. We finally\nsold them for scrap at $26 each, a sum less than removal costs.\n\nPonder this: the economic goodwill attributable to two paper\nroutes in Buffalo - or a single Sees candy store - considerably\nexceeds the proceeds we received from this massive collection of\ntangible assets that not too many years ago, under different\ncompetitive conditions, was able to employ over 1,000 people.",

      "start_anchor": "Three Very Good Businesses (and a Few Thoughts About Incentive\nCompensation)\n\nWhen I was 12, I lived with my grandfather for about four\nmonths. A grocer by trade, he was also working on a book and\neach night he dictated a few pages to me. The title - brace\nyourself - was How to Run a Grocery Store and a Few Things I\nHave Learned About Fishing. My grandfather was sure that\ninterest in these two subjects was universal and that the world\nawaited his views. You may conclude from this sections title\nand contents that I was overexposed to Grandpas literary style\n(and personality).\n\nI am merging the discussion of Nebraska Furniture Mart,\nSees Candy Shops, and Buffalo Evening News here because the\neconomic strengths, weaknesses, and prospects of these businesses\nhave changed little since I reported to you a year ago. The\nshortness of this discussion, however, is in no way meant to\nminimize the importance of these businesses to us: in 1985 they\nearned an aggregate of $72 million pre-tax. Fifteen years ago,\nbefore we had acquired any of them, their aggregate earnings were\nabout $8 million pre-tax.\n\nWhile an increase in earnings from $8 million to $72 million\nsounds terrific - and usually is - you should not automatically\nassume that to be the case. You must first make sure that\nearnings were not severely depressed in the base year. If they\nwere instead substantial in relation to capital employed, an even\nmore important point must be examined: how much additional\ncapital was required to produce the additional earnings?\n\nIn both respects, our group of three scores well. First,\nearnings 15 years ago were excellent compared to capital then\nemployed in the businesses. Second, although annual earnings are\nnow $64 million greater, the businesses require only about $40\nmillion more in invested capital to operate than was the case\nthen.\n\nThe dramatic growth in earning power of these three\nbusinesses, accompanied by their need for only minor amounts of\ncapital, illustrates very well the power of economic goodwill\nduring an inflationary period (a phenomenon explained in detail\nin the 1983 annual report). The financial characteristics of\nthese businesses have allowed us to use a very large portion of\nthe earnings they generate elsewhere. Corporate America,\nhowever, has had a different experience: in order to increase\nearnings significantly, most companies have needed to increase\ncapital significantly also. The average American business has\nrequired about $5 of additional capital to generate an additional\n$1 of annual pre-tax earnings. That business, therefore, would\nhave required over $300 million in additional capital from its\nowners in order to achieve an earnings performance equal to our\ngroup of three.\n\nWhen returns on capital are ordinary, an earn-more-byputting-up-more record is no great managerial achievement. You\ncan get the same result personally while operating from your\nrocking chair. just quadruple the capital you commit to a savings\naccount and you will quadruple your earnings. You would hardly\nexpect hosannas for that particular accomplishment. Yet,\nretirement announcements regularly sing the praises of CEOs who\nhave, say, quadrupled earnings of their widget company during\ntheir reign - with no one examining whether this gain was\nattributable simply to many years of retained earnings and the\nworkings of compound interest.\n\nIf the widget company consistently earned a superior return\non capital throughout the period, or if capital employed only\ndoubled during the CEOs reign, the praise for him may be well\ndeserved. But if return on capital was lackluster and capital\nemployed increased in pace with earnings, applause should be\nwithheld. A savings account in which interest was reinvested\nwould achieve the same year-by-year increase in earnings - and,\nat only 8% interest, would quadruple its annual earnings in 18\nyears.\n\nThe power of this simple math is often ignored by companies\nto the detriment of their shareholders. Many corporate\ncompensation plans reward managers handsomely for earnings\nincreases produced solely, or in large part, by retained earnings\n- i. e., earnings withheld from owners. For example, ten-year,\nfixed-price stock options are granted routinely, often by\ncompanies whose dividends are only a small percentage of\nearnings.\n\nAn example will illustrate the inequities possible under\nsuch circumstances. Lets suppose that you had a $100,000\nsavings account earning 8% interest and managed by a trustee\nwho could decide each year what portion of the interest you were\nto be paid in cash. Interest not paid out would be retained\nearnings added to the savings account to compound. And lets\nsuppose that your trustee, in his superior wisdom, set the payout ratio at one-quarter of the annual earnings.\n\nUnder these assumptions, your account would be worth\n$179,084 at the end of ten years. Additionally, your annual\nearnings would have increased about 70% from $8,000 to $13,515\nunder this inspired management. And, finally, your dividends\nwould have increased commensurately, rising regularly from $2,000\nin the first year to $3,378 in the tenth year. Each year, when\nyour managers public relations firm prepared his annual report\nto you, all of the charts would have had lines marching skyward.\n\nNow, just for fun, lets push our scenario one notch further\nand give your trustee-manager a ten-year fixed-price option on\npart of your business (i. e., your savings account) based on its\nfair value in the first year. With such an option, your manager\nwould reap a substantial profit at your expense - just from\nhaving held on to most of your earnings. If he were both\nMachiavellian and a bit of a mathematician, your manager might\nalso have cut the pay-out ratio once he was firmly entrenched.\n\nThis scenario is not as farfetched as you might think. Many\nstock options in the corporate world have worked in exactly that\nfashion: they have gained in value simply because management\nretained earnings, not because it did well with the capital in\nits hands.\n\nManagers actually apply a double standard to options.\nLeaving aside warrants (which deliver the issuing corporation\nimmediate and substantial compensation), I believe it is fair to\nsay that nowhere in the business world are ten-year fixed-price\noptions on all or a portion of a business granted to outsiders.\nTen months, in fact, would be regarded as extreme. It would be\nparticularly unthinkable for managers to grant a long-term option\non a business that was regularly adding to its capital. Any\noutsider wanting to secure such an option would be required to\npay fully for capital added during the option period.\n\nThe unwillingness of managers to do-unto-outsiders, however,\nis not matched by an unwillingness to do-unto-themselves.\n(Negotiating with ones self seldom produces a barroom brawl.)\nManagers regularly engineer ten-year, fixed-price options for\nthemselves and associates that, first, totally ignore the fact\nthat retained earnings automatically build value and, second,\nignore the carrying cost of capital. As a result, these managers\nend up profiting much as they would have had they had an option\non that savings account that was automatically building up in\nvalue.\n\nOf course, stock options often go to talented, value-adding\nmanagers and sometimes deliver them rewards that are perfectly\nappropriate. (Indeed, managers who are really exceptional almost\nalways get far less than they should.) But when the result is\nequitable, it is accidental. Once granted, the option is blind\nto individual performance. Because it is irrevocable and\nunconditional (so long as a manager stays in the company), the\nsluggard receives rewards from his options precisely as does the\nstar. A managerial Rip Van Winkle, ready to doze for ten years,\ncould not wish for a better incentive system.\n\n(I cant resist commenting on one long-term option given an\noutsider: that granted the U. S. Government on Chrysler shares\nas partial consideration for the governments guarantee of some\nlifesaving loans. When these options worked out well for the\ngovernment, Chrysler sought to modify the payoff, arguing that\nthe rewards to the government were both far greater than intended\nand outsize in relation to its contribution to Chryslers\nrecovery. The companys anguish over what it saw as an imbalance\nbetween payoff and performance made national news. That anguish\nmay well be unique: to my knowledge, no managers - anywhere -\nhave been similarly offended by unwarranted payoffs arising from\noptions granted to themselves or their colleagues.)\n\nIronically, the rhetoric about options frequently describes\nthem as desirable because they put managers and owners in the\nsame financial boat. In reality, the boats are far different.\nNo owner has ever escaped the burden of capital costs, whereas a\nholder of a fixed-price option bears no capital costs at all. An\nowner must weigh upside potential against downside risk; an\noption holder has no downside. In fact, the business project in\nwhich you would wish to have an option frequently is a project in\nwhich you would reject ownership. (Ill be happy to accept a\nlottery ticket as a gift - but Ill never buy one.)\n\nIn dividend policy also, the option holders interests are\nbest served by a policy that may ill serve the owner. Think back\nto the savings account example. The trustee, holding his option,\nwould benefit from a no-dividend policy. Conversely, the owner\nof the account should lean to a total payout so that he can\nprevent the option-holding manager from sharing in the accounts\nretained earnings.\n\nDespite their shortcomings, options can be appropriate under\nsome circumstances. My criticism relates to their indiscriminate\nuse and, in that connection, I would like to emphasize three\npoints:\n\nFirst, stock options are inevitably tied to the overall\nperformance of a corporation. Logically, therefore, they should\nbe awarded only to those managers with overall responsibility.\nManagers with limited areas of responsibility should have\nincentives that pay off in relation to results under their\ncontrol. The . 350 hitter expects, and also deserves, a big\npayoff for his performance - even if he plays for a cellardwelling team. And the . 150 hitter should get no reward - even\nif he plays for a pennant winner. Only those with overall\nresponsibility for the team should have their rewards tied to its\nresults.\n\nSecond, options should be structured carefully. Absent\nspecial factors, they should have built into them a retainedearnings or carrying-cost factor. Equally important, they should\nbe priced realistically. When managers are faced with offers for\ntheir companies, they unfailingly point out how unrealistic\nmarket prices can be as an index of real value. But why, then,\nshould these same depressed prices be the valuations at which\nmanagers sell portions of their businesses to themselves? (They\nmay go further: officers and directors sometimes consult the Tax\nCode to determine the\nlowest\nprices at which they can, in effect,\nsell part of the business to insiders. While theyre at it, they\noften elect plans that produce the worst tax result for the\ncompany.) Except in highly unusual cases, owners are not well\nserved by the sale of part of their business at a bargain price -\nwhether the sale is to outsiders or to insiders. The obvious\nconclusion: options should be priced at true business value.\n\nThird, I want to emphasize that some managers whom I admire\nenormously - and whose operating records are far better than mine\n- disagree with me regarding fixed-price options. They have\nbuilt corporate cultures that work, and fixed-price options have\nbeen a tool that helped them. By their leadership and example,\nand by the use of options as incentives, these managers have\ntaught their colleagues to think like owners. Such a Culture is\nrare and when it exists should perhaps be left intact - despite\ninefficiencies and inequities that may infest the option program.\nIf it aint broke, dont fix it is preferable to purity at any\nprice.\n\nAt Berkshire, however, we use an incentive@compensation\nsystem that rewards key managers for meeting targets in their own\nbailiwicks. If Sees does well, that does not produce incentive\ncompensation at the News - nor vice versa. Neither do we look at\nthe price of Berkshire stock when we write bonus checks. We\nbelieve good unit performance should be rewarded whether\nBerkshire stock rises, falls, or stays even. Similarly, we think\naverage performance should earn no special rewards even if our\nstock should soar. Performance, furthermore, is defined in\ndifferent ways depending upon the underlying economics of the\nbusiness: in some our managers enjoy tailwinds not of their own\nmaking, in others they fight unavoidable headwinds.\n\nThe rewards that go with this system can be large. At our\nvarious business units, top managers sometimes receive incentive\nbonuses of five times their base salary, or more, and it would\nappear possible that one managers bonus could top $2 million in\n1986. (I hope so.) We do not put a cap on bonuses, and the\npotential for rewards is not hierarchical. The manager of a\nrelatively small unit can earn far more than the manager of a\nlarger unit if results indicate he should. We believe, further,\nthat such factors as seniority and age should not affect\nincentive compensation (though they sometimes influence basic\ncompensation). A 20-year-old who can hit . 300 is as valuable to\nus as a 40-year-old performing as well.\n\nObviously, all Berkshire managers can use their bonus money\n(or other funds, including borrowed money) to buy our stock in\nthe market. Many have done just that - and some now have large\nholdings. By accepting both the risks and the carrying costs\nthat go with outright purchases, these managers truly walk in the\nshoes of owners.",

NFM is the largest store of its kind in the\ncountry. Although the already-depressed farm economy worsened\nconsiderably in 1985, the store easily set a new sales record. I\nalso am happy to report that NFMs Chairman, Rose Blumkin (the\nlegendary Mrs. B), continues at age 92 to set a pace at the\nstore that none of us can keep up with. Shes there wheeling and\ndealing seven days a week, and I hope that any of you who visit\nOmaha will go out to the Mart and see her in action. It will\ninspire you, as it does me.\n\nAt Sees we continue to get store volumes that are far\nbeyond those achieved by any competitor we know of. Despite the\nunmatched consumer acceptance we enjoy, industry trends are not\ngood, and we continue to experience slippage in poundage sales on\na same-store basis. This puts pressure on per-pound costs. We\nnow are willing to increase prices only modestly and, unless we\ncan stabilize per-shop poundage, profit margins will narrow.\n\nAt the News volume gains are also difficult to achieve.\nThough linage increased during 1985, the gain was more than\naccounted for by preprints. ROP linage (advertising printed on\nour own pages) declined. Preprints are far less profitable than\nROP ads, and also more vulnerable to competition. In 1985, the\nNews again controlled costs well and our household penetration\ncontinues to be exceptional.\n\nOne problem these three operations do not have is\nmanagement. At Sees we have Chuck Huggins, the man we put in\ncharge the day we bought the business. Selecting him remains one\nof our best business decisions. At the News we have Stan Lipsey,\na manager of equal caliber. Stan has been with us 17 years, and\nhis unusual business talents have become more evident with every\nadditional level of responsibility he has tackled. And, at the\nMart, we have the amazing Blumkins - Mrs. B, Louie, Ron, Irv, and\nSteve - a three-generation miracle of management.\n\nI consider myself extraordinarily lucky to be able to work\nwith managers such as these.

The\nrevenue gain was exceptional, and had insured losses grown at\ntheir normal rate of most recent years - that is, a few points\nabove the inflation rate - a significant drop in the combined\nratio would have occurred. But losses in 1985 didnt cooperate,\nas they did not in 1984. Though inflation slowed considerably in\nthese years, insured losses perversely accelerated, growing by\n16% in 1984 and by an even more startling 17% in 1985. The\nyears growth in losses therefore exceeds the inflation rate by\nover 13 percentage points, a modern record.\n\nCatastrophes were not the culprit in this explosion of loss\ncost. True, there were an unusual number of hurricanes in 1985,\nbut the aggregate damage caused by all catastrophes in 1984 and\n1985 was about 2% of premium volume, a not unusual proportion.\nNor was there any burst in the number of insured autos, houses,\nemployers, or other kinds of exposure units.\n\nA partial explanation for the surge in the loss figures is\nall the additions to reserves that the industry made in 1985. As\nresults for the year were reported, the scene resembled a revival\nmeeting: shouting Ive sinned, Ive sinned, insurance managers\nrushed forward to confess they had under reserved in earlier\nyears. Their corrections significantly affected 1985 loss\nnumbers.\n\nA more disturbing ingredient in the loss surge is the\nacceleration in social or judicial inflation. The insurers\nability to pay has assumed overwhelming importance with juries\nand judges in the assessment of both liability and damages. More\nand more, the deep pocket is being sought and found, no matter\nwhat the policy wording, the facts, or the precedents.\n\nThis judicial inflation represents a wild card in the\nindustrys future, and makes forecasting difficult.\nNevertheless, the short-term outlook is good. Premium growth\nimproved as 1985 went along (quarterly gains were an estimated\n15%, 19%, 24%, and 22%) and, barring a supercatastrophe, the\nindustrys combined ratio should fall sharply in 1986.\n\nThe profit improvement, however, is likely to be of short\nduration. Two economic principles will see to that. First,\ncommodity businesses achieve good levels of profitability only\nwhen prices are fixed in some manner or when capacity is short.\nSecond, managers quickly add to capacity when prospects start to\nimprove and capital is available.\n\nIn my 1982 report to you, I discussed the commodity nature\nof the insurance industry extensively. The typical policyholder\ndoes not differentiate between products but concentrates instead\non price. For many decades a cartel-like procedure kept prices\nup, but this arrangement has disappeared for good. The insurance\nproduct now is priced as any other commodity for which a free\nmarket exists: when capacity is tight, prices will be set\nremuneratively; otherwise, they will not.\n\nCapacity currently is tight in many lines of insurance -\nthough in this industry, unlike most, capacity is an attitudinal\nconcept, not a physical fact. Insurance managers can write\nwhatever amount of business they feel comfortable writing,\nsubject only to pressures applied by regulators and Bests, the\nindustrys authoritative rating service. The comfort level of\nboth managers and regulators is tied to capital. More capital\nmeans more comfort, which in turn means more capacity. In the\ntypical commodity business, furthermore, such as aluminum or\nsteel, a long gestation precedes the birth of additional\ncapacity. In the insurance industry, capital can be secured\ninstantly. Thus, any capacity shortage can be eliminated in\nshort order.\n\nThats exactly whats going on right now. In 1985, about 15\ninsurers raised well over $3 billion, piling up capital so that\nthey can write all the business possible at the better prices now\navailable. The capital-raising trend has accelerated\ndramatically so far in 1986.\n\nIf capacity additions continue at this rate, it wont be\nlong before serious price-cutting appears and next a fall in\nprofitability. When the fall comes, it will be the fault of the\ncapital-raisers of 1985 and 1986, not the price-cutters of 198 X.\n(Critics should be understanding, however: as was the case in our\ntextile example, the dynamics of capitalism cause each insurer to\nmake decisions that for itself appear sensible, but that\ncollectively slash profitability.)",

      "start_anchor": "In past reports, I have told you that Berkshires strong\ncapital position - the best in the industry - should one day\nallow us to claim a distinct competitive advantage in the\ninsurance market. With the tightening of the market, that day\narrived. Our premium volume more than tripled last year,\nfollowing a long period of stagnation. Berkshires financial\nstrength (and our record of maintaining unusual strength through\nthick and thin) is now a major asset for us in securing good\nbusiness.\n\nWe correctly foresaw a flight to quality by many large\nbuyers of insurance and reinsurance who belatedly recognized that\na policy is only an IOU - and who, in 1985, could not collect on\nmany of their IOUs. These buyers today are attracted to\nBerkshire because of its strong capital position. But, in a\ndevelopment we did not foresee, we also are finding buyers drawn\nto us because our ability to insure substantial risks sets us\napart from the crowd.\n\nTo understand this point, you need a few background facts\nabout large risks. Traditionally, many insurers have wanted to\nwrite this kind of business. However, their willingness to do so\nhas been almost always based upon reinsurance arrangements that\nallow the insurer to keep just a small portion of the risk itself\nwhile passing on (laying off) most of the risk to its\nreinsurers. Imagine, for example, a directors and officers\n(D & O) liability policy providing $25 million of coverage.\nBy various excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts, the company\nissuing that policy might keep the liability for only the first\n$1 million of any loss that occurs. The liability for any loss\nabove that amount up to $24 million would be borne by the\nreinsurers of the issuing insurer. In trade parlance, a company\nthat issues large policies but retains relatively little of the\nrisk itself writes a large gross line but a small net line.\n\nIn any reinsurance arrangement, a key question is how the\npremiums paid for the policy should be divided among the various\nlayers of risk. In our D & O policy, for example. what part of\nthe premium received should be kept by the issuing company to\ncompensate it fairly for taking the first $1 million of risk and\nhow much should be passed on to the reinsurers to compensate them\nfairly for taking the risk between $1 million and $25 million?\n\nOne way to solve this problem might be deemed the Patrick\nHenry approach: I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided,\nand that is the lamp of experience. In other words, how much of\nthe total premium would reinsurers have needed in the past to\ncompensate them fairly for the losses they actually had to bear?\n\nUnfortunately, the lamp of experience has always provided\nimperfect illumination for reinsurers because so much of their\nbusiness is long-tail, meaning it takes many years before they\nknow what their losses are. Lately, however, the light has not\nonly been dim but also grossly misleading in the images it has\nrevealed. That is, the courts tendency to grant awards that are\nboth huge and lacking in precedent makes reinsurers usual\nextrapolations or inferences from past data a formula for\ndisaster. Out with Patrick Henry and in with Pogo: The future\naint what it used to be.\n\nThe burgeoning uncertainties of the business, coupled with\nthe entry into reinsurance of many unsophisticated participants,\nworked in recent years in favor of issuing companies writing a\nsmall net line: they were able to keep a far greater percentage\nof the premiums than the risk. By doing so, the issuing\ncompanies sometimes made money on business that was distinctly\nunprofitable for the issuing and reinsuring companies combined.\n(This result was not necessarily by intent: issuing companies\ngenerally knew no more than reinsurers did about the ultimate\ncosts that would be experienced at higher layers of risk.)\nInequities of this sort have been particularly pronounced in\nlines of insurance in which much change was occurring and losses\nwere soaring; e. g., professional malpractice, D & 0, products\nliability, etc. Given these circumstances, it is not surprising\nthat issuing companies remained enthusiastic about writing\nbusiness long after premiums became woefully inadequate on a\ngross basis.\n\nAn example of just how disparate results have been for\nissuing companies versus their reinsurers is provided by the 1984\nfinancials of one of the leaders in large and unusual risks. In\nthat year the company wrote about $6 billion of business and kept\naround $2 1/2 billion of the premiums, or about 40%. It gave the\nremaining $3 1/2 billion to reinsurers. On the part of the\nbusiness kept, the companys underwriting loss was less than $200\nmillion - an excellent result in that year. Meanwhile, the part\nlaid off produced a loss of over $1.5 billion for the reinsurers.\nThus, the issuing company wrote at a combined ratio of well under\n110 while its reinsurers, participating in precisely the same\npolicies, came in considerably over 140. This result was not\nattributable to natural catastrophes; it came from run-of-themill insurance losses (occurring, however, in surprising\nfrequency and size). The issuing companys 1985 report is not\nyet available, but I would predict it will show that dramatically\nunbalanced results continued.\n\nA few years such as this, and even slow-witted reinsurers\ncan lose interest, particularly in explosive lines where the\nproper split in premium between issuer and reinsurer remains\nimpossible to even roughly estimate. The behavior of reinsurers\nfinally becomes like that of Mark Twains cat: having once sat on\na hot stove, it never did so again - but it never again sat on a\ncold stove, either. Reinsurers have had so many unpleasant\nsurprises in long-tail casualty lines that many have decided\n(probably correctly) to give up the game entirely, regardless of\nprice inducements. Consequently, there has been a dramatic pullback of reinsurance capacity in certain important lines.",

Our contract\nruns for four years, and provides that our losses and costs will\nbe proportionate to theirs throughout the contract period. If\nthere is no extension, we will thereafter have no participation\nin any ongoing business. However, for a great many years in the\nfuture, we will be reimbursing FFIC for our 7% of the losses that\noccurred in the September 1,1985 - August 31,1989 period.\n\nUnder the contract FFIC remits premiums to us promptly and\nwe reimburse FFIC promptly for expenses and losses it has paid.\nThus, funds generated by our share of the business are held by us\nfor investment. As part of the deal, Im available to FFIC for\nconsultation about general investment strategy. Im not\ninvolved, however, in specific investment decisions of FFIC, nor\nis Berkshire involved in any aspect of the companys underwriting\nactivities.\n\nCurrently FFIC is doing about $3 billion of business, and it\nwill probably do more as rates rise. The companys September 1,1985 unearned premium reserve was $1.324 billion, and it\ntherefore transferred 7% of this, or $92.7 million, to us at\ninitiation of the contract. We concurrently paid them $29.4\nmillion representing the underwriting expenses that they had\nincurred on the transferred premium. All of the FFIC business is\nwritten by National Indemnity Company, but two-sevenths of it is\npassed along to Wesco-Financial Insurance Company (Wes-FIC), a\nnew company organized by our 80%-owned subsidiary, Wesco\nFinancial Corporation. Charlie Munger has some interesting\ncomments about Wes-FIC and the reinsurance business on pages 6062.\n\nTo the Insurance Segment tables on page 41, we have added a\nnew line, labeled Major Quota Share Contracts. The 1985 results\nof the FFIC contract are reported there, though the newness of\nthe arrangement makes these results only very rough\napproximations.\n\nAfter the end of the year, we secured another quota-share\ncontract, whose 1986 volume should be over $50 million. We hope\nto develop more of this business, and industry conditions suggest\nthat we could: a significant number of companies are generating\nmore business than they themselves can prudently handle.

This now seems hard to believe. However, these\ninstitutions were then under the spell of academics at\nprestigious business schools who were preaching a newly-fashioned\ntheory: the stock market was totally efficient, and therefore\ncalculations of business value - and even thought, itself - were\nof no importance in investment activities. (We are enormously\nindebted to those academics: what could be more advantageous in\nan intellectual contest - whether it be bridge, chess, or stock\nselection than to have opponents who have been taught that\nthinking is a waste of energy?)\n\nThrough 1973 and 1974, WPC continued to do fine as a\nbusiness, and intrinsic value grew. Nevertheless, by yearend\n1974 our WPC holding showed a loss of about 25%, with market\nvalue at $8 million against our cost of $10.6 million. What we\nhad thought ridiculously cheap a year earlier had become a good\nbit cheaper as the market, in its infinite wisdom, marked WPC\nstock down to well below 20 cents on the dollar of intrinsic\nvalue.\n\nYou know the happy outcome. Kay Graham, CEO of WPC, had the\nbrains and courage to repurchase large quantities of stock for\nthe company at those bargain prices, as well as the managerial\nskills necessary to dramatically increase business values.\nMeanwhile, investors began to recognize the exceptional economics\nof the business and the stock price moved closer to underlying\nvalue. Thus, we experienced a triple dip: the companys business\nvalue soared upward, per-share business value increased\nconsiderably faster because of stock repurchases and, with a\nnarrowing of the discount, the stock price outpaced the gain in\nper-share business value.\n\nWe hold all of the WPC shares we bought in 1973, except for\nthose sold back to the company in 1985 s proportionate\nredemption.

Our gain would have far exceeded the gain in\nthe general market, an outcome reflecting the exceptional\neconomics of the media business. The extra $160 million or so we\ngained through ownership of WPC came, in very large part, from\nthe superior nature of the managerial decisions made by Kay as\ncompared to those made by managers of most media companies.

This is a short-term arbitrage\nholding - in effect, a parking place for money (though not a\ntotally safe one, since deals sometimes fall through and create\nsubstantial losses). We sometimes enter the arbitrage field when\nwe have more money than ideas, but only to participate in\nannounced mergers and sales. We would be a lot happier if the\nfunds currently employed on this short-term basis found a longterm home. At the moment, however, prospects are bleak.\n\nAt yearend our insurance subsidiaries had about $400 million\nin tax-exempt bonds, of which $194 million at amortized cost were\nissues of Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS)\nProjects 1,2, and 3.1 discussed this position fully last year,\nand explained why we would not disclose further purchases or\nsales until well after the fact (adhering to the policy we follow\non stocks). Our unrealized gain on the WPPSS bonds at yearend\nwas $62 million, perhaps one-third arising from the upward\nmovement of bonds generally, and the remainder from a more\npositive investor view toward WPPSS 1,2, and 3 s. Annual taxexempt income from our WPPSS issues is about $30 million.\n\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc.\n\nRight after yearend, Berkshire purchased 3 million shares of\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. (Cap Cities) at $172.50 per share, the\nmarket price of such shares at the time the commitment was made\nearly in March, 1985. Ive been on record for many years about\nthe management of Cap Cities: I think it is the best of any\npublicly-owned company in the country. And Tom Murphy and Dan\nBurke are not only great managers, they are precisely the sort of\nfellows that you would want your daughter to marry.

      "start_anchor": "Our purchase of stock helped Cap Cities finance the $3.5\nbillion acquisition of American Broadcasting Companies. For Cap\nCities, ABC is a major undertaking whose economics are likely to\nbe unexciting over the next few years. This bothers us not an\niota; we can be very patient. (No matter how great the talent or\neffort, some things just take time: you cant produce a baby in\none month by getting nine women pregnant.)\n\nAs evidence of our confidence, we have executed an unusual\nagreement: for an extended period Tom, as CEO (or Dan, should he\nbe CEO) votes our stock. This arrangement was initiated by\nCharlie and me, not by Tom. We also have restricted ourselves in\nvarious ways regarding sale of our shares. The object of these\nrestrictions is to make sure that our block does not get sold to\nanyone who is a large holder (or intends to become a large\nholder) without the approval of management, an arrangement\nsimilar to ones we initiated some years ago at GEICO and\nWashington Post.\n\nSince large blocks frequently command premium prices, some\nmight think we have injured Berkshire financially by creating\nsuch restrictions. Our view is just the opposite. We feel the\nlong-term economic prospects for these businesses - and, thus,\nfor ourselves as owners - are enhanced by the arrangements. With\nthem in place, the first-class managers with whom we have aligned\nourselves can focus their efforts entirely upon running the\nbusinesses and maximizing long-term values for owners. Certainly\nthis is much better than having those managers distracted by\nrevolving-door capitalists hoping to put the company in play.\n(Of course, some managers place their own interests above those\nof the company and its owners and deserve to be shaken up - but,\nin making investments, we try to steer clear of this type.)\n\nToday, corporate instability is an inevitable consequence of\nwidely-diffused ownership of voting stock. At any time a major\nholder can surface, usually mouthing reassuring rhetoric but\nfrequently harboring uncivil intentions. By circumscribing our\nblocks of stock as we often do, we intend to promote stability\nwhere it otherwise might be lacking. That kind of certainty,\ncombined with a good manager and a good business, provides\nexcellent soil for a rich financial harvest. Thats the economic\ncase for our arrangements.\n\nThe human side is just as important. We dont want managers\nwe like and admire - and who have welcomed a major financial\ncommitment by us - to ever lose any sleep wondering whether\nsurprises might occur because of our large ownership. I have\ntold them there will be no surprises, and these agreements put\nBerkshires signature where my mouth is. That signature also\nmeans the managers have a corporate commitment and therefore need\nnot worry if my personal participation in Berkshires affairs\nends prematurely (a term I define as any age short of three\ndigits).\n\nOur Cap Cities purchase was made at a full price, reflecting\nthe very considerable enthusiasm for both media stocks and media\nproperties that has developed in recent years (and that, in the\ncase of some property purchases, has approached a mania). its no\nfield for bargains. However, our Cap Cities investment allies us\nwith an exceptional combination of properties and people - and we\nlike the opportunity to participate in size.\n\nOf course, some of you probably wonder why we are now buying\nCap Cities at $172.50 per share given that your Chairman, in a\ncharacteristic burst of brilliance, sold Berkshires holdings in\nthe same company at $43 per share in 1978-80. Anticipating your\nquestion, I spent much of 1985 working on a snappy answer that\nwould reconcile these acts.\n\nA little more time, please.",

      "start_anchor": "Acquisition of Scott & Fetzer\n\nRight after yearend we acquired The Scott & Fetzer Company\n(Scott Fetzer) of Cleveland for about $320 million. (In\naddition, about $90 million of pre-existing Scott Fetzer debt\nremains in place.) In the next section of this report I describe\nthe sort of businesses that we wish to buy for Berkshire. Scott\nFetzer is a prototype - understandable, large, well-managed, a\ngood earner.\n\nThe company has sales of about $700 million derived from 17\nbusinesses, many leaders in their fields. Return on invested\ncapital is good to excellent for most of these businesses. Some\nwell-known products are Kirby home-care systems, Campbell\nHausfeld air compressors, and Wayne burners and water pumps.\n\nWorld Book, Inc. - accounting for about 40% of Scott\nFetzers sales and a bit more of its income - is by far the\ncompanys largest operation. It also is by far the leader in its\nindustry, selling more than twice as many encyclopedia sets\nannually as its nearest competitor. In fact, it sells more sets\nin the U. S. than its four biggest competitors combined.\n\nCharlie and I have a particular interest in the World Book\noperation because we regard its encyclopedia as something\nspecial. Ive been a fan (and user) for 25 years, and now have\ngrandchildren consulting the sets just as my children did. World\nBook is regularly rated the most useful encyclopedia by teachers,\nlibrarians and consumer buying guides. Yet it sells for less\nthan any of its major competitors. Childcraft, another World\nBook, Inc. product, offers similar value. This combination of\nexceptional products and modest prices at World Book, Inc. helped\nmake us willing to pay the price demanded for Scott Fetzer,\ndespite declining results for many companies in the directselling industry.\n\nAn equal attraction at Scott Fetzer is Ralph Schey, its CEO\nfor nine years. When Ralph took charge, the company had 31\nbusinesses, the result of an acquisition spree in the 1960 s. He\ndisposed of many that did not fit or had limited profit\npotential, but his focus on rationalizing the original potpourri\nwas not so intense that he passed by World Book when it became\navailable for purchase in 1978. Ralphs operating and capitalallocation record is superb, and we are delighted to be\nassociated with him.\n\nThe history of the Scott Fetzer acquisition is interesting,\nmarked by some zigs and zags before we became involved. The\ncompany had been an announced candidate for purchase since early\n1984. A major investment banking firm spent many months\ncanvassing scores of prospects, evoking interest from several.\nFinally, in mid-1985 a plan of sale, featuring heavy\nparticipation by an ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan), was\napproved by shareholders. However, as difficulty in closing\nfollowed, the plan was scuttled.\n\nI had followed this corporate odyssey through the\nnewspapers. On October 10, well after the ESOP deal had fallen\nthrough, I wrote a short letter to Ralph, whom I did not know. I\nsaid we admired the companys record and asked if he might like\nto talk. Charlie and I met Ralph for dinner in Chicago on\nOctober 22 and signed an acquisition contract the following week.\n\nThe Scott Fetzer acquisition, plus major growth in our\ninsurance business, should push revenues above $2 billion in\n1986, more than double those of 1985.",

Those attending behaved just\nas those present in previous years, asking the sort of questions\nyou would expect from intelligent and interested owners. You can\nattend a great many annual meetings without running into a crowd\nlike ours. (Lester Maddox, when Governor of Georgia, was\ncriticized regarding the states abysmal prison system. The\nsolution, he said, is simple. All we need is a better class of\nprisoners. Upgrading annual meetings works the same way.)\n\nI hope you come to this years meeting, which will be held\non May 20 in Omaha. There will be only one change: after 48\nyears of allegiance to another soft drink, your Chairman, in an\nunprecedented display of behavioral flexibility, has converted to\nthe new Cherry Coke. Henceforth, it will be the Official Drink\nof the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting.\n\nAnd bring money: Mrs. B promises to have bargains galore if\nyou will pay her a visit at The Nebraska Furniture Mart after the\nmeeting.",
