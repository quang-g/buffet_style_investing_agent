We do promise you, however, that virtually\nall of the gains Berkshire makes will end up with shareholders. We are\nhere to make money with you, not off you.\n\nThe Relationship of Intrinsic Value to Market Price\n\nIn last year's letter, with Berkshire shares selling at $36,000, I\ntold you: (1) Berkshire's gain in market value in recent years had\noutstripped its gain in intrinsic value, even though the latter gain had\nbeen highly satisfactory; (2) that kind of overperformance could not\ncontinue indefinitely; (3) Charlie and I did not at that moment consider\nBerkshire to be undervalued.\n\nSince I set down those cautions, Berkshire's intrinsic value has\nincreased very significantly - aided in a major way by a stunning\nperformance at GEICO that I will tell you more about later - while the\nmarket price of our shares has changed little. This, of course, means\nthat in 1996 B\nerkshire's stock underperformed the business.\nConsequently, today's price/value relationship is both much different\nfrom what it was a year ago and, as Charlie and I see it, more\nappropriate.\n\nOver time, the aggregate gains made by Berkshire shareholders must\nof necessity match the business gains of the company. When the stock\ntemporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number\nof shareholders - either sellers or buyers - receive outsized benefits at\nthe expense of those they trade with. Generally, the sophisticated have\nan edge over the innocents in this game.\n\nThough our primary goal is to maximize the amount that our\nshareholders, in total, reap from their ownership of Berkshire, we wish\nalso to minimize the benefits going to some shareholders at the expense\nof others. These are goals we would have were w\ne managing a family\npartnership, and we believe they make equal sense for the manager of a\npublic company. In a partnership, fairness requires that partnership\ninterests be valued equitably when partners enter or exit; in a public\ncompany, fairness prevails when market price and intrinsic value are in\nsync. Obviously, they won't always meet that ideal, but a manager - by\nhis policies and communications - can do much to foster equity.\n\nOf course, the longer a shareholder holds his shares, the more\nbearing Berkshire's business results will have on his financial\nexperience - and the less it will matter what premium or discoun\nt to\nintrinsic value prevails when he buys and sells his stock. That's one\nreason we hope to attract owners with long-term horizons. Overall, I\nthink we have succeeded in that pursuit. Berkshire probably ranks number\none among large American corporations in the percentage of its shares\nheld by owners with a long-term view.\n\nAcquisitions of 1996\n\nWe made two acquisitions in 1996, both possessing exactly the\nqualities we seek - excellent business economics and an outstanding\nmanager.\n\nThe first acquisition was Kansas Bankers Surety (KBS), an insurance\ncompany whose name describes its specialty. The company, which does\nbusiness in 22 states, has an extraordinary underwriting record, achieved\nthrough the efforts of Don Towle, an extraordinary manager. Don has\ndeveloped first-hand relationships with hundreds of bankers and knows\nevery detail of his operation. He thinks of himself as running a company\nthat is \"his,\" an attitude we treasure at Berkshire\n. Because of its\nrelatively small size, we placed KBS with Wesco, our 80%-owned\nsubsidiary, which has wanted to expand its insurance operations.\n\nYou might be interested in the carefully-crafted and sophisticated\nacquisition strategy that allowed Berkshire to nab this deal. Early in\n1996 I was invited to the 40 th birthday party of my nephew's wife, Jane\nRogers.

He knew our acquisition criteria, and he thought\nthat Al Ueltschi, Flight Safety's 79-year-old CEO, might want to make a\ndeal that would both give him a home for his company and a security in\npayment that he would feel comfortable owning throughout his lifetime.\nSo in July, Richard wrote Bob D\nenham, CEO of Salomon Inc, suggesting that\nhe explore the possibility of a merger.\n\nBob took it from there, and on September 18, Al and I met in New\nYork. I had long been familiar with Flight Safety's business, and in\nabout 60 sec\nonds I knew that Al was exactly our kind of manager. A month\nlater, we had a contract. Because Charlie and I wished to minimize the\nissuance of Berkshire shares, the transaction we structured gave\nFlight Safety shareholders a choice of cash or stock but carried terms\nthat encouraged those who were tax-indifferent to take cash.

The company operates in 41 locations,\noutfitted with 175 simulators of planes ranging from the very small, such\nas Cessna 210 s, to Boeing 747 s.

In both primary\ninsurance, where GEICO is our main unit, and in our \"super-cat\"\nreinsurance business, results were outstanding.\n\nAs we've explained in past reports, what counts in our insurance\nbusiness is, first, the amount of \"float\" we generate and, second, its\ncost to us. These are matters that are important for you to understand\nbecause float is a major component of Berkshire's intrinsic value that is\nnot reflected in book value.\n\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but don't own.

For the table, we have calculated our\nfloat - which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium\nvolume - by adding loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held\nunder reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then\nsubtracting agents' balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes\nand deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. Our cost of\nfloat is determined by our underwriting loss or profit. In those years\nwhen we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last four, our cost\nof float has been negative.

In this operation, we sell policies that insurance\nand reinsurance companies buy to protect themselves from the effects of\nmega-catastrophes. Since truly major catastrophes are rare occurrences,\nour super-cat business can be expected to show large profits in most years\n- and to record a huge loss occasionally. In other words, the\nattractiveness of our super-cat business will take a great many years to\nmeasure.\nWhat you must understand, however, is that a truly terrible year\nin the super-cat business is not a possibility - it's a certainty. The\nonly question is when it will come.\n\nI emphasize this lugubrious point because I would not want you to\npanic and sell your Berkshire stock upon hearing that some large\ncatastrophe had cost us a significant amount. If you would tend to react\nthat way, you should not own Berkshire shares now, just as you should\nentirely avoid owning stocks if a crashing market would lead you to panic\nand sell. Selling fine businesses on \"scary\" news is usually a bad\ndecision. (Robe\nrt Woodruff, the business genius who built Coca-Cola over\nmany decades and who owned a huge position in the company, was once asked\nwhen it might be a good time to sell Coke stock. Woodruff had a simple\nanswer: \"I don't know. I've never sold any.\")\n\nIn our super-cat operation, our customers are insurers that are\nexposed to major earnings volatility and that wish to reduce it. The\nproduct we sell - for what we hope is an appropriate price - is our\nwillingness to shift that volatility to our own b\nooks. Gyrations in\nBerkshire's earnings don't bother us in the least: Charlie and I would\nmuch rather earn a lumpy 15% over time than a smooth 12%.
