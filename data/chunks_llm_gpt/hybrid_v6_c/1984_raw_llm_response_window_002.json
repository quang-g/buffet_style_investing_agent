That day may have arrived. We are almost without\\nquestion the strongest property/casualty insurance operation in\\nthe country, with a capital position far superior to that of\\nwell-known companies of much greater size.\\n\\nEqually important, our corporate policy is to retain that\\nsuperiority. The buyer of insurance receives only a promise in\\nexchange for his cash. The value of that promise should be\\nappraised against the possibility of adversity, not prosperity.\\nAt a minimum, the promise should appear able to withstand a\\nprolonged combination of depressed financial markets and\\nexceptionally unfavorable underwriting results. Our insurance\\nsubsidiaries are both willing and able to keep their promises in\\nany such environment - and not too many other companies clearly\\nare.\\n\\nOur financial strength is a particular asset in the business\\nof structured settlements and loss reserve assumptions that we\\nreported on last year. The claimant in a structured settlement\\nand the insurance company that has reinsured loss reserves need\\nto be completely confident that payments will be forthcoming for\\ndecades to come. Very few companies in the property/casualty\\nfield can meet this test of unquestioned long-term strength. (In\\nfact, only a handful of companies exists with which we will\\nreinsure our own liabilities.)\\n\\nWe have grown in these new lines of business: funds that we\\nhold to offset assumed liabilities grew from $16.2 million to\\n$30.6 million during the year. We expect growth to continue and\\nperhaps to greatly accelerate. To support this projected growth\\nwe have added substantially to the capital of Columbia Insurance\\nCompany, our reinsurance unit specializing in structured\\nsettlements and loss reserve assumptions. While these businesses\\nare very competitive, returns should be satisfactory.\\n\\nAt GEICO the news, as usual, is mostly good. That company\\nachieved excellent unit growth in its primary insurance business\\nduring 1984, and the performance of its investment portfolio\\ncontinued to be extraordinary. Though underwriting results\\ndeteriorated late in the year, they still remain far better than\\nthose of the industry. Our ownership in GEICO at yearend\\namounted to 36% and thus our interest in their direct\\nproperty/casualty volume of $885 million amounted to $320\\nmillion, or well over double our own premium volume.\\n\\nI have reported to you in the past few years that the\\nperformance of GEICOs stock has considerably exceeded that\\ncompanys business performance, brilliant as the latter has been.\\nIn those years, the carrying value of our GEICO investment on our\\nbalance sheet grew at a rate greater than the growth in GEICOs\\nintrinsic business value. I warned you that over performance by\\nthe stock relative to the performance of the business obviously\\ncould not occur every year, and that in some years the stock must\\nunder perform the business. In 1984 that occurred and the\\ncarrying value of our interest in GEICO changed hardly at all,\\nwhile the intrinsic business value of that interest increased\\nsubstantially. Since 27% of Berkshires net worth at the\\nbeginning of 1984 was represented by GEICO, its static market\\nvalue had a significant impact upon our rate of gain for the\\nyear. We are not at all unhappy with such a result: we would far\\nrather have the business value of GEICO increase by X during the\\nyear, while market value decreases, than have the intrinsic value\\nincrease by only 1/2 X with market value soaring. In GEICOs\\ncase, as in all of our investments, we look to business\\nperformance, not market performance. If we are correct in\\nexpectations regarding the business, the market eventually will\\nfollow along.\\n\\nYou, as shareholders of Berkshire, have benefited in\\nenormous measure from the talents of GEICOs Jack Byrne, Bill\\nSnyder, and Lou Simpson. In its core business - low-cost auto\\nand homeowners insurance - GEICO has a major, sustainable\\ncompetitive advantage. That is a rare asset in business\\ngenerally, and its almost non-existent in the field of financial\\nservices. (GEICO, itself, illustrates this point: despite the\\ncompanys excellent management, superior profitability has eluded\\nGEICO in all endeavors other than its core business.) In a large\\nindustry, a competitive advantage such as GEICOs provides the\\npotential for unusual economic rewards, and Jack and Bill\\ncontinue to exhibit great skill in realizing that potential.\\n\\nMost of the funds generated by GEICOs core insurance\\noperation are made available to Lou for investment. Lou has the\\nrare combination of temperamental and intellectual\\ncharacteristics that produce outstanding long-term investment\\nperformance. Operating with below-average risk, he has generated\\nreturns that have been by far the best in the insurance industry.\\nI applaud and appreciate the efforts and talents of these three\\noutstanding managers.\\n\\nErrors in Loss Reserving\\n\\nAny shareholder in a company with important interests in the\\nproperty/casualty insurance business should have some\\nunderstanding of the weaknesses inherent in the reporting of\\ncurrent earnings in that industry. Phil Graham, when publisher\\nof the Washington Post, described the daily newspaper as a first\\nrough draft of history. Unfortunately, the financial statements\\nof a property/casualty insurer provide, at best, only a first\\nrough draft of earnings and financial condition.\\n\\nThe determination of costs is the main problem. Most of an\\ninsurers costs result from losses on claims, and many of the\\nlosses that should be charged against the current years revenue\\nare exceptionally difficult to estimate. Sometimes the extent of\\nthese losses, or even their existence, is not known for decades.\\n\\nThe loss expense charged in a property/casualty companys\\ncurrent income statement represents: (1) losses that occurred and\\nwere paid during the year; (2) estimates for losses that occurred\\nand were reported to the insurer during the year, but which have\\nyet to be settled; (3) estimates of ultimate dollar costs for\\nlosses that occurred during the year but of which the insurer is\\nunaware (termed IBNR: incurred but not reported); and (4) the\\nnet effect of revisions this year of similar estimates for (2)\\nand (3) made in past years.\\n\\nSuch revisions may be long delayed, but eventually any\\nestimate of losses that causes the income for year X to be\\nmisstated must be corrected, whether it is in year X + 1, or\\nX + 10. This, perforce, means that earnings in the year of\\ncorrection also are misstated. For example, assume a claimant\\nwas injured by one of our insureds in 1979 and we thought a\\nsettlement was likely to be made for $10,000. That year we would\\nhave charged $10,000 to our earnings statement for the estimated\\ncost of the loss and, correspondingly, set up a liability reserve\\non the balance sheet for that amount. If we settled the claim in\\n1984 for $100,000, we would charge earnings with a loss cost of\\n$90,000 in 1984, although that cost was truly an expense of 1979.\\nAnd if that piece of business was our only activity in 1979, we\\nwould have badly misled ourselves as to costs, and you as to\\nearnings.\\n\\nThe necessarily-extensive use of estimates in assembling the\\nfigures that appear in such deceptively precise form in the\\nincome statement of property/casualty companies means that some\\nerror must seep in, no matter how proper the intentions of\\nmanagement. In an attempt to minimize error, most insurers use\\nvarious statistical techniques to adjust the thousands of\\nindividual loss evaluations (called case reserves) that comprise\\nthe raw data for estimation of aggregate liabilities. The extra\\nreserves created by these adjustments are variously labeled\\nbulk, development, or supplemental reserves. The goal of\\nthe adjustments should be a loss-reserve total that has a 50-50\\nchance of being proved either slightly too high or slightly too\\nlow when all losses that occurred prior to the date of the\\nfinancial statement are ultimately paid.\\n\\nAt Berkshire, we have added what we thought were appropriate\\nsupplemental reserves but in recent years they have not been\\nadequate. It is important that you understand the magnitude of\\nthe errors that have been involved in our reserving. You can\\nthus see for yourselves just how imprecise the process is, and\\nalso judge whether we may have some systemic bias that should\\nmake you wary of our current and future figures.\\n\\nThe following table shows the results from insurance\\nunderwriting as we have reported them to you in recent years, and\\nalso gives you calculations a year later on an if-we-knew-thenwhat-we think-we-know-now basis. I say what we think we know\\nnow because the adjusted figures still include a great many\\nestimates for losses that occurred in the earlier years.\\nHowever, many claims from the earlier years have been settled so\\nthat our one-year-later estimate contains less guess work than\\nour earlier estimate:\\n\\nUnderwriting Results Corrected Figures\\nas Reported After One Years\\nYear to You Experience\\n---- -------------------- -----------------\\n\\n1980 $ 6,738,000 $ 14,887,000\\n1981 1,478,000 (1,118,000)\\n1982 (21,462,000) (25,066,000)\\n1983 (33,192,000) (50,974,000)\\n1984 (45,413,000) ?\\n\\nOur structured settlement and loss-reserve assumption\\nbusinesses are not included in this table. Important\\nadditional information on loss reserve experience appears\\non pages 43-45.\\n\\nTo help you understand this table, here is an explanation of\\nthe most recent figures: 1984 s reported pre-tax underwriting\\nloss of $45.4 million consists of $27.6 million we estimate that\\nwe lost on 1984 s business, plus the increased loss of $17.8\\nmillion reflected in the corrected figure for 1983.\\n\\nAs you can see from reviewing the table, my errors in\\nreporting to you have been substantial and recently have always\\npresented a better underwriting picture than was truly the case.\\nThis is a source of particular chagrin to me because: (1) I like\\nfor you to be able to count on what I say; (2) our insurance\\nmanagers and I undoubtedly acted with less urgency than we would\\nhave had we understood the full extent of our losses; and (3) we\\npaid income taxes calculated on overstated earnings and thereby\\ngave the government money that we didnt need to. (These\\noverpayments eventually correct themselves, but the delay is long\\nand we dont receive interest on the amounts we overpaid.)\\n\\nBecause our business is weighted toward casualty and\\nreinsurance lines, we have more problems in estimating loss costs\\nthan companies that specialize in property insurance. (When a\\nbuilding that you have insured burns down, you get a much faster\\nfix on your costs than you do when an employer you have insured\\nfinds out that one of his retirees has contracted a disease\\nattributable to work he did decades earlier.) But I still find\\nour errors embarrassing. In our direct business, we have far\\nunderestimated the mushrooming tendency of juries and courts to\\nmake the deep pocket pay, regardless of the factual situation\\nand the past precedents for establishment of liability. We also\\nhave underestimated the contagious effect that publicity\\nregarding giant awards has on juries. In the reinsurance area,\\nwhere we have had our worst experience in under reserving, our\\ncustomer insurance companies have made the same mistakes. Since\\nwe set reserves based on information they supply us, their\\nmistakes have become our mistakes.\\n\\nI heard a story recently that is applicable to our insurance\\naccounting problems: a man was traveling abroad when he received\\na call from his sister informing him that their father had died\\nunexpectedly. It was physically impossible for the brother to\\nget back home for the funeral, but he told his sister to take\\ncare of the funeral arrangements and to send the bill to him.\\nAfter returning home he received a bill for several thousand\\ndollars, which he promptly paid. The following month another\\nbill came along for $15, and he paid that too. Another month\\nfollowed, with a similar bill. When, in the next month, a third\\nbill for $15 was presented, he called his sister to ask what was\\ngoing on. Oh, she said. I forgot to tell you. We buried Dad\\nin a rented suit.\\n\\nIf youve been in the insurance business in recent years -\\nparticularly the reinsurance business - this story hurts. We\\nhave tried to include all of our rented suit liabilities in our\\ncurrent financial statement, but our record of past error should\\nmake us humble, and you suspicious. I will continue to report to\\nyou the errors, plus or minus, that surface each year.\\n\\nNot all reserving errors in the industry have been of the\\ninnocent-but-dumb variety. With underwriting results as bad as\\nthey have been in recent years - and with managements having as\\nmuch discretion as they do in the presentation of financial\\nstatements - some unattractive aspects of human nature have\\nmanifested themselves. Companies that would be out of business if they realistically appraised their loss costs have, in some\\ncases, simply preferred to take an extraordinarily optimistic\\nview about these yet-to-be-paid sums. Others have engaged in\\nvarious transactions to hide true current loss costs.\\n\\nBoth of these approaches can work for a considerable time:\\nexternal auditors cannot effectively police the financial\\nstatements of property/casualty insurers. If liabilities of an\\ninsurer, correctly stated, would exceed assets, it falls to the\\ninsurer to volunteer this morbid information. In other words,\\nthe corpse is supposed to file the death certificate. Under this\\nhonor system of mortality, the corpse sometimes gives itself\\nthe benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nIn most businesses, of course, insolvent companies run out\\nof cash. Insurance is different: you can be broke but flush.\\nSince cash comes in at the inception of an insurance policy and\\nlosses are paid much later, insolvent insurers dont run out of\\ncash until long after they have run out of net worth. In fact,\\nthese walking dead often redouble their efforts to write\\nbusiness, accepting almost any price or risk, simply to keep the\\ncash flowing in. With an attitude like that of an embezzler who\\nhas gambled away his purloined funds, these companies hope that\\nsomehow they can get lucky on the next batch of business and\\nthereby cover up earlier shortfalls. Even if they dont get\\nlucky, the penalty to managers is usually no greater for a $100\\nmillion shortfall than one of $10 million; in the meantime, while\\nthe losses mount, the managers keep their jobs and perquisites.\\n\\nThe loss-reserving errors of other property/casualty\\ncompanies are of more than academic interest to Berkshire. Not\\nonly does Berkshire suffer from sell-at-any-price competition by\\nthe walking dead, but we also suffer when their insolvency is\\nfinally acknowledged. Through various state guarantee funds that\\nlevy assessments, Berkshire ends up paying a portion of the\\ninsolvent insurers asset deficiencies, swollen as they usually\\nare by the delayed detection that results from wrong reporting.\\nThere is even some potential for cascading trouble. The\\ninsolvency of a few large insurers and the assessments by state\\nguarantee funds that would follow could imperil weak-butpreviously-solvent insurers. Such dangers can be mitigated if\\nstate regulators become better at prompt identification and\\ntermination of insolvent insurers, but progress on that front has\\nbeen slow.\\n\\nWashington Public Power Supply System\\n\\nFrom October, 1983 through June, 1984 Berkshires insurance\\nsubsidiaries continuously purchased large quantities of bonds of\\nProjects 1,2, and 3 of Washington Public Power Supply System\\n(WPPSS). This is the same entity that, on July 1,1983,\\ndefaulted on $2.2 billion of bonds issued to finance partial\\nconstruction of the now-abandoned Projects 4 and 5. While there\\nare material differences in the obligors, promises, and\\nproperties underlying the two categories of bonds, the problems\\nof Projects 4 and 5 have cast a major cloud over Projects 1,2,\\nand 3, and might possibly cause serious problems for the latter\\nissues. In addition, there have been a multitude of problems\\nrelated directly to Projects 1,2, and 3 that could weaken or\\ndestroy an otherwise strong credit position arising from\\nguarantees by Bonneville Power Administration.\\n\\nDespite these important negatives, Charlie and I judged the\\nrisks\\nat the time we purchased the bonds and at the prices\\nBerkshire paid\\n(much lower than present prices) to be\\nconsiderably more than compensated for by prospects of profit.\\n\\nAs you know, we buy marketable stocks for our insurance\\ncompanies based upon the criteria we would apply in the purchase\\nof an entire business. This business-valuation approach is not\\nwidespread among professional money managers and is scorned by\\nmany academics. Nevertheless, it has served its followers well\\n(to which the academics seem to say, Well, it may be all right\\nin practice, but it will never work in theory.) Simply put, we\\nfeel that if we can buy small pieces of businesses with\\nsatisfactory underlying economics at a fraction of the per-share\\nvalue of the entire business, something good is likely to happen\\nto us - particularly if we own a group of such securities.\", \"end_anchor\": \"business-valuation approach is not\\nwidespread among professional money managers and is scorned by\\nmany academics.
