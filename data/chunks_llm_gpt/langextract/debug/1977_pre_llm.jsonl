Of\nthese earnings, $1.43 per share resulted from substantial\nrealized capital gains by Blue Chip Stamps which, to the extent\nof our proportional interest in that company, are included in our\noperating earnings figure. Capital gains or losses realized\ndirectly by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. or its insurance subsidiaries\nare not included in our calculation of operating earnings. While\ntoo much attention should not be paid to the figure for any\nsingle year, over the longer term the record regarding aggregate\ncapital gains or losses obviously is of significance.\n\nTextile operations came in well below forecast, while the\nresults of the Illinois National Bank as well as the operating\nearnings attributable to our equity interest in Blue Chip Stamps\nwere about as anticipated. However, insurance operations, led\nagain by the truly outstanding results of Phil Liesches\nmanagerial group at National Indemnity Company, were even better\nthan our optimistic expectations.\n\nMost companies define record earnings as a new high in\nearnings per share. Since businesses customarily add from year\nto year to their equity base, we find nothing particularly\nnoteworthy in a management performance combining, say, a 10%\nincrease in equity capital and a 5% increase in earnings per\nshare. After all, even a totally dormant savings account will\nproduce steadily rising interest earnings each year because of\ncompounding.\n\nExcept for special cases (for example, companies with\nunusual debt-equity ratios or those with important assets carried\nat unrealistic balance sheet values), we believe a more\nappropriate measure of managerial economic performance to be\nreturn on equity capital. In 1977 our operating earnings on\nbeginning equity capital amounted to 19%, slightly better than\nlast year and above both our own long-term average and that of\nAmerican industry in aggregate.

It was early in 1967 that we made our entry into this\nindustry through the purchase of National Indemnity Company and\nNational Fire and Marine Insurance Company (sister companies) for\napproximately $8.6 million. In that year their premium volume\namounted to $22 million. In 1977 our aggregate insurance premium\nvolume was $151 million. No additional shares of Berkshire\nHathaway stock have been issued to achieve any of this growth.\n\nRather, this almost 600% increase has been achieved through\nlarge gains in National Indemnitys traditional liability areas\nplus the starting of new companies (Cornhusker Casualty Company\nin 1970, Lakeland Fire and Casualty Company in 1971, Texas United\nInsurance Company in 1972, The Insurance Company of Iowa in 1973,\nand Kansas Fire and Casualty Company in late 1977), the purchase\nfor cash of other insurance companies (Home and Automobile\nInsurance Company in 1971, Kerkling Reinsurance Corporation, now\nnamed Central Fire and Casualty Company, in 1976, and Cypress\nInsurance Company at yearend 1977), and finally through the\nmarketing of additional products, most significantly reinsurance,\nwithin the National Indemnity Company corporate structure.\n\nIn aggregate, the insurance business has worked out very\nwell. But it hasnt been a one-way street. Some major mistakes\nhave been made during the decade, both in products and personnel.\nWe experienced significant problems from (1) a surety operation\ninitiated in 1969, (2) the 1973 expansion of Home and\nAutomobiles urban auto marketing into the Miami, Florida area,\n(3) a still unresolved aviation fronting arrangement, and (4)\nour Workers Compensation operation in California, which we\nbelieve retains an interesting potential upon completion of a\nreorganization now in progress. It is comforting to be in a\nbusiness where some mistakes can be made and yet a quite\nsatisfactory overall performance can be achieved. In a sense,\nthis is the opposite case from our textile business where even\nvery good management probably can average only modest results.\nOne of the lessons your management has learned - and,\nunfortunately, sometimes re-learned - is the importance of being\nin businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds.", "word_count": 351, "char_count": 2312, "chunk_type": "narrative", "has_financials": true, "has_table": false, "has_quote": false, "contains_principle": false, "contains_example": false, "contains_comparison": false, "contextual_summary": null, "prev_context": null, "next_context": null, "topics": [], "companies_mentioned": [], "people_mentioned": [], "metrics_discussed": [], "industries": [], "principle_category": null, "principle_statement": null, "retrieval_priority": "medium", "abstraction_level": "medium", "time_sensitivity": "low", "is_complete_thought": true, "needs_context": false}

We\nestimate that costs involved in the insurance areas in which we\noperate rise at close to 1% per month. This is due to continuous\nmonetary inflation affecting the cost of repairing humans and\nproperty, as well as social inflation, a broadening definition\nby society and juries of what is covered by insurance policies.\nUnless rates rise at a comparable 1% per month, underwriting\nprofits must shrink. Recently the pace of rate increases has\nslowed dramatically, and it is our expectation that underwriting\nmargins generally will be declining by the second half of the\nyear.\n\nWe must again give credit to Phil Liesche, greatly assisted\nby Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims, for an\nextraordinary underwriting achievement in National Indemnitys\ntraditional auto and general liability business during 1977.\nLarge volume gains have been accompanied by excellent\nunderwriting margins following contraction or withdrawal by many\ncompetitors in the wake of the 1974-75 crisis period.
