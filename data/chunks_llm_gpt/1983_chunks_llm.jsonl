Most of this growth resulted from our\nmerger with Blue Chip Stamps, but there also was an acceleration\nin the pace of natural increase that has raised us from the\n1000 level a few years ago.\n\nWith so many new shareholders, its appropriate to summarize\nthe major business principles we follow that pertain to the\nmanager-owner relationship:\n\no\nAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is\npartnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as\nowner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because\nof the size of our shareholdings we also are, for better or\nworse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself\nas the ultimate owner of our business assets but, instead, view\nthe company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the\nassets.\n\no\nIn line with this owner-orientation, our directors are all\nmajor shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. In the case of at\nleast four of the five, over 50% of family net worth is\nrepresented by holdings of Berkshire. We eat our own cooking.\n\no\nOur long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications\nmentioned later) is to maximize the average annual rate of gain\nin intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not\nmeasure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by\nits size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that\nthe rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a\ngreatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be\ndisappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average\nlarge American corporation.\n\no\nOur preference would be to reach this goal by directly\nowning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and\nconsistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second\nchoice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily\nthrough purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance\nsubsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the\nneed for insurance capital determine any given years capital\nallocation.\n\no\nBecause of this two-pronged approach to business ownership\nand because of the limitations of conventional accounting,\nconsolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about\nour true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and\nmanagers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However,\nwe will also report to you the earnings of each major business we\ncontrol, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures,\nalong with other information we will supply about the individual\nbusinesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about\nthem.\n\no\nAccounting consequences do not influence our operating or\ncapital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are\nsimilar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not\nreportable by us under standard accounting principles than to\npurchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely\nthe choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose\nearnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the\npro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely\nunreportable).

She had no\nformal education, not even at the grammar school level, and knew\nno English. After some years in this country, she learned the\nlanguage when her older daughter taught her, every evening, the\nwords she had learned in school during the day.\n\nIn 1937, after many years\nof selling used clothing, Mrs.\nBlumkin had saved $500 with which to realize her dream of opening\na furniture store. Upon seeing the American Furniture Mart in\nChicago - then the center of the nations wholesale furniture\nactivity - she decided to christen her dream Nebraska Furniture\nMart.\n\nShe met every obstacle you would expect (and a few you\nwouldnt) when a business endowed with only $500 and no\nlocational or product advantage goes up against rich, lo\nngentrenched competition. At one early point, when her tiny\nresources ran out, Mrs. B (a personal trademark now as well\nrecognized in Greater Omaha as Coca-Cola or Sanka) coped in a way\nnot taught at business schools: she simply sold the furniture and\nappliances from her home in order to pay creditors precisely as\npromised.\n\nOmaha retailers began to recognize that Mrs. B would offer\ncustomers far better deals than they had been giving, and they\npressured furniture and carpet manufacturers not to sell to her.\nBut by various strategies she obtained merchandise and cut prices\nsharply. Mrs. B was then hauled into court for violation of Fair\nTrade laws. She not only won all th\ne cases, but received\ninvaluable publicity. At the end of one case, after\ndemonstrating to the court that she could profitably sell carpet\nat a huge discount from the prevailing price, she sold the judge\n$1400 worth of carpet.\n\nToday Nebraska Furniture Mart generates over $100 million of\nsales annually out of one 200,000 square-foot store. No other\nhome furnishings store in the country comes close to that volume.\nThat single store also sells more furniture, carpets, and\nappliances than do all Omaha competitors combined.\n\nOne question I always ask myself in appraising a business is\nhow I would like, assuming I had ample capital and skilled\npersonnel, to compete with it. Id rather wrestle grizzlies than\ncompete with Mrs. B and her progeny. They buy brilliantly, they\noperate at expense ratios competitors dont even dream about, and\nthey then pass on to their customers much of the savings. Its\nthe ideal business - one built upon exceptional value to the\ncustomer that in turn translates into exceptional economics for\nits owners.\n\nMrs. B is wise as well as smart and, for far-sighted family\nreasons, was willing to sell the business last year. I had\nadmired both the family and the business for decades, and a deal\nwas quickly made. But Mrs. B, now 90, is not one to go home and\nrisk, as she puts it, losing her marbles. She remains Chairman\nand is on the sales floor seven days a week. Carpet sales are\nher specialty. She personally sells quantities that would be a\ngood departmental total for other carpet retailers.\n\nWe purchased 90% of the business - leaving 10% with members\nof the family who are involved in management - and have optioned\n10% to certain key young family managers.\n\nAnd what managers they are. Geneticists should do\nhandsprings over the Blumkin family. Louie Blumkin, Mrs. Bs\nson, has been President of Nebraska Furniture Mart for many years\nand is widely regarded as the shrewdest buyer of furniture and\nappliances in the country. Louie says he had the best teacher,\nand Mrs. B says she had the best student. Theyre both right.\nLouie and\nhis three sons all have the Blumkin business ability,\nwork ethic, and, most important, character. On top of that, they\nare really nice people. We are delighted to be in partnership\nwith them.\n\nCorporate Performance\n\nDuring 1983 our book value increased from $737.43 per share\nto $975.83 per share, or by 32%. We never take the one-year\nfigure very seriously. After all, why should the time required\nfor a planet to circle the sun synchronize precisely with the\ntime required for business actions to pay off? Instead, we\nrecommend not less than a five-year test as a rough yardstick of\neconomic performance. Red lights should start flashing if the\nfive-year average annual gain falls much below the return on\nequity earned over the period by American industry in aggregate.\n(Watch out for our explanation if that occurs as Goethe observed,\nWhen ideas fail, words come in very handy.)\n\nDuring the 19-year tenure of present management, book value\nhas grown from $19.46 per share to $975.83, or 22.6% compounded\nannually. Considering our present size, nothing close to this\nrate of return can be sustained. Those who believe otherwise\nshould pursue a career in sales, but avoid one in mathematics.\n\nWe report our progress in terms of book value because in our\ncase (though not, by any means, in all cases) it is a\nconservative but reasonably adequate proxy for growth in\nintrinsic business value -\nthe measurement that really counts.\n\nBook values virtue as a score-keeping measure is that it is easy\nto calculate and doesnt involve the subjective (but important)\njudgments employed in calculation of intr", "char_count": 5729, "word_count": 977, "position_in_letter": 0.10319971621142249, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}

Intrinsic business value is an economic\nconcept, estimating future cash output discounted to present\nvalue. Book value tells you what has been put in; intrinsic\nbusiness value estimates what can be taken out.\n\nAn analogy will suggest the difference. Assume you spend\nidentical amounts putting each of two children through college.\nThe book value (measured by financial input) of each childs\neducation would be the same. But the present value of the future\npayoff (the intrinsic business value) might vary enormously -\nfrom zero to many times the cost of the education. So, also, do\nbusinesses having equal financial input end up with wide\nvariations in value.\n\nAt Berkshire, at the beginning of fiscal 1965 when the\npresent management took over, the $19.46 per share book value\nconsiderably overstated intrinsic business value. All of that\nbook value consisted o\nf textile assets that could not earn, on\naverage, anything close to an appropriate rate of return. In the\nterms of our analogy, the investment in textile assets resembled\ninvestment in a largely-wasted education.\n\nNow, however, our intrinsic business value considerably\nexceeds book value. There are two major reasons:\n\n(1) Standard accounting principles require that common\nstocks held by our insurance subsidiaries be stated on\nour books at market value, but that other stocks we own\nbe carried at\nthe lower of aggregate cost or market.\nAt the end of 1983, the market value of this latter\ngroup exceeded carrying value by $70 million pre-tax,\nor about $50 million after tax. This excess belongs in\nour intrinsic business value, but is not included in\nthe calculation of book value;\n\n(2) More important, we own several businesses that possess\neconomic Goodwill (which is properly includable in\nintrinsic business value) far larger than the\naccounting Goodwill that is carried on our balance\nsheet and reflected in book value.\n\nGoodwill, both economic and accounting, is an arcane subject\nand requires more explanation than is appropriate here. The\nappendix that follows this letter - Goodwill and its\nAmortization: The Rules and The Realities - explains why\neconomic and accounting Goodwill can, and usually do, differ\nenormously.\n\nYou can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking\nabout Goodwill and its amortization. But students of investment\nand management should understand the nuances of the subject. My\nown thinking has changed drastically from 35 years ago when I was\ntaught to favor tangible assets and to shun businesses whose\nvalue depended largely upon economic Goodwill. This bias caused\nme to make many important business mistakes of omission, although\nrelatively few of commission.\n\nKeynes identified my problem: The difficulty lies not in\nthe new ideas but in escaping from the old ones. My escape was\nlong delayed, in part because most of what I had been taught by\nthe same teacher had been (and continues to be) so\nextraordinarily valuable. Ultimately, business experience,\ndirect and vicarious, produced my present strong preference for\nbusinesses that possess large amounts of enduring Goodwill and\nthat utilize a minimum of tangible assets.\n\nI recommend the Appendix to those who are comfortable with\naccounting terminology and who have an interest in understanding\nthe business aspects of Goodwill. Whether or not you wish to\ntackle the Appendix, you should be aware that Charlie and I\nbelieve that Berkshire possesses very significant economic\nGoodwill value above that reflected in our book value.\n\nSources of Reported Earnings\n\nThe table below shows the sources of Berkshires reported\nearnings. In 1982, Berkshire owned about 60% of Blue Chip Stamps\nwhereas, in 1983, our ownership was 60% throughout the first six\nmonths and 100% thereafter. In turn, Berkshires net interest in\nWesco was 48% during 1982 and the first six months of 1983, and\n80% for the balance of 1983.

Charlie replaced\nLouie Vincenti as Chairman of Wesco late in 1983 when health\nforced Louies retirement at age 77. In some instances, health\nis a euphemism, but in Louies case nothing but health would\ncause us to consider his retirement. Louie is a marvelous man\nand has been a marvelous manager.\n\nThe special GEICO distribution reported in the table arose\nwhen that company made a tender offer for a portion of its stock,\nbuying both from us and other shareholders. At GEICOs request,\nwe tendered a quantity of shares that kept our ownership\npercentage the same after the transaction as before. The\nproportional nature of our sale permitted us to treat the\nproceeds as a dividend. Unlike individuals, corporations net\nconsiderably more when earnings are derived from dividends rather\nthan from capital gains, since the effective Federal income tax\nrate on dividends is 6.9% versus 28% on capital gains.\n\nEven with this special item added in, our total dividends\nfrom GEICO in 1983 were considerably less than our share of\nGEICOs earnings. Thus it is perfectly appropriate, from both an\naccounting and economic standpoint, to include the redemption\nproceeds in our reported earnings. It is because the item is\nlarge and unusual that we call your attention to it.\n\nThe table showing you our sources of earnings includes\ndividends from those non-controlled companies whose marketable\nequity securities we own. But the table does not include\nearnings those companies have retained that are applicable to our\nownership. In aggregate and over time we expect those\nundistributed earnings to be reflected in market prices and to\nincrease our intrinsic business value on a dollar-for-dollar\nbasis, just as if those earnings had been under our control and\nreported as part of our profits. That does not mean we expect\nall of our holdings to behave uniformly; some will disappoint us,\nothers will deliver pleasant surprises. To date our experience\nhas been better than we originally anticipated, In aggregate, we\nhave received far more than a dollar of market value gain for\nevery dollar of earnings retained.\n\nThe following table shows our 1983 yearend net holdings in\nmarketable equities. All numbers represent 100% of Berkshires\nholdings, and 80% of Wescos holdings. The portion attributable\nto minority shareholders of Wesco has been excluded.\n\nNo. of Shares Cost Market\n------------- ---------- ----------\n(000 s omitted)\n\n690,975 Affiliated Publications, Inc. .... $ 3,516 $ 26,603\n4,451,544 General Foods Corporation(a) ..... 163,786 228,698\n6,850,000 GEICO Corporation ................ 47,138 398,156\n2,379,200 Handy & Harman ................... 27,318 42,231\n636,310 Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. 4,056 33,088\n197,200 Media General .................... 3,191 11,191\n250,400 Ogilvy & Mather International .... 2,580 12,833\n5,618,661 R.

We can also\nmake a very rough guess about the earnings this group will retain\nthat will be attributable to our ownership: these may total about\n$65 million for the year. These retained earnings could well\nhave no immediate effect on market prices of the securities.\nOver time, however, we feel they will have real meaning.\n\nIn addition to the figures already supplied, information\nregarding the businesses we control appears in Managements\nDiscussion on pages 40-44. The most significant of these are\nBuffalo Evening News, Sees, and the Insurance Group, to which we\nwill give some special attention here.\n\nBuffalo Evening News\n\nFirst, a clarification: our corporate name is Buffalo\nEvening News, Inc. but the name of the newspaper, since we began\na morning edition a little over a year ago, is Buffalo News.\n\nIn 1983 the News somewhat exceeded its targeted profit\nmargin of 10% after tax. Two factors were responsible: (1) a\nstate income tax cost that was subnormal because of a large loss\ncarry-forward, now fully utilized, and (2) a large drop in the\nper-ton cost of newsprint (an unanticipated fluke that will be\nreversed in 1984).\n\nAlthough our profit margins in 1983 were about average for\nnewsp", "char_count": 7401, "word_count": 1118, "position_in_letter": 0.2440581766583895, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}
