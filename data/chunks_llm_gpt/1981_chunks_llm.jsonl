We expect this\nsituation will continue. In just four ownership positions in\nthis category - GEICO Corporation, General Foods Corporation, R.\nJ. Reynolds Industries, Inc. and The Washington Post Company -\nour share of undistributed and therefore unrecorded earnings\nprobably will total well over $35 million in 1982. The\naccounting rules that entirely ignore these undistributed\nearnings diminish the utility of our annual return on equity\ncalculation, or any other single year measure of economic\nperformance.\n\nLong-Term Corporate Performance\n\nIn measuring long-term economic performance, equities held\nby our insurance subsidiaries are valued at market subject to a\ncharge reflecting the amount of taxes that would have to be paid\nif unrealized gains were actually realized. If we are correct in\nthe premise stressed in the preceding section of this report, our\nunreported ownership earnings will find their way, irregularly\nbut inevitably, into our net worth. To date, this has been the\ncase.\n\nAn even purer calculation of performance would involve a\nvaluation of bonds and non-insurance held equities at market.\nHowever, GAAP accounting does not prescribe this procedure, and\nthe added purity would change results only very slightly. Should\nany valuation difference widen to significant proportions, as it\nhas at most major insurance companies, we will report its effect\nto you.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, during the present managements term of\nseventeen years, book value has increased from $19.46 per share\nto $526.02 per share, or 21.1% compounded annually. This rate of\nreturn number is highly likely to drift downward in future years.\nWe hope, however, that it can be maintained significantly above\nthe rate of return achieved by the average large American\ncorporation.\n\nOver half of the large gain in Berkshires net worth during\n1981 - it totaled $124 million, or about 31% - resulted from the\nmarket performance of a single investment, GEICO Corporation. In\naggregate, our market gain from securities during the year\nconsiderably outstripped the gain in underlying business values.\nSuch market variations will not always be on the pleasant side.\n\nIn past reports we have explained how inflation has caused\nour apparently satisfactory long-term corporate performance to be\nillusory as a measure of true investment results for our owners.\nWe applaud the efforts of Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker and\nnote the currently more moderate increases in various price\nindices. Nevertheless, our views regarding long-term\ninflationary trends are as negative as ever.

Furthermore, the case says\nthat since the equity capital position is associated with greater\nrisk than passive forms of investment, it is entitled to higher\nreturns. A value-added bonus from equity capital seems natural\nand certain.\n\nBut is it? Several decades back, a return on equity of as\nlittle as 10% enabled a corporation to be classified as a good\nbusiness - i. e., one in which a dollar reinvested in the business\nlogically could be expected to be valued by the market at more\nthan one hundred cents. For, with long-term taxable bonds\nyielding 5% and long-term tax-exempt bonds 3%, a business\noperation that could utilize equity capital at 10% clearly was\nworth some premium to investors over the equity capital employed.\nThat was true even though a combination of taxes on dividends and\non capital gains would reduce the 10% earned by the corporation\nto perhaps 6%-8% in the hands of the individual investor.\n\nInvestment markets recognized this truth. During that\nearlier period, American business earned an average of 11% or so\non equity capital employed and stocks, in aggregate, sold at\nvaluations far above that equity capital (book value), averaging\nover 150 cents on the dollar. Most businesses were good\nbusinesses because they earned far more than their keep (the\nreturn on long-term passive money). The value-added produced by\nequity investment, in aggregate, was substantial.\n\nThat day is gone. But the lessons learned during its\nexistence are difficult to discard. While investors and managers\nmust place their feet in the future, their memories and nervous\nsystems often remain plugged into the past. It is much easier\nfor investors to utilize historic p/e ratios or for managers to\nutilize historic business valuation yardsticks than it is for\neither group to rethink their premises daily. When change is\nslow, constant rethinking is actually undesirable; it achieves\nlittle and slows response time. But when change is great,\nyesterdays assumptions can be retained only at great cost. And\nthe pace of economic change has become breathtaking.\n\nDuring the past year, long-term taxable bond yields exceeded\n16% and long-term tax-exempts 14%. The total return achieved\nfrom such tax-exempts, of course, goes directly into the pocket\nof the individual owner. Meanwhile, American business is\nproducing earnings of only about 14% on equity. And this 14%\nwill be substantially reduced by taxation before it can be banked\nby the individual owner. The extent of such shrinkage depends\nupon the dividend policy of the corporation and the tax rates\napplicable to the investor.\n\nThus,\nwith interest rates on passive investments at late\n1981 levels,\na typical American business is no longer worth one\nhundred cents on the dollar to owners who are individuals. (If\nthe business is owned by pension funds or other tax-exempt\ninvestors, the arithmetic, although still unenticing, changes\nsubstantially for the better.) Assume an investor in a 50% tax\nbracket; if our typical company pays out all earnings, the income\nreturn to the investor will be equivalent to that from a 7% taxexempt bond. And, if conditions persist - if all earnings are\npaid out and return on equity stays at 14% - the 7% tax-exempt\nequivalent to the higher-bracket individual investor is just as\nfrozen as is the coupon on a tax-exempt bond. Such a perpetual\n7% tax-exempt bond might be worth fifty cents on the dollar as\nthis is written.\n\nIf, on the other hand, all earnings of our typical American\nbusiness are retained and return on equity again remains\nconstant, earnings will grow at 14% per year. If the p/e ratio\nremains constant, the price of our typical stock will also grow\nat 14% per year. But that 14% is not yet in the pocket of the\nshareholder. Putting it there will require the payment of a\ncapital gains tax, presently assessed at a maximum rate of 20%.\nThis net return, of course, works out to a poorer rate of return\nthan the currently available passive after-tax rate.\n\nUnless passive rates fall, companies achieving 14% per year\ngains in earnings per share while paying no cash dividend are an\neconomic failure for their individual shareholders. The returns\nfrom passive capital outstrip the returns from active capital.\nThis is an unpleasant fact for both investors and corporate\nmanagers and, therefore, one they may wish to ignore. But facts\ndo not cease to exist, either because they are unpleasant or\nbecause they are ignored.\n\nMost American businesses pay out a significant portion of\ntheir earnings and thus fall between the two examples. And most\nAmerican businesses are currently bad businesses economically -\nproducing less for their individual investors after-tax than the\ntax-exempt passive rate of return on money. Of course, some\nhigh-return businesses still remain attractive, even under\npresent conditions. But American equity capital, in aggregate,\nproduces no value-added for individual investors.\n\nIt should be stressed that this depressing situation does\nnot occur because corporations are jumping, economically, less\nhigh than previously. In fact, they are jumping somewhat higher:\nreturn on equity has improved a few points in the past decade.\nBut the crossbar of passive return has been elevated much faster.\nUnhappily, most companies can do little but hope that the bar\nwill be lowered significantly; there are few industries in which\nthe prospects seem bright for substantial gains in return on\nequity.\n\nInflationary experience and expectations will be major (but\nnot the only) factors affecting the height of the crossbar in\nfuture years.
