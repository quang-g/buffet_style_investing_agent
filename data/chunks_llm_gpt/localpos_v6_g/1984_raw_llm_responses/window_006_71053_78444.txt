    "chunk_text": "ire earnings, we almost certainly would have no\nearnings at all now - and perhaps no capital as well. The three\ncompanies each originally made their money from a single\nbusiness: (1) textiles at Berkshire; (2) department stores at\nDiversified; and (3) trading stamps at Blue Chip. These\ncornerstone businesses (carefully chosen, it should be noted, by\nyour Chairman and Vice Chairman) have, respectively, (1) survived\nbut earned almost nothing, (2) shriveled in size while incurring\nlarge losses, and (3) shrunk in sales volume to about 5% its size\nat the time of our entry. (Who says you cant lose em all?)\nOnly by committing available funds to much better businesses were\nwe able to overcome these origins. (Its been like overcoming a\nmisspent youth.) Clearly, diversification has served us well.\n\nWe expect to continue to diversify while also supporting the\ngrowth of current operations though, as weve pointed out, our\nreturns from these efforts will surely be below our historical\nreturns. But as long as prospective returns are above the rate\nrequired to produce a dollar of market value per dollar retained,\nwe will continue to retain all earnings. Should our estimate of\nfuture returns fall below that point, we will distribute all\nunrestricted earnings that we believe can not be effectively\nused. In making that judgment, we will look at both our\nhistorical record and our prospects. Because our year-to-year\nresults are inherently volatile, we believe a five-year rolling\naverage to be appropriate for judging the historical record.\n\nOur present plan is to use our retained earnings to further\nbuild the capital of our insurance companies. Most of our\ncompetitors are in weakened financial condition and reluctant to\nexpand substantially. Yet large premium-volume gains for the\nindustry are imminent, amounting probably to well over $15\nbillion in 1985 versus less than $5 billion in 1983. These\ncircumstances could produce major amounts of profitable business\nfor us. Of course, this result is no sure thing, but prospects\nfor it are far better than they have been for many years.",

We immediately pursued this idea, and only\na chance complication prevented a deal. Since our ad is pulling,\nwe will repeat it in precisely last years form:\n\nWe prefer:\n(1) large purchases (at least $5 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\nturn-around situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we\nwont understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\n\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested. We prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuance of stock when we\nreceive as much in intrinsic business value as we give. We\ninvite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past. For the right\nbusiness - and the right people - we can provide a good home.",

    "chunk_text": "* * *\nOur annual meeting will be on May 21,1985 in Omaha, and I\nhope that you attend. Many annual meetings are a waste of time,\nboth for shareholders and for management. Sometimes that is true\nbecause management is reluctant to open up on matters of business\nsubstance. More often a nonproductive session is the fault of\nshareholder participants who are more concerned about their own\nmoment on stage than they are about the affairs of the\ncorporation. What should be a forum for business discussion\nbecomes a forum for theatrics, spleen-venting and advocacy of\nissues. (The deal is irresistible: for the price of one share you\nget to tell a captive audience your ideas as to how the world\nshould be run.) Under such circumstances, the quality of the\nmeeting often deteriorates from year to year as the antics of\nthose interested in themselves discourage attendance by those\ninterested in the business.\n\nBerkshires meetings are a different story. The number of\nshareholders attending grows a bit each year and we have yet to\nexperience a silly question or an ego-inspired commentary.\nInstead, we get a wide variety of thoughtful questions about the\nbusiness. Because the annual meeting is the time and place for\nthese, Charlie and I are happy to answer them all, no matter how\nlong it takes. (We cannot, however, respond to written or phoned\nquestions at other times of the year; one-person-at-a time\nreporting is a poor use of management time in a company with 3000\nshareholders.) The only business matters that are off limits at\nthe annual meeting are those about which candor might cost our\ncompany real money. Our activities in securities would be the\nmain example.\n\nWe always have bragged a bit on these pages about the\nquality of our shareholder-partners. Come to the annual meeting\nand you will see why. Out-of-towners should schedule a stop at\nNebraska Furniture Mart. If you make some purchases, youll save\nfar more than enough to pay for your trip, and youll enjoy the\nexperience.\n\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 25,1985 Chairman of the Board",
