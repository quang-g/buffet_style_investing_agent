Their capital positions are not\nstrong enough to withstand a big error, no matter how attractive\nan investment opportunity might appear when analyzed on the basis\nof probabilities.\n\nWith our financial strength we can own large blocks of a few\nsecurities that we have thought hard about and bought at\nattractive prices. (Billy Rose described the problem of overdiversification: If you have a harem of forty women, you never\nget to know any of them very well.) Over time our policy of\nconcentration should produce superior results, though these will\nbe tempered by our large size. When this policy produces a\nreally bad year, as it must, at least you will know that our\nmoney was committed on the same basis as yours.\n\nWe made the major part of our WPPSS investment at different\nprices and under somewhat different factual circumstances than\nexist at present. If we decide to change our position, we will\nnot inform shareholders until long after the change has been\ncompleted. (We may be buying or selling as you read this.) The\nbuying and selling of securities is a competitive business, and\neven a modest amount of added competition on either side can cost\nus a great deal of money. Our WPPSS purchases illustrate this\nprinciple. From October, 1983 through June, 1984, we attempted\nto buy almost all the bonds that we could of Projects 1,2, and\n3. Yet we purchased less than 3% of the bonds outstanding. Had\nwe faced even a few additional well-heeled investors, stimulated\nto buy because they knew we were, we could have ended up with a\nmaterially smaller amount of bonds, purchased at a materially\nhigher price. (A couple of coat-tail riders easily could have\ncost us $5 million.) For this reason, we will not comment about\nour activities in securities - neither to the press, nor\nshareholders, nor to anyone else - unless legally required to do\nso.",

    "chunk_text": "One final observation regarding our WPPSS purchases: we\ndislike the purchase of most long-term bonds under most\ncircumstances and have bought very few in recent years. Thats\nbecause bonds are as sound as a dollar - and we view the longterm outlook for dollars as dismal. We believe substantial\ninflation lies ahead, although we have no idea what the average\nrate will turn out to be. Furthermore, we think there is a\nsmall, but not insignificant, chance of runaway inflation.\n\nSuch a possibility may seem absurd, considering the rate to\nwhich inflation has dropped. But we believe that present fiscal\npolicy - featuring a huge deficit - is both extremely dangerous\nand difficult to reverse. (So far, most politicians in both\nparties have followed Charlie Browns advice: No problem is so\nbig that it cant be run away from.) Without a reversal, high\nrates of inflation may be delayed (perhaps for a long time), but\nwill not be avoided. If high rates materialize, they bring with\nthem the potential for a runaway upward spiral.\n\nWhile there is not much to choose between bonds and stocks\n(as a class) when annual inflation is in the 5%-10% range,\nrunaway inflation is a different story. In that circumstance, a\ndiversified stock portfolio would almost surely suffer an\nenormous loss in real value. But bonds already outstanding would\nsuffer far more. Thus, we think an all-bond portfolio carries a\nsmall but unacceptable wipe out risk, and we require any\npurchase of long-term bonds to clear a special hurdle. Only when\nbond purchases appear decidedly superior to other business\nopportunities will we engage in them. Those occasions are likely\nto be few and far between.",

    "chunk_text": "Many corporations that consistently show good returns both\non equity and on overall incremental capital have, indeed,\nemployed a large portion of their retained earnings on an\neconomically unattractive, even disastrous, basis. Their\nmarvelous core businesses, however, whose earnings grow year\nafter year, camouflage repeated failures in capital allocation\nelsewhere (usually involving high-priced acquisitions of\nbusinesses that have inherently mediocre economics). The\nmanagers at fault periodically report on the lessons they have\nlearned from the latest disappointment. They then usually seek\nout future lessons. (Failure seems to go to their heads.)\n\nIn such cases, shareholders would be far better off if\nearnings were retained only to expand the high-return business,\nwith the balance paid in dividends or used to repurchase stock\n(an action that increases the owners interest in the exceptional\nbusiness while sparing them participation in subpar businesses).\nManagers of high-return businesses who consistently employ much\nof the cash thrown off by those businesses in other ventures with\nlow returns should be held to account for those allocation\ndecisions, regardless of how profitable the overall enterprise\nis.",

    "chunk_text": "Lets now turn to Berkshire Hathaway and examine how these\ndividend principles apply to it. Historically, Berkshire has\nearned well over market rates on retained earnings, thereby\ncreating over one dollar of market value for every dollar\nretained. Under such circumstances, any distribution would have\nbeen contrary to the financial interest of shareholders, large or\nsmall.\n\nIn fact, significant distributions in the early years might\nhave been disastrous, as a review of our starting position will\nshow you. Charlie and I then controlled and managed three\ncompanies, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Diversified Retailing\nCompany, Inc., and Blue Chip Stamps (all now merged into our\npresent operation). Blue Chip paid only a small dividend,\nBerkshire and DRC paid nothing. If, instead, the companies had\npaid out their entire earnings, we almost certainly would have no\nearnings at all now - and perhaps no capital as well. The three\ncompanies each originally made their money from a single\nbusiness: (1) textiles at Berkshire; (2) department stores at\nDiversified; and (3) trading stamps at Blue Chip. These\ncornerstone businesses (carefully chosen, it should be noted, by\nyour Chairman and Vice Chairman) have, respectively, (1) survived\nbut earned almost nothing, (2) shriveled in size while incurring\nlarge losses, and (3) shrunk in sales volume to about 5% its size\nat the time of our entry. (Who says you cant lose em all?)\nOnly by committing available funds to much better businesses were\nwe able to overcome these origins. (Its been like overcoming a\nmisspent youth.) Clearly, diversification has served us well.",
