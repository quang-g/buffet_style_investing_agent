    "chunk_text": "946,20-year AAA tax-exempt bonds traded at slightly\nbelow a 1% yield. In effect, the buyer of those bonds at that\ntime bought a business that earned about 1% on book value\n(and that, moreover, could never earn a dime more than 1% on\nbook), and paid 100 cents on the dollar for that abominable\nbusiness.\n\nIf an investor had been business-minded enough to think in\nthose terms - and that was the precise reality of the bargain\nstruck - he would have laughed at the proposition and walked\naway. For, at the same time, businesses with excellent future\nprospects could have been bought at, or close to, book value\nwhile earning 10%, 12%, or 15% after tax on book. Probably no\nbusiness in America changed hands in 1946 at book value that the\nbuyer believed lacked the ability to earn more than 1% on book.\nBut investors with bond-buying habits eagerly made economic\ncommitments throughout the year on just that basis. Similar,\nalthough less extreme, conditions prevailed for the next two\ndecades as bond investors happily signed up for twenty or thirty\nyears on terms outrageously inadequate by business standards.\n(In what I think is by far the best book on investing ever\nwritten - The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham - the last\nsection of the last chapter begins with, Investment is most\nintelligent when it is most businesslike. This section is called\nA Final Word, and it is appropriately titled.)",

    "chunk_text": "We will emphasize again that there is unquestionably some\nrisk in the WPPSS commitment. It is also the sort of risk that\nis difficult to evaluate. Were Charlie and I to deal with 50\nsimilar evaluations over a lifetime, we would expect our judgment\nto prove reasonably satisfactory. But we do not get the chance\nto make 50 or even 5 such decisions in a single year. Even\nthough our long-term results may turn out fine, in any given year\nwe run a risk that we will look extraordinarily foolish. (Thats\nwhy all of these sentences say Charlie and I, or we.)\n\nMost managers have very little incentive to make the\nintelligent-but-with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot\ndecision. Their personal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if\nan unconventional decision works out well, they get a pat on the\nback and, if it works out poorly, they get a pink slip. (Failing\nconventionally is the route to go; as a group, lemmings may have\na rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever received bad\npress.)\n\nOur equation is different. With 47% of Berkshires stock,\nCharlie and I dont worry about being fired, and we receive our\nrewards as owners, not managers. Thus we behave with Berkshires\nmoney as we would with our own. That frequently leads us to\nunconventional behavior both in investments and general business\nmanagement.\n\nWe remain unconventional in the degree to which we\nconcentrate the investments of our insurance companies, including\nthose in WPPSS bonds. This concentration makes sense only\nbecause our insurance business is conducted from a position of\nexceptional financial strength. For almost all other insurers, a\ncomparable degree of concentration (or anything close to it)\nwould be totally inappropriate. Their capital positions are not\nstrong enough to withstand a big error, no matter how attractive\nan investment opportunity might appear when analyzed on the basis\nof probabilities.\n\nWith our financial strength we can own large blocks of a few\nsecurities that we have thought hard about and bought at\nattractive prices. (Billy Rose described the problem of overdiversification: If you have a harem of forty women, you never\nget to know any of them very well.) Over time our policy of\nconcentration should produce superior results, though these will\nbe tempered by our large size. When this policy produces a\nreally bad year, as it must, at least you will know that our\nmoney was committed on the same basis as yours.",

    "chunk_text": "We made the major part of our WPPSS investment at different\nprices and under somewhat different factual circumstances than\nexist at present. If we decide to change our position, we will\nnot inform shareholders until long after the change has been\ncompleted. (We may be buying or selling as you read this.) The\nbuying and selling of securities is a competitive business, and\neven a modest amount of added competition on either side can cost\nus a great deal of money. Our WPPSS purchases illustrate this\nprinciple. From October, 1983 through June, 1984, we attempted\nto buy almost all the bonds that we could of Projects 1,2, and\n3. Yet we purchased less than 3% of the bonds outstanding. Had\nwe faced even a few additional well-heeled investors, stimulated\nto buy because they knew we were, we could have ended up with a\nmaterially smaller amount of bonds, purchased at a materially\nhigher price. (A couple of coat-tail riders easily could have\ncost us $5 million.) For this reason, we will not comment about\nour activities in securities - neither to the press, nor\nshareholders, nor to anyone else - unless legally required to do\nso.\n\nOne final observation regarding our WPPSS purchases: we\ndislike the purchase of most long-term bonds under most\ncircumstances and have bought very few in recent years. Thats\nbecause bonds are as sound as a dollar - and we view the longterm outlook for dollars as dismal. We believe substantial\ninflation lies ahead, although we have no idea what the average\nrate will turn out to be. Furthermore, we think there is a\nsmall, but not insignificant, chance of runaway inflation.\n\nSuch a possibility may seem absurd, considering the rate to\nwhich inflation has dropped. But we believe that present fiscal\npolicy - featuring a huge deficit - is both extremely dangerous\nand difficult to reverse. (So far, most politicians in both\nparties have followed Charlie Browns advice: No problem is so\nbig that it cant be run away from.) Without a reversal, high\nrates of inflation may be delayed (perhaps for a long time), but\nwill not be avoided. If high rates materialize, they bring with\nthem the potential for a runaway upward spiral.\n\nWhile there is not much to choose between bonds and stocks\n(as a class) when annual inflation is in the 5%-10% range,\nrunaway inflation is a different story. In that circumstance, a\ndiversified stock portfolio would almost surely suffer an\nenormous loss in real value. But bonds already outstanding would\nsuffer far more. Thus, we think an all-bond portfolio carries a\nsmall but unacceptable wipe out risk, and we require any\npurchase of long-term bonds to clear a special hurdle. Only when\nbond purchases appear decidedly superior to other business\nopportunities will we engage in them. Those occasions are likely\nto be few and far between.",

A company will say something like, Our goal\nis to pay out 40% to 50% of earnings and to increase dividends at\na rate at least equal to the rise in the CPI. And thats it -\nno analysis will be supplied as to why that particular policy is\nbest for the owners of the business. Yet, allocation of capital\nis crucial to business and investment management. Because it is,\nwe believe managers and owners should think hard about the\ncircumstances under which earnings should be retained and under\nwhich they should be distributed.\n\nThe first point to understand is that all earnings are not\ncreated equal. In many businesses particularly those that have\nhigh asset/profit ratios - inflation causes some or all of the\nreported earnings to become ersatz. The ersatz portion - lets\ncall these earnings restricted - cannot, if the business is to\nretain its economic position, be distributed as dividends. Were\nthese earnings to be paid out, the business would lose ground in\none or more of the following areas: its ability to maintain its\nunit volume of sales, its long-term competitive position, its\nfinancial strength. No matter how conservative its payout ratio,\na company that consistently distributes restricted earnings is\ndestined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise infused.",

At the time, a punitive\nregulatory policy was a major factor causing the companys stock\nto sell as low as one-fourth of book value; i. e., every time a\ndollar of earnings was retained for reinvestment in the business,\nthat dollar was transformed into only 25 cents of market value.\nBut, despite this gold-into-lead process, most earnings were\nreinvested in the business rather than paid to owners.\nMeanwhile, at construction and maintenance sites throughout New\nYork, signs proudly proclaimed the corporate slogan, Dig We\nMust.)\n\nRestricted earnings need not concern us further in this\ndividend discussion.

    "chunk_text": "This principle is not universally accepted. For a number of\nreasons managers like to withhold unrestricted, readily\ndistributable earnings from shareholders - to expand the\ncorporate empire over which the managers rule, to operate from a\nposition of exceptional financial comfort, etc. But we believe\nthere is only one valid reason for retention. Unrestricted\nearnings should be retained only when there is a reasonable\nprospect - backed preferably by historical evidence or, when\nappropriate, by a thoughtful analysis of the future - that\nfor\nevery dollar retained by the corporation, at least one dollar of\nmarket value will be created for owners.\nThis will happen only\nif the capital retained produces incremental earnings equal to,\nor above, those generally available to investors.\n\nTo illustrate, lets assume that an investor owns a riskfree 10% perpetual bond with one very unusual feature. Each year\nthe investor can elect either to take his 10% coupon in cash, or\nto reinvest the coupon in more 10% bonds with identical terms;\ni. e., a perpetual life and coupons offering the same cash-orreinvest option. If, in any given year, the prevailing interest\nrate on long-term, risk-free bonds is 5%, it would be foolish for\nthe investor to take his coupon in cash since the 10% bonds he\ncould instead choose would be worth considerably more than 100\ncents on the dollar. Under these circumstances, the investor\nwanting to get his hands on cash should take his coupon in\nadditional bonds and then immediately sell them. By doing that,\nhe would realize more cash than if he had taken his coupon\ndirectly in cash. Assuming all bonds were held by rational\ninvestors, no one would opt for cash in an era of 5% interest\nrates, not even those bondholders needing cash for living\npurposes.\n\nIf, however, interest rates were 15%, no rational investor\nwould want his money invested for him at 10%. Instead, the\ninvestor would choose to take his coupon in cash, even if his\npersonal cash needs were nil. The opposite course - reinvestment\nof the coupon - would give an investor additional bonds with\nmarket value far less than the cash he could have elected. If he\nshould want 10% bonds, he can simply take the cash received\nand buy them in the market, where they will be available at a\nlarge discount.",
