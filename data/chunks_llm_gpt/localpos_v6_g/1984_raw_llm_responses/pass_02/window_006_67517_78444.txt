    "chunk_text": "erized by extraordinary economics can use small\namounts of incremental capital in that business at very high\nrates of return (as was discussed in last years section on\nGoodwill). But, unless they are experiencing tremendous unit\ngrowth, outstanding businesses by definition generate large\namounts of excess cash. If a company sinks most of this money in\nother businesses that earn low returns, the companys overall\nreturn on retained capital may nevertheless appear excellent\nbecause of the extraordinary returns being earned by the portion\nof earnings incrementally invested in the core business. The\nsituation is analogous to a Pro-Am golf event: even if all of the\namateurs are hopeless duffers, the teams best-ball score will be\nrespectable because of the dominating skills of the professional.\n\nMany corporations that consistently show good returns both\non equity and on overall incremental capital have, indeed,\nemployed a large portion of their retained earnings on an\neconomically unattractive, even disastrous, basis. Their\nmarvelous core businesses, however, whose earnings grow year\nafter year, camouflage repeated failures in capital allocation\nelsewhere (usually involving high-priced acquisitions of\nbusinesses that have inherently mediocre economics). The\nmanagers at fault periodically report on the lessons they have\nlearned from the latest disappointment. They then usually seek\nout future lessons. (Failure seems to go to their heads.)\n\nIn such cases, shareholders would be far better off if\nearnings were retained only to expand the high-return business,\nwith the balance paid in dividends or used to repurchase stock\n(an action that increases the owners interest in the exceptional\nbusiness while sparing them participation in subpar businesses).\nManagers of high-return businesses who consistently employ much\nof the cash thrown off by those businesses in other ventures with\nlow returns should be held to account for those allocation\ndecisions, regardless of how profitable the overall enterprise\nis.\n\nNothing in this discussion is intended to argue for\ndividends that bounce around from quarter to quarter with each\nwiggle in earnings or in investment opportunities. Shareholders\nof public corporations understandably prefer that dividends be\nconsistent and predictable. Payments, therefore, should reflect\nlong-term expectations for both earnings and returns on\nincremental capital. Since the long-term corporate outlook\nchanges only infrequently, dividend patterns should change no\nmore often. But over time distributable earnings that have been\nwithheld by managers should earn their keep. If earnings have\nbeen unwisely retained, it is likely that managers, too, have\nbeen unwisely retained.",

    "chunk_text": "Lets now turn to Berkshire Hathaway and examine how these\ndividend principles apply to it. Historically, Berkshire has\nearned well over market rates on retained earnings, thereby\ncreating over one dollar of market value for every dollar\nretained. Under such circumstances, any distribution would have\nbeen contrary to the financial interest of shareholders, large or\nsmall.\n\nIn fact, significant distributions in the early years might\nhave been disastrous, as a review of our starting position will\nshow you. Charlie and I then controlled and managed three\ncompanies, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Diversified Retailing\nCompany, Inc., and Blue Chip Stamps (all now merged into our\npresent operation). Blue Chip paid only a small dividend,\nBerkshire and DRC paid nothing. If, instead, the companies had\npaid out their entire earnings, we almost certainly would have no\nearnings at all now - and perhaps no capital as well. The three\ncompanies each originally made their money from a single\nbusiness: (1) textiles at Berkshire; (2) department stores at\nDiversified; and (3) trading stamps at Blue Chip. These\ncornerstone businesses (carefully chosen, it should be noted, by\nyour Chairman and Vice Chairman) have, respectively, (1) survived\nbut earned almost nothing, (2) shriveled in size while incurring\nlarge losses, and (3) shrunk in sales volume to about 5% its size\nat the time of our entry. (Who says you cant lose em all?)\nOnly by committing available funds to much better businesses were\nwe able to overcome these origins. (Its been like overcoming a\nmisspent youth.) Clearly, diversification has served us well.\n\nWe expect to continue to diversify while also supporting the\ngrowth of current operations though, as weve pointed out, our\nreturns from these efforts will surely be below our historical\nreturns. But as long as prospective returns are above the rate\nrequired to produce a dollar of market value per dollar retained,\nwe will continue to retain all earnings. Should our estimate of\nfuture returns fall below that point, we will distribute all\nunrestricted earnings that we believe can not be effectively\nused. In making that judgment, we will look at both our\nhistorical record and our prospects. Because our year-to-year\nresults are inherently volatile, we believe a five-year rolling\naverage to be appropriate for judging the historical record.\n\nOur present plan is to use our retained earnings to further\nbuild the capital of our insurance companies. Most of our\ncompetitors are in weakened financial condition and reluctant to\nexpand substantially. Yet large premium-volume gains for the\nindustry are imminent, amounting probably to well over $15\nbillion in 1985 versus less than $5 billion in 1983. These\ncircumstances could produce major amounts of profitable business\nfor us. Of course, this result is no sure thing, but prospects\nfor it are far better than they have been for many years.",

Sometimes that is true\nbecause management is reluctant to open up on matters of business\nsubstance. More often a nonproductive session is the fault of\nshareholder participants who are more concerned about their own\nmoment on stage than they are about the affairs of the\ncorporation. What should be a forum for business discussion\nbecomes a forum for theatrics, spleen-venting and advocacy of\nissues. (The deal is irresistible: for the price of one share you\nget to tell a captive audience your ideas as to how the world\nshould be run.) Under such circumstances, the quality of the\nmeeting often deteriorates from year to year as the antics of\nthose interested in themselves discourage attendance by those\ninterested in the business.\n\nBerkshires meetings are a different story. The number of\nshareholders attending grows a bit each year and we have yet to\nexperience a silly question or an ego-inspired commentary.\nInstead, we get a wide variety of thoughtful questions about the\nbusiness. Because the annual meeting is the time and place for\nthese, Charlie and I are happy to answer them all, no matter how\nlong it takes. (We cannot, however, respond to written or phoned\nquestions at other times of the year; one-person-at-a time\nreporting is a poor use of management time in a company with 3000\nshareholders.) The only business matters that are off limits at\nthe annual meeting are those about which candor might cost our\ncompany real money. Our activities in securities would be the\nmain example.\n\nWe always have bragged a bit on these pages about the\nquality of our shareholder-partners.
