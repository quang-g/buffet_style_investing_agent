    "chunk_text": "For a number of years, we have told you that an annual\nincrease by the industry of about 10% per year in premiums\nwritten is necessary for the combined ratio to remain roughly\nunchanged. We assumed in making that assertion that expenses as\na percentage of premium volume would stay relatively stable and\nthat losses would grow at about 10% annually because of the\ncombined influence of unit volume increases, inflation, and\njudicial rulings that expand what is covered by the insurance\npolicy.\n\nOur opinion is proving dismayingly accurate: a premium\nincrease of 10% per year since 1979 would have produced an\naggregate increase through 1984 of 61% and a combined ratio in\n1984 almost identical to the 100.6 of 1979. Instead, the\nindustry had only a 30% increase in premiums and a 1984 combined\nratio of 117.7. Today, we continue to believe that the key index\nto the trend of underwriting profitability is the year-to-year\npercentage change in industry premium volume.\n\nIt now appears that premium volume in 1985 will grow well\nover 10%. Therefore, assuming that catastrophes are at a\nnormal level, we would expect the combined ratio to begin\neasing downward toward the end of the year. However, under our\nindustrywide loss assumptions (i. e., increases of 10% annually),\nfive years of 15%-per-year increases in premiums would be\nrequired to get the combined ratio back to 100. This would mean\na doubling of industry volume by 1989, an outcome that seems\nhighly unlikely to us. Instead, we expect several years of\npremium gains somewhat above the 10% level, followed by highlycompetitive pricing that generally will produce combined ratios\nin the 108-113 range.",

    "chunk_text": "Our financial strength is a particular asset in the business\nof structured settlements and loss reserve assumptions that we\nreported on last year. The claimant in a structured settlement\nand the insurance company that has reinsured loss reserves need\nto be completely confident that payments will be forthcoming for\ndecades to come. Very few companies in the property/casualty\nfield can meet this test of unquestioned long-term strength. (In\nfact, only a handful of companies exists with which we will\nreinsure our own liabilities.)\n\nWe have grown in these new lines of business: funds that we\nhold to offset assumed liabilities grew from $16.2 million to\n$30.6 million during the year. We expect growth to continue and\nperhaps to greatly accelerate. To support this projected growth\nwe have added substantially to the capital of Columbia Insurance\nCompany, our reinsurance unit specializing in structured\nsettlements and loss reserve assumptions. While these businesses\nare very competitive, returns should be satisfactory.\n\nAt GEICO the news, as usual, is mostly good. That company\nachieved excellent unit growth in its primary insurance business\nduring 1984, and the performance of its investment portfolio\ncontinued to be extraordinary. Though underwriting results\ndeteriorated late in the year, they still remain far better than\nthose of the industry. Our ownership in GEICO at yearend\namounted to 36% and thus our interest in their direct\nproperty/casualty volume of $885 million amounted to $320\nmillion, or well over double our own premium volume.\n\nI have reported to you in the past few years that the\nperformance of GEICOs stock has considerably exceeded that\ncompanys business performance, brilliant as the latter has been.\nIn those years, the carrying value of our GEICO investment on our\nbalance sheet grew at a rate greater than the growth in GEICOs\nintrinsic business value. I warned you that over performance by\nthe stock relative to the performance of the business obviously\ncould not occur every year, and that in some years the stock must\nunder perform the business. In 1984 that occurred and the\ncarrying value of our interest in GEICO changed hardly at all,\nwhile the intrinsic business value of that interest increased\nsubstantially. Since 27% of Berkshires net worth at the\nbeginning of 1984 was represented by GEICO, its static market\nvalue had a significant impact upon our rate of gain for the\nyear. We are not at all unhappy with such a result: we would far\nrather have the business value of GEICO increase by X during the\nyear, while market value decreases, than have the intrinsic value\nincrease by only 1/2 X with market value soaring. In GEICOs\ncase, as in all of our investments, we look to business\nperformance, not market performance. If we are correct in\nexpectations regarding the business, the market eventually will\nfollow along.\n\nYou, as shareholders of Berkshire, have benefited in\nenormous measure from the talents of GEICOs Jack Byrne, Bill\nSnyder, and Lou Simpson. In its core business - low-cost auto\nand homeowners insurance - GEICO has a major, sustainable\ncompetitive advantage. That is a rare asset in business\ngenerally, and its almost non-existent in the field of financial\nservices. (GEICO, itself, illustrates this point: despite the\ncompanys excellent management, superior profitability has eluded\nGEICO in all endeavors other than its core business.) In a large\nindustry, a competitive advantage such as GEICOs provides the\npotential for unusual economic rewards, and Jack and Bill\ncontinue to exhibit great skill in realizing that potential.\n\nMost of the funds generated by GEICOs core insurance\noperation are made available to Lou for investment. Lou has the\nrare combination of temperamental and intellectual\ncharacteristics that produce outstanding long-term investment\nperformance. Operating with below-average risk, he has generated\nreturns that have been by far the best in the insurance industry.\nI applaud and appreciate the efforts and talents of these three\noutstanding managers.",

    "chunk_text": "Errors in Loss Reserving\n\nAny shareholder in a company with important interests in the\nproperty/casualty insurance business should have some\nunderstanding of the weaknesses inherent in the reporting of\ncurrent earnings in that industry. Phil Graham, when publisher\nof the Washington Post, described the daily newspaper as a first\nrough draft of history. Unfortunately, the financial statements\nof a property/casualty insurer provide, at best, only a first\nrough draft of earnings and financial condition.\n\nThe determination of costs is the main problem. Most of an\ninsurers costs result from losses on claims, and many of the\nlosses that should be charged against the current years revenue\nare exceptionally difficult to estimate. Sometimes the extent of\nthese losses, or even their existence, is not known for decades.\n\nThe loss expense charged in a property/casualty companys\ncurrent income statement represents: (1) losses that occurred and\nwere paid during the year; (2) estimates for losses that occurred\nand were reported to the insurer during the year, but which have\nyet to be settled; (3) estimates of ultimate dollar costs for\nlosses that occurred during the year but of which the insurer is\nunaware (termed IBNR: incurred but not reported); and (4) the\nnet effect of revisions this year of similar estimates for (2)\nand (3) made in past years.\n\nSuch revisions may be long delayed, but eventually any\nestimate of losses that causes the income for year X to be\nmisstated must be corrected, whether it is in year X + 1, or\nX + 10. This, perforce, means that earnings in the year of\ncorrection also are misstated. For example, assume a claimant\nwas injured by one of our insureds in 1979 and we thought a\nsettlement was likely to be made for $10,000. That year we would\nhave charged $10,000 to our earnings statement for the estimated\ncost of the loss and, correspondingly, set up a liability reserve\non the balance sheet for that amount. If we settled the claim in\n1984 for $100,000, we would charge earnings with a loss cost of\n$90,000 in 1984, although that cost was truly an expense of 1979.\nAnd if that piece of business was our only activity in 1979, we\nwould have badly misled ourselves as to costs, and you as to\nearnings.\n\nThe necessarily-extensive use of estimates in assembling the\nfigures that appear in such deceptively precise form in the\nincome statement of property/casualty companies means that some\nerror must seep in, no matter how proper the intentions of\nmanagement. In an attempt to minimize error, most insurers use\nvarious statistical techniques to adjust the thousands of\nindividual loss evaluations (called case reserves) that comprise\nthe raw data for estimation of aggregate liabilities. The extra\nreserves created by these adjustments are variously labeled\nbulk, development, or supplemental reserves. The goal of\nthe adjustments should be a loss-reserve total that has a 50-50\nchance of being proved either slightly too high or slightly too\nlow when all losses that occurred prior to the date of the\nfinancial statement are ultimately paid.\n\nAt Berkshire, we have added what we thought were appropriate\nsupplemental reserves but in recent years they have not been\nadequate. It is important that you understand the magnitude of\nthe errors that have been involved in our reserving. You can\nthus see for yourselves just how imprecise the process is, and\nalso judge whether we may have some systemic bias that should\nmake you wary of our current and future figures.\n\nThe following table shows the results from insurance\nunderwriting as we have reported them to you in recent years, and\nalso gives you calculations a year later on an if-we-knew-thenwhat-we think-we-know-now basis. I say what we think we know\nnow because the adjusted figures still include a great many\nestimates for losses that occurred in the earlier years.\nHowever, many claims from the earlier years have been settled so\nthat our one-year-later estimate contains less guess work than\nour earlier estimate:\n\nUnderwriting Results Corrected Figures\nas Reported After One Years\nYear to You Experience\n---- -------------------- -----------------\n\n1980 $ 6,738,000 $ 14,887,000\n1981 1,478,000 (1,118,000)\n1982 (21,462,000) (25,066,000)\n1983 (33,192,000) (50,974,000)\n1984 (45,413,000) ?\n\nOur structured settlement and loss-reserve assumption\nbusinesses are not included in this table. Important\nadditional information on loss reserve experience appears\non pages 43-45.\n\nTo help you understand this table, here is an explanation of\nthe most recent figures: 1984 s reported pre-tax underwriting\nloss of $45.4 million consists of $27.6 million we estimate that\nwe lost on 1984 s business, plus the increased loss of $17.8\nmillion reflected in the corrected figure for 1983.\n\nAs you can see from reviewing the table, my errors in\nreporting to you have been substantial and recently have always\npresented a better underwriting picture than was truly the case.\nThis is a source of particular chagrin to me because: (1) I like\nfor you to be able to count on what I say; (2) our insurance\nmanagers and I undoubtedly acted with less urgency than we would\nhave had we understood the full extent of our losses; and (3) we\npaid income taxes calculated on overstated earnings and thereby\ngave the government money that we didnt need to. (These\noverpayments eventually correct themselves, but the delay is long\nand we dont receive interest on the amounts we overpaid.)",
