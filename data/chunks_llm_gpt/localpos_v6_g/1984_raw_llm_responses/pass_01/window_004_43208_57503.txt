    "chunk_text": "we lost on 1984 s business, plus the increased loss of $17.8\nmillion reflected in the corrected figure for 1983.\n\nAs you can see from reviewing the table, my errors in\nreporting to you have been substantial and recently have always\npresented a better underwriting picture than was truly the case.\nThis is a source of particular chagrin to me because: (1) I like\nfor you to be able to count on what I say; (2) our insurance\nmanagers and I undoubtedly acted with less urgency than we would\nhave had we understood the full extent of our losses; and (3) we\npaid income taxes calculated on overstated earnings and thereby\ngave the government money that we didnt need to. (These\noverpayments eventually correct themselves, but the delay is long\nand we dont receive interest on the amounts we overpaid.)\n\nBecause our business is weighted toward casualty and\nreinsurance lines, we have more problems in estimating loss costs\nthan companies that specialize in property insurance. (When a\nbuilding that you have insured burns down, you get a much faster\nfix on your costs than you do when an employer you have insured\nfinds out that one of his retirees has contracted a disease\nattributable to work he did decades earlier.) But I still find\nour errors embarrassing. In our direct business, we have far\nunderestimated the mushrooming tendency of juries and courts to\nmake the deep pocket pay, regardless of the factual situation\nand the past precedents for establishment of liability. We also\nhave underestimated the contagious effect that publicity\nregarding giant awards has on juries. In the reinsurance area,\nwhere we have had our worst experience in under reserving, our\ncustomer insurance companies have made the same mistakes. Since\nwe set reserves based on information they supply us, their\nmistakes have become our mistakes.",

    "chunk_text": "I heard a story recently that is applicable to our insurance\naccounting problems: a man was traveling abroad when he received\na call from his sister informing him that their father had died\nunexpectedly. It was physically impossible for the brother to\nget back home for the funeral, but he told his sister to take\ncare of the funeral arrangements and to send the bill to him.\nAfter returning home he received a bill for several thousand\ndollars, which he promptly paid. The following month another\nbill came along for $15, and he paid that too. Another month\nfollowed, with a similar bill. When, in the next month, a third\nbill for $15 was presented, he called his sister to ask what was\ngoing on. Oh, she said. I forgot to tell you. We buried Dad\nin a rented suit.\n\nIf youve been in the insurance business in recent years -\nparticularly the reinsurance business - this story hurts. We\nhave tried to include all of our rented suit liabilities in our\ncurrent financial statement, but our record of past error should\nmake us humble, and you suspicious. I will continue to report to\nyou the errors, plus or minus, that surface each year.\n\nNot all reserving errors in the industry have been of the\ninnocent-but-dumb variety. With underwriting results as bad as\nthey have been in recent years - and with managements having as\nmuch discretion as they do in the presentation of financial\nstatements - some unattractive aspects of human nature have\nmanifested themselves. Companies that would be out of business if they realistically appraised their loss costs have, in some\ncases, simply preferred to take an extraordinarily optimistic\nview about these yet-to-be-paid sums. Others have engaged in\nvarious transactions to hide true current loss costs.\n\nBoth of these approaches can work for a considerable time:\nexternal auditors cannot effectively police the financial\nstatements of property/casualty insurers. If liabilities of an\ninsurer, correctly stated, would exceed assets, it falls to the\ninsurer to volunteer this morbid information. In other words,\nthe corpse is supposed to file the death certificate. Under this\nhonor system of mortality, the corpse sometimes gives itself\nthe benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn most businesses, of course, insolvent companies run out\nof cash. Insurance is different: you can be broke but flush.\nSince cash comes in at the inception of an insurance policy and\nlosses are paid much later, insolvent insurers dont run out of\ncash until long after they have run out of net worth. In fact,\nthese walking dead often redouble their efforts to write\nbusiness, accepting almost any price or risk, simply to keep the\ncash flowing in. With an attitude like that of an embezzler who\nhas gambled away his purloined funds, these companies hope that\nsomehow they can get lucky on the next batch of business and\nthereby cover up earlier shortfalls. Even if they dont get\nlucky, the penalty to managers is usually no greater for a $100\nmillion shortfall than one of $10 million; in the meantime, while\nthe losses mount, the managers keep their jobs and perquisites.\n\nThe loss-reserving errors of other property/casualty\ncompanies are of more than academic interest to Berkshire. Not\nonly does Berkshire suffer from sell-at-any-price competition by\nthe walking dead, but we also suffer when their insolvency is\nfinally acknowledged. Through various state guarantee funds that\nlevy assessments, Berkshire ends up paying a portion of the\ninsolvent insurers asset deficiencies, swollen as they usually\nare by the delayed detection that results from wrong reporting.\nThere is even some potential for cascading trouble. The\ninsolvency of a few large insurers and the assessments by state\nguarantee funds that would follow could imperil weak-butpreviously-solvent insurers. Such dangers can be mitigated if\nstate regulators become better at prompt identification and\ntermination of insolvent insurers, but progress on that front has\nbeen slow.",

This business-valuation approach is not\nwidespread among professional money managers and is scorned by\nmany academics. Nevertheless, it has served its followers well\n(to which the academics seem to say, Well, it may be all right\nin practice, but it will never work in theory.) Simply put, we\nfeel that if we can buy small pieces of businesses with\nsatisfactory underlying economics at a fraction of the per-share\nvalue of the entire business, something good is likely to happen\nto us - particularly if we own a group of such securities.\n\nWe extend this business-valuation approach even to bond\npurchases such as WPPSS. We compare the $139 million cost of our\nyearend investment in WPPSS to a similar $139 million investment\nin an operating business. In the case of WPPSS, the business\ncontractually earns $22.7 million after tax (via the interest\npaid on the bonds), and those earnings are available to us\ncurrently in cash. We are unable to buy operating businesses\nwith economics close to these. Only a relatively few businesses\nearn the 16.3% after tax on unleveraged capital that our WPPSS\ninvestment does and those businesses, when available for\npurchase, sell at large premiums to that capital. In the average\nnegotiated business transaction, unleveraged corporate earnings\nof $22.7 million after-tax (equivalent to about $45 million pretax) might command a price of $250 - $300 million (or sometimes\nfar more). For a business we understand well and strongly like,\nwe will gladly pay that much. But it is double the price we paid\nto realize the same earnings from WPPSS bonds.",

    "chunk_text": "(Lets push our bond-as-a-business example one notch\nfurther: if you elect to retain the annual earnings of a 12%\nbond by using the proceeds from coupons to buy more bonds,\nearnings of that bond business will grow at a rate comparable\nto that of most operating businesses that similarly reinvest all\nearnings. In the first instance, a 30-year, zero-coupon, 12%\nbond purchased today for $10 million will be worth $300 million\nin 2015. In the second, a $10 million business that regularly\nearns 12% on equity and retains all earnings to grow, will also\nend up with $300 million of capital in 2015. Both the business\nand the bond will earn over $32 million in the final year.)\n\nOur approach to bond investment - treating it as an unusual\nsort of business with special advantages and disadvantages -\nmay strike you as a bit quirky. However, we believe that many\nstaggering errors by investors could have been avoided if they\nhad viewed bond investment with a businessmans perspective. For\nexample, in 1946,20-year AAA tax-exempt bonds traded at slightly\nbelow a 1% yield. In effect, the buyer of those bonds at that\ntime bought a business that earned about 1% on book value\n(and that, moreover, could never earn a dime more than 1% on\nbook), and paid 100 cents on the dollar for that abominable\nbusiness.\n\nIf an investor had been business-minded enough to think in\nthose terms - and that was the precise reality of the bargain\nstruck - he would have laughed at the proposition and walked\naway. For, at the same time, businesses with excellent future\nprospects could have been bought at, or close to, book value\nwhile earning 10%, 12%, or 15% after tax on book. Probably no\nbusiness in America changed hands in 1946 at book value that the\nbuyer believed lacked the ability to earn more than 1% on book.\nBut investors with bond-buying habits eagerly made economic\ncommitments throughout the year on just that basis. Similar,\nalthough less extreme, conditions prevailed for the next two\ndecades as bond investors happily signed up for twenty or thirty\nyears on terms outrageously inadequate by business standards.\n(In what I think is by far the best book on investing ever\nwritten - The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham - the last\nsection of the last chapter begins with, Investment is most\nintelligent when it is most businesslike. This section is called\nA Final Word, and it is appropriately titled.)",

Were Charlie and I to deal with 50\nsimilar evaluations over a lifetime, we would expect our judgment\nto prove reasonably satisfactory. But we do not get the chance\nto make 50 or even 5 such decisions in a single year. Even\nthough our long-term results may turn out fine, in any given year\nwe run a risk that we will look extraordinarily foolish. (Thats\nwhy all of these sentences say Charlie and I, or we.)\n\nMost managers have very little incentive to make the\nintelligent-but-with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot\ndecision. Their personal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if\nan unconventional decision works out well, they get a pat on the\nback and, if it works out poorly, they get a pink slip. (Failing\nconventionally is the route to go; as a group, lemmings may have\na rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever received bad\npress.)\n\nOur equation is different. With 47% of Berkshires stock,\nCharlie and I dont worry about being fired, and we receive our\nrewards as owners, not managers. Thus we behave with Berkshires\nmoney as we would with our own. That frequently leads us to\nunconventional behavior both in investments and general business\nmanagement.\n\nWe remain unconventional in the degree to which we\nconcentrate the investments of our insurance companies, including\nthose in WPPSS bonds. This concentration makes sense only\nbecause our insurance business is conducted from a position of\nexceptional financial strength. For almost all other insurers, a\ncomparable degree of concentration (or anything close to it)\nwould be totally inappropriate. Their capital positions are not\nstrong enough to withstand a big error, no matter how attractive\nan investment opportunity might appear when analyzed on the basis\nof probabilities.\n\nWith our financial strength we can own large blocks of a few\nsecurities that we have thought hard about and bought at\nattractive prices. (Billy Rose described the problem of overdiversification: If you have a harem of forty women, you never\nget to know any of them very well.) Over time our policy of\nconcentration should produce superior results, though these will\nbe tempered by our large size.
