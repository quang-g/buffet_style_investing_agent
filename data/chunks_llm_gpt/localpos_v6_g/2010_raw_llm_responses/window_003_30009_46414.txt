    "chunk_text": "GEICO\nNow let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can far\nexceed its book value. Relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories.\nSixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a\n20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a\nonce-a-week class at the school.\n\nOne day at the library, I checked out Ben’s entry in Who’s Who in America and found he was\nchairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had\nnever heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, after\nreading the page on GEICO, I decided to visit the company. The following Saturday, I boarded an early train for\nWashington.\nAlas, when I arrived at the company’s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I could\ntalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson.\nThat was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, “Davy” gave me an education about both\ninsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated from\nColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which got\nme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon after\nmeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.)\nSubsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it got\ninto trouble in the mid-1970 s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened – with the stock falling by\nmore than 95% – Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the years\nincreased to 50% because of GEICO’s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire’s cost for this half of the business\nwas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.)\nWe then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95,\nto make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside with\nBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, “Next time, Warren, please make an appointment.”)",

    "chunk_text": "A lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal – saving Americans substantial\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance – remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 or\nwww. GEICO. com.) In other words, get the policyholder’s business by deserving his business. Focusing on this\nobjective, the company has grown to be America’s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%.\nWhen Tony Nicely, GEICO’s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had\nbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistent\ngrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low.\nLet me quantify Tony’s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn’t already\nown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangible\nnet worth of $1.9 billion.\nThe excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimated\nGEICO’s “goodwill” to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders\nwho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in\npremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were\nannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary\ninsurer: Because of the company’s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.\nToday, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our\nbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO\nincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value\ndecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick we\napplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO’s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And this\nvalue is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO – off to a strong start in 2011 – is the\ngift that keeps giving.",

    "chunk_text": "Insurance\nProperty-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to\nothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims\ncome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at the\nfollowing table:\nFloat\nYearend (in $ millions)\n1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 39\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 237\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,632\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,871\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65,832\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free\nmoney – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a\nsignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State\nFarm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss in\nseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.\nAt Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite\nprofitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better than\ncost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holding\nits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.",

Some of the businesses\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poor\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came about\nbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics of\nthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes\nmy eyesight has been poor.\nMost of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let’s look\nfirst at the record-breakers.\n• TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008)\nand pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, with\nNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes are\npedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI’s exceptional performance is created\nby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.",
