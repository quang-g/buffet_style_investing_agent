Our share of the\nundistributed earnings of these investees, however, was more than $2 billion last year. These retained earnings\nare important. In our experience – and, for that matter, in the experience of investors over the past century –\nundistributed earnings have been either matched or exceeded by market gains, albeit in a highly irregular manner.\n(Indeed, sometimes the correlation goes in reverse. As one investor said in 2009: “This is worse than divorce.\nI’ve lost half my net worth – and I still have my wife.”) In the future, we expect our market gains to eventually at\nleast equal the earnings our investees retain.",

    "chunk_text": "In our earlier estimate of Berkshire’s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to\nfuture investment income (but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just\ndescribed).\nThe first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income\ninvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these – our Swiss Re\nnote – was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others – our Goldman Sachs and General Electric\npreferred stocks – are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in October\nand has stated its intention to do so. Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but has\nbeen held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light\nbefore long.\nAll three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so – in aggregate about $1.4 billion –\nbut all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly\nreduced. That’s the bad news.\nThere are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least\n$500 million – and perhaps much more – to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yields\nis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of\n“normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an\nopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To update\nAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\nIn addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen\ndividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though\nconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength\nand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don’t fault the Fed: For\nvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just\nthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In\n2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I\nwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share of\nCoke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\nOverall, I believe our “normal” investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.",
