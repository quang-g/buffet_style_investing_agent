    "chunk_text": "stand that we get paid up-front when\nwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That’s important.\nOur first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minor\nexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.\nIn aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an “underwriting\nprofit,” meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we would\nbenefit from the use of float.\n\nSubsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A\nnumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,\nhowever, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, it\nappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have had\nthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged the\nright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago.",

    "chunk_text": "Our other large derivatives position – whose contracts go by the name of “equity puts” – involves\ninsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in the\nU. S., U. K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&P 500 in the U. S.\nand the FTSE 100 in the U. K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of these\ncontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination date\ncounts: No payments can be required before then.\nAs a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originally\nreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.\nConsequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that\n$647 million for about three years.\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.\nThe future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31,2010 –\nand foreign exchange rates are unchanged – we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to\n2026. You can call this amount “settlement value.”\nOn our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will record\na $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion and\nthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability will\nfall significantly between now and settlement date. But that, of course, is far from a sure thing.\nWhat is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining “float” of $4.2 billion for an average of about\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance float\nfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase\nof BNSF.\nAs I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\ncollateral – a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feeling\ncomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.\nForegoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it.",

    "chunk_text": "Earlier in this letter, I pointed out some numbers that Charlie and I find useful in valuing Berkshire and\nmeasuring its progress.\nLet’s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net\nincome. Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaningless at Berkshire.\nRegardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could – quite legally – cause net income in any\ngiven period to be almost any number we would like.\n\nWe have that flexibility because realized gains or losses on investments go into the net income figure,\nwhereas unrealized gains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a\n$10 billion increase in unrealized gains in a given year and concurrently had $1 billion of realized losses. Our net\nincome – which would count only the loss – would be reported as less than our operating income. If we had\nmeanwhile realized gains in the previous year, headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down X% when\nin reality our business might be much improved.\nIf we really thought net income important, we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply because\nwe have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I have\nnever sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. We both\nhave a deep disgust for “game playing” with numbers, a practice that was rampant throughout corporate America\nin the 1990 s and still persists, though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to.\nOperating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonable guide as to how our\nbusinesses are doing. Ignore our net income figure, however. Regulations require that we report it to you. But if\nyou find reporters focusing on it, that will speak more to their performance than ours.\nBoth realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value.\nPay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on the\nright track.",

    "chunk_text": "* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAs a p. s., I can’t resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. Had our equity puts\nhad a termination date of June 30,2010, we would have been required to pay $6.4 billion to our counterparties at\nthat date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figure\ndown to $5.8 billion on September 30 th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contracts\nrequired us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change\nthat, after the effect of tax accruals, reduced our net income for the quarter by $455 million.\nBoth Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to\nlong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our\nmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that\nthe Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.\nWe continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is\nthe accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would be\naccused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an\ninsurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black Scholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of\nboth their values and ours were the two far apart.\nPart of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number.\nCharlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that\ncalculated by Black-Scholes, but we can’t come up with an exact figure – anymore than we can come up with a\nprecise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t\nbother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They\nmade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly.\nWitness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970 s and\n1980 s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it “anomalies.” (I always love explanations of that kind:\nThe Flat Earth Society probably views a ship’s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential,\nanomaly.)\n\nAcademics’ current practice of teaching Black-Scholes as revealed truth needs re-examination. For that\nmatter, so does the academic’s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as\nan investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to\nvalue a business. That’s what investing is all about.",

    "chunk_text": "Life and Debt\nThe fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is\nequally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire.\nUnquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However,\nthat’s also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gains. Your spouse thinks you’re\nclever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, very\nfew people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade – and some relearned in\n2008 – any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers may be, evaporates when multiplied by a\nsingle zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smart\npeople.\nLeverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that\nthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, either\nbecause of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by\npayment. For that, only cash will do the job.\nBorrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed.\nWhen either is missing, that’s all that is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.\nIn September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously close\nto bringing our entire country to its knees.\nCharlie and I have no interest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to Berkshire’s wellbeing. (With our having a combined age of 167, starting over is not on our bucket list.) We are forever conscious\nof the fact that you, our partners, have entrusted us with what in many cases is a major portion of your savings. In\naddition, important philanthropy is dependent on our prudence. Finally, many disabled victims of accidents\ncaused by our insureds are counting on us to deliver sums payable decades from now.
