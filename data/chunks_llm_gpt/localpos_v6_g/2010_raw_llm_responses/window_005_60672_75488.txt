    "chunk_text": "In our earlier estimate of Berkshire’s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to\nfuture investment income (but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just\ndescribed).\nThe first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income\ninvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these – our Swiss Re\nnote – was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others – our Goldman Sachs and General Electric\npreferred stocks – are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in October\nand has stated its intention to do so. Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but has\nbeen held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light\nbefore long.\nAll three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so – in aggregate about $1.4 billion –\nbut all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly\nreduced. That’s the bad news.\nThere are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least\n$500 million – and perhaps much more – to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yields\nis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of\n“normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an\nopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To update\nAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\nIn addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen\ndividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though\nconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength\nand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don’t fault the Fed: For\nvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just\nthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In\n2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I\nwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share of\nCoke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\nOverall, I believe our “normal” investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.",

    "chunk_text": "Last summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 – an age Charlie and\nI regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire – his call was a surprise.\nLou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has been\ninvaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates only\nbecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?\nLou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment\ngreats. We will miss him.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFour years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on\nwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren’t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediately\navailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area.\nIt’s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, though\nimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved is\ncrucial, as is the manager’s understanding of – and sensitivity to – risk (which in no way should be measured by\nbeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with a\nhard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally,\nwe wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job.",

    "chunk_text": "When Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by\nundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have\nreceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their\nlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly started\nanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past\nlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\nAs long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire’s holdings, both bonds\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can reset\nannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like to\nrequire style boxes such as “long-short,” “macro,” “international equities.” At Berkshire our only style box is\n“smart.”)\nOver time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager’s performance compensation be dependent on his or her own\nportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big for\nindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\nWhen Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a useful\nperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted – but not to have a vote – on the\nwisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\nOne footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a number of commentators\npointed out that he was “little-known” and expressed puzzlement that we didn’t seek a “big-name.” I wonder\nhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959. Our goal\nwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops – that may not be the smartest\nmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)",
