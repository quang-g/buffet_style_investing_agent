In all other respects, the results are calculated using\nthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index\nshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.",

    "chunk_text": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nThe per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over the\nlast 46 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $95,453, a rate of\n20.2% compounded annually.*\nThe highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that’s working\nout even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire’s “normal”\nearning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share\ncount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we’ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this\ntransaction have turned out very well.\nA “normal year,” of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire\nand my partner, or I can define with anything like precision. But for the purpose of estimating our current earning\npower, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business\nclimate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, and\nseveral others that I will explain in the “Investment” section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of the\nassets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains or\nlosses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base.\nBoth of us are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmental\nadvantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means\nour railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reduced\ngreenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits.\nOver time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full\nshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better\nsituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our\nchecks will clear.\nLast year – in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy – we demonstrated our enthusiasm\nfor capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount,\n$5.4 billion – or 90% of the total – was spent in the United States. Certainly our businesses will expand abroad in\nthe future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a new\nrecord for capital spending – $8 billion – and spend all of the $2 billion increase in the United States.\nMoney will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.\nCommentators today often talk of “great uncertainty.” But think back, for example, to December 6,1941, October 18,1987 and September 10,2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always uncertain.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500 th of those shown for A.",

    "chunk_text": "Don’t let that reality spook you. Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantly\nmoaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than\nwhen I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that is certain: Human potential\nis far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential – a system that has worked wonders\nfor over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War – remains alive and\neffective.\nWe are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder. But\nlook around you and see a world beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. Now, as in 1776,1861,1932 and\n1941, America’s best days lie ahead.\nPerformance\nCharlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish\nperformance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot\nthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull’s-eye around wherever it lands.\nIn Berkshire’s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate\ngreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But,\nif we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves could\nhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund.\nThe challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me\nseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn’t possible.\nTo eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value – book value –\nwhen measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying\nvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we’ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swings\nwildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing.\nThe table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&P, a performance quite good in the earlier\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums of\ncapital we currently manage eliminate any chance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, for\nbetter-than-average results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard.\nYearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of\nthe earth’s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas or\noperating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year on\nadvertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amount\nproductively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many large\ninvestments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road.\nTo provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly\nfigures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tell\nan interesting story. On a comparative basis, our best years ended in the early 1980 s. The market’s golden period,\nhowever, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relative\nadvantage narrowed.\nAfter 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory\nperformance relative to the S&P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absolute\nresults.\nLooking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&P – though that result is, of\ncourse, far from a sure thing. If we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results in\nbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets.",
