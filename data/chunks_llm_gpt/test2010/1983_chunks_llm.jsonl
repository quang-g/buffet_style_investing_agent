But we will be\ndisappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average\nlarge American corporation.\n\no\nOur preference would be to reach this goal by directly\nowning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and\nconsistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second\nchoice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily\nthrough purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance\nsubsidiaries.
