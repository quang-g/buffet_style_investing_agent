Of\nthese earnings, $1.43 per share resulted from substantial\nrealized capital gains by Blue Chip Stamps which, to the extent\nof our proportional interest in that company, are included in our\noperating earnings figure. Capital gains or losses realized\ndirectly by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. or its insurance subsidiaries\nare not included in our calculation of operating earnings. While\ntoo much attention should not be paid to the figure for any\nsingle year, over the longer term the record regarding aggregate\ncapital gains or losses obviously is of significance.\n\nTextile operations came in well below forecast, while the\nresults of the Illinois National Bank as well as the operating\nearnings attributable to our equity interest in Blue Chip Stamps\nwere about as anticipated. However, insurance operations, led\nagain by the truly outstanding results of Phil Liesches\nmanagerial group at National Indemnity Company, were even better\nthan our optimistic expectations.\n\nMost companies define record earnings as a new high in\nearnings per share. Since businesses customarily add from year\nto year to their equity base, we find nothing particularly\nnoteworthy in a management performance combining, say, a 10%\nincrease in equity capital and a 5% increase in earnings per\nshare. After all, even a totally dormant savings account will\nproduce steadily rising interest earnings each year because of\ncompounding.\n\nExcept for special cases (for example, companies with\nunusual debt-equity ratios or those with important assets carried\nat unrealistic balance sheet values), we believe a more\nappropriate measure of managerial economic performance to be\nreturn on equity capital. In 1977 our operating earnings on\nbeginning equity capital amounted to 19%, slightly better than\nlast year and above both our own long-term average and that of\nAmerican industry in aggregate. But, while our operating\nearnings per share were up 37% from the year before, our\nbeginning capital was up 24%, making the gain in earnings per\nshare considerably less impressive than it might appear at first\nglance.\n\nWe expect difficulty in matching our 1977 rate of return\nduring the forthcoming year. Beginning equity capital is up 23%\nfrom a year ago, and we expect the trend of insurance\nunderwriting profit margins to turn down well before the end of\nthe year. Nevertheless, we expect a reasonably good year and our\npresent estimate, subject to the usual caveats regarding the\nfrailties of forecasts, is that operating earnings will improve\nsomewhat on a per share basis during 1978.\n\nTextile Operations", "char_count": 2733, "word_count": 429, "position_in_letter": 0.0, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}

It was early in 1967 that we made our entry into this\nindustry through the purchase of National Indemnity Company and\nNational Fire and Marine Insurance Company (sister companies) for\napproximately $8.6 million. In that year their premium volume\namounted to $22 million. In 1977 our aggregate insurance premium\nvolume was $151 million. No additional shares of Berkshire\nHathaway stock have been issued to achieve any of this growth.\n\nRather, this almost 600% increase has been achieved through\nlarge gains in National Indemnitys traditional liability areas\nplus the starting of new companies (Cornhusker Casualty Company\nin 1970, Lakeland Fire and Casualty Company in 1971, Texas United\nInsurance Company in 1972, The Insurance Company of Iowa in 1973,\nand Kansas Fire and Casualty Company in late 1977), the purchase\nfor cash of other insurance companies (Home and Automobile\nInsurance Company in 1971, Kerkling Reinsurance Corporation, now\nnamed Central Fire and Casualty Company, in 1976, and Cypress\nInsurance Company at yearend 1977), and finally through the\nmarketing of additional products, most significantly reinsurance,\nwithin the National Indemnity Company corporate structure.\n\nIn aggregate, the insurance business has worked out very\nwell. But it hasnt been a one-way street. Some major mistakes\nhave been made during the decade, both in products and personnel.\nWe experienced significant problems from (1) a surety operation\ninitiated in 1969, (2) the 1973 expansion of Home and\nAutomobiles urban auto marketing into the Miami, Florida area,\n(3) a still unresolved aviation fronting arrangement, and (4)\nour Workers Compensation operation in California, which we\nbelieve retains an interesting potential upon completion of a\nreorganization now in progress. It is comforting to be in a\nbusiness where some mistakes can be made and yet a quite\nsatisfactory overall performance can be achieved. In a sense,\nthis is the opposite case from our textile business where even\nvery good management probably can average only modest results.\nOne of the lessons your management has learned - and,\nunfortunately, sometimes re-learned - is the importance of being\nin businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds.\n\nIn 1977 the winds in insurance underwriting were squarely\nbehind us. Very large rate increases were effected throughout\nthe industry in 1976 to offset the disastrous underwriting\nresults of 1974 and 1975. But, because insurance policies\ntypically are written for one-year periods, with pricing mistakes\ncapable of correction only upon renewal, it was 1977 before the\nfull impact was felt upon earnings of those earlier rate\nincreases.\n\nThe pendulum now is beginning to swing the other way. We\nestimate that costs involved in the insurance areas in which we\noperate rise at close to 1% per month. This is due to continuous\nmonetary inflation affecting the cost of repairing humans and\nproperty, as well as social inflation, a broadening definition\nby society and juries of what is covered by insurance policies.\nUnless rates rise at a comparable 1% per month, underwriting\nprofits must shrink. Recently the pace of rate increases has\nslowed dramatically, and it is our expectation that underwriting\nmargins generally will be declining by the second half of the\nyear.\n\nWe must again give credit to Phil Liesche, greatly assisted\nby Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims, for an\nextraordinary underwriting achievement in National Indemnitys\ntraditional auto and general liability business during 1977.\nLarge volume gains have been accompanied by excellent\nunderwriting margins following contraction or withdrawal by many\ncompetitors in the wake of the 1974-75 crisis period. These\nconditions will reverse before long. In the meantime, National\nIndemnitys underwriting profitability has increased dramatically\nand, in addition, large sums have been made available for\ninvestment. As markets loosen and rates become inadequate, we\nagain will face the challenge of philosophically accepting\nreduced volume. Unusual managerial discipline will be required,\nas it runs counter to normal institutional behavior to let the\nother fellow take away business - even at foolish prices.\n\nOur reinsurance department, managed by George Young,\nimproved its underwriting performance during 1977. Although the\ncombined ratio (see definition on page 12) of 107.1 was\nunsatisfactory, its trend was downward throughout the year. In\naddition, reinsurance generates unusually high funds for\ninvestment as a percentage of premium volume.\n\nAt Home and Auto, John Seward continued to make progress on\nall fronts. John was a battlefield promotion several years ago\nwhen Home and Autos underwriting was awash in red ink and the\ncompany faced possible extinction. Under his management it\ncurrently is sound, profitable, and growing.\n\nJohn Ringwalts homestate operation now consists of five\ncompanies, with Kansas Fire and Casualty Company becoming\noperational late in 1977 under the direction of Floyd Taylor.\nThe homestate companies had net premium volume of $23 million, up\nfrom $5.5 million just three years ago. All four companies that\noperated throughout the year achieved combined ratios below 100,\nwith Cornhusker Casualty Company, at 93.8, the leader. In\naddition to actively supervising the other four homestate\noperations, John Ringwalt manages the operations of Cornhusker\nwhich has recorded combined ratios below 100 in six of its seven\nfull years of existence and, from a standing start in 1970, has\ngrown to be one of the leading insurance companies operating in\nNebraska utilizing the conventional independent agency system.\nLakeland Fire and Casualty Company, managed by Jim Stodolka, was\nthe winner of the Chairmans Cup in 1977 for achieving the lowest\nloss ratio among the homestate companies. All in all, the\nhomestate operation continues to make excellent progress.\n\nThe newest addition to our insurance group is Cypress\nInsurance Company of South Pasadena, California. This Workers\nCompensation insurer was purchased for cash in the final days of\n1977 and, therefore, its approximate $12.5 million of volume for\nthat year was not included in our results. Cypress and National\nIndemnitys present California Workers Compensation operation\nwill not be combined, but will operate independently utilizing\nsomewhat different marketing strategies. Milt Thornton,\nPresident of Cypress since 1968, runs a first-class operation for\npolicyholders, agents, employees and owners alike. We look\nforward to working with him.\n\nInsurance companies offer standardized policies which can be\ncopied by anyone. Their only products are promises. It is not\ndifficult to be licensed, and rates are an open book.
