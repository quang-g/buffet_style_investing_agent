Though they\nreclassify and reduce accounting earnings, the changes are\nentirely of form, not of substance. The story behind the\nchanges, however, is interesting.\n\nAs reported last year: (1) in mid-1983 GEICO made a tender\noffer to buy its own shares; (2) at the same time, we agreed by\nwritten contract to sell GEICO an amount of its shares that would\nbe proportionately related to the aggregate number of shares\nGEICO repurchased via the tender from all other shareholders; (3)\nat completion of the tender, we delivered 350,000 shares to\nGEICO, received $21 million cash, and were left owning exactly\nthe same percentage of GEICO that we owned before the tender; (4)\nGEICOs transaction with us amounted to a proportionate\nredemption, an opinion rendered us, without qualification, by a\nleading law firm; (5) the Tax Code logically regards such\nproportionate redemptions as substantially equivalent to\ndividends and, therefore, the $21 million we received was taxed\nat only the 6.9% inter-corporate dividend rate; (6) importantly,\nthat $21 million was far less than the previously-undistributed\nearnings that had inured to our ownership in GEICO and, thus,\nfrom the standpoint of economic substance, was in our view\nequivalent to a dividend.\n\nBecause it was material and unusual, we highlighted the\nGEICO distribution last year to you, both in the applicable\nquarterly report and in this section of the annual report.\nAdditionally, we emphasized the transaction to our auditors,\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. Both the Omaha office of Peat\nMarwick and the reviewing Chicago partner, without objection,\nconcurred with our dividend presentation.\n\nIn 1984, we had a virtually identical transaction with\nGeneral Foods. The only difference was that General Foods\nrepurchased its stock over a period of time in the open market,\nwhereas GEICO had made a one-shot tender offer. In the General\nFoods case we sold to the company, on each day that it\nrepurchased shares, a quantity of shares that left our ownership\npercentage precisely unchanged. Again our transaction was\npursuant to a written contract executed before repurchases began.\nAnd again the money we received was far less than the retained\nearnings that had inured to our ownership interest since our\npurchase. Overall we received $21,843,601 in cash from General\nFoods, and our ownership remained at exactly 8.75%.\n\nAt this point the New York office of Peat Marwick came into\nthe picture. Late in 1984 it indicated that it disagreed with\nthe conclusions of the firms Omaha office and Chicago reviewing\npartner. The New York view was that the GEICO and General Foods\ntransactions should be treated as sales of stock by Berkshire\nrather than as the receipt of dividends. Under this accounting\napproach, a portion of the cost of our investment in the stock of\neach company would be charged against the redemption payment and\nany gain would be shown as a capital gain, not as dividend\nincome. This is an accounting approach only, having no bearing\non taxes: Peat Marwick agrees that the transactions were\ndividends for IRS purposes.\n\nWe disagree with the New York position from both the\nviewpoint of economic substance and proper accounting. But, to\navoid a qualified auditors opinion, we have adopted herein Peat\nMarwicks 1984 view and restated 1983 accordingly. None of this,\nhowever, has any effect on intrinsic business value: our\nownership interests in GEICO and General Foods, our cash, our\ntaxes, and the market value and tax basis of our holdings all\nremain the same.\n\nThis year we have again entered into a contract with General\nFoods whereby we will sell them shares concurrently with open\nmarket purchases that they make. The arrangement provides that\nour ownership interest will remain unchanged at all times. By\nkeeping it so, we will insure ourselves dividend treatment for\ntax purposes. In our view also, the economic substance of this\ntransaction again is the creation of dividend income. However,\nwe will account for the redemptions as sales of stock rather than\ndividend income unless accounting rules are adopted that speak\ndirectly to this point. We will continue to prominently identify\nany such special transactions in our reports to you.", "char_count": 4378, "word_count": 710, "position_in_letter": 0.059392, "position_in_section": 1, "total_chunks_in_section": 3}

When companies with outstanding businesses and\ncomfortable financial positions find their shares selling far\nbelow intrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action\ncan benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases.\n\n(Our endorsement of repurchases is limited to those dictated\nby price/value relationships and does not extend to the\ngreenmail repurchase - a practice we find odious and repugnant.\nIn these transactions, two parties achieve their personal ends by\nexploitation of an innocent and unconsulted third party. The\nplayers are: (1) the shareholder extortionist who, even before\nthe ink on his stock certificate dries, delivers his yourmoney-or-your-life message to managers; (2) the corporate\ninsiders who quickly seek peace at any price - as long as the\nprice is paid by someone else; and (3) the shareholders whose\nmoney is used by (2) to make (1) go away. As the dust settles,\nthe mugging, transient shareholder gives his speech on free\nenterprise, the muggee management gives its speech on the best\ninterests of the company, and the innocent shareholder standing\nby mutely funds the payoff.)\n\nThe companies in which we have our largest investments have\nall engaged in significant stock repurhases at times when wide\ndiscrepancies existed between price and value. As shareholders,\nwe find this encouraging and rewarding for two important reasons\n- one that is obvious, and one that is subtle and not always\nunderstood. The obvious point involves basic arithmetic: major\nrepurchases at prices well below per-share intrinsic business\nvalue immediately increase, in a highly significant way, that\nvalue. When companies purchase their own stock, they often find\nit easy to get $2 of present value for $1. Corporate acquisition\nprograms almost never do as well and, in a discouragingly large\nnumber of cases, fail to get anything close to $1 of value for\neach $1 expended.\n\nThe other benefit of repurchases is less subject to precise\nmeasurement but can be fully as important over time. By making\nrepurchases when a companys market value is well below its\nbusiness value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given\nto actions that enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than\nto actions that expand managements domain but that do nothing\nfor (or even harm) shareholders. Seeing this, shareholders and\npotential shareholders increase their estimates of future returns\nfrom the business. This upward revision, in turn, produces\nmarket prices more in line with intrinsic business value. These\nprices are entirely rational. Investors should pay more for a\nbusiness that is lodged in the hands of a manager with\ndemonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands\nof a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer. (To\nmake the point extreme, how much would you pay to be a minority\nshareholder of a company controlled by Robert Wesco?)\n\nThe key word is demonstrated. A manager who consistently\nturns his back on repurchases, when these clearly are in the\ninterests of owners, reveals more than he knows of his\nmotivations. No matter how often or how eloquently he mouths\nsome public relations-inspired phrase such as maximizing\nshareholder wealth (this seasons favorite), the market\ncorrectly discounts assets lodged with him.

I told you they were terrific, and I understated the\ncase. After another year of observing their remarkable talents\nand character, I can honestly say that I never have seen a\nmanagerial group that either functions or behaves better than the\nBlumkin family.\n\nMrs. B, Chairman of the Board, is now 91, and recently was\nquoted in the local newspaper as saying, I come home to eat and\nsleep, and thats about it. I cant wait until it gets daylight\nso I can get back to the business. Mrs. B is at the store seven\ndays a week, from opening to close, and probably makes more\ndecisions in a day than most CEOs do in a year (better ones,\ntoo).\n\nIn May Mrs. B was granted an Honorary Doctorate in\nCommercial Science by New York University. (Shes a fast track\nstudent: not one day in her life was spent in a school room prior\nto her receipt of the doctorate.) Previous recipients of honorary\ndegrees in business from NYU include Clifton Garvin, Jr., CEO of\nExxon Corp.; Walter Wriston, then CEO of Citicorp; Frank Cary,\nthen CEO of IBM; Tom Murphy, then CEO of General Motors; and,\nmost recently, Paul Volcker. (They are in good company.)\n\nThe Blumkin blood did not run thin. Louie, Mrs. Bs son,\nand his three boys, Ron, Irv, and Steve, all contribute in full\nmeasure to NFMs amazing success. The younger generation has\nattended the best business school of them all - that conducted by\nMrs. B and Louie - and their training is evident in their\nperformance.\n\nLast year NFMs net sales increased by $14.3 million,\nbringing the total to $115 million, all from the one store in\nOmaha. That is by far the largest volume produced by a single\nhome furnishings store in the United States. In fact, the gain\nin sales last year was itself greater than the annual volume of\nmany good-sized successful stores. The business achieves this\nsuccess because it deserves this success. A few figures will\ntell you why.\n\nIn its fiscal 1984 10-K, the largest independent specialty\nretailer of home furnishings in the country, Levitz Furniture,\ndescribed its prices as generally lower than the prices charged\nby conventional furniture stores in its trading area. Levitz,\nin that year, operated at a gross margin of 44.4% (that is, on\naverage, customers paid it $100 for merchandise that had cost it\n$55.60 to buy). The gross margin at NFM is not much more than\nhalf of that. NFMs low mark-ups are possible because of its\nexceptional efficiency: operating expenses (payroll, occupancy,\nadvertising, etc.) are about 16.5% of sales versus 35.6% at\nLevitz.\n\nNone of this is in criticism of Levitz, which has a wellmanaged operation. But the NFM operation is simply extraordinary\n(and, remember, it all comes from a $500 investment by Mrs. B in\n1937). By unparalleled efficiency and astute volume purchasing,\nNFM is able to earn excellent returns on capital while saving its\ncustomers at least $30 million annually from what, on average, it\nwould cost them to buy the same merchandise at stores maintaining\ntypical mark-ups. Such savings enable NFM to constantly widen\nits geographical reach and thus to enjoy growth well beyond the\nnatural growth of the Omaha market.", "char_count": 3221, "word_count": 559, "position_in_letter": 0.195387, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 2}

Phil Graham, when publisher\nof the Washington Post, described the daily newspaper as a first\nrough draft of history. Unfortunately, the financial statements\nof a property/casualty insurer provide, at best, only a first\nrough draft of earnings and financial condition.\n\nThe determination of costs is the main problem. Most of an\ninsurers costs result from losses on claims, and many of the\nlosses that should be charged against the current years revenue\nare exceptionally difficult to estimate. Sometimes the extent of\nthese losses, or even their existence, is not known for decades.\n\nThe loss expense charged in a property/casualty companys\ncurrent income statement represents: (1) losses that occurred and\nwere paid during the year; (2) estimates for losses that occurred\nand were reported to the insurer during the year, but which have\nyet to be settled; (3) estimates of ultimate dollar costs for\nlosses that occurred during the year but of which the insurer is\nunaware (termed IBNR: incurred but not reported); and (4) the\nnet effect of revisions this year of similar estimates for (2)\nand (3) made in past years.\n\nSuch revisions may be long delayed, but eventually any\nestimate of losses that causes the income for year X to be\nmisstated must be corrected, whether it is in year X + 1, or\nX + 10. This, perforce, means that earnings in the year of\ncorrection also are misstated. For example, assume a claimant\nwas injured by one of our insureds in 1979 and we thought a\nsettlement was likely to be made for $10,000. That year we would\nhave charged $10,000 to our earnings statement for the estimated\ncost of the loss and, correspondingly, set up a liability reserve\non the balance sheet for that amount. If we settled the claim in\n1984 for $100,000, we would charge earnings with a loss cost of\n$90,000 in 1984, although that cost was truly an expense of 1979.\nAnd if that piece of business was our only activity in 1979, we\nwould have badly misled ourselves as to costs, and you as to\nearnings.\n\nThe necessarily-extensive use of estimates in assembling the\nfigures that appear in such deceptively precise form in the\nincome statement of property/casualty companies means that some\nerror must seep in, no matter how proper the intentions of\nmanagement. In an attempt to minimize error, most insurers use\nvarious statistical techniques to adjust the thousands of\nindividual loss evaluations (called case reserves) that comprise\nthe raw data for estimation of aggregate liabilities. The extra\nreserves created by these adjustments are variously labeled\nbulk, development, or supplemental reserves.

I will continue to report to\nyou the errors, plus or minus, that surface each year.\n\nNot all reserving errors in the industry have been of the\ninnocent-but-dumb variety. With underwriting results as bad as\nthey have been in recent years - and with managements having as\nmuch discretion as they do in the presentation of financial\nstatements - some unattractive aspects of human nature have\nmanifested themselves. Companies that would be out of business\nif they realistically appraised their loss costs have, in some\ncases, simply preferred to take an extraordinarily optimistic\nview about these yet-to-be-paid sums. Others have engaged in\nvarious transactions to hide true current loss costs.\n\nBoth of these approaches can work for a considerable time:\nexternal auditors cannot effectively police the financial\nstatements of property/casualty insurers. If liabilities of an\ninsurer, correctly stated, would exceed assets, it falls to the\ninsurer to volunteer this morbid information. In other words,\nthe corpse is supposed to file the death certificate. Under this\nhonor system of mortality, the corpse sometimes gives itself\nthe benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn most businesses, of course, insolvent companies run out\nof cash. Insurance is different: you can be broke but flush.\nSince cash comes in at the inception of an insurance policy and\nlosses are paid much later, insolvent insurers dont run out of\ncash until long after they have run out of net worth. In fact,\nthese walking dead often redouble their efforts to write\nbusiness, accepting almost any price or risk, simply to keep the\ncash flowing in. With an attitude like that of an embezzler who\nhas gambled away his purloined funds, these companies hope that\nsomehow they can get lucky on the next batch of business and\nthereby cover up earlier shortfalls. Even if they dont get\nlucky, the penalty to managers is usually no greater for a $100\nmillion shortfall than one of $10 million; in the meantime, while\nthe losses mount, the managers keep their jobs and perquisites.\n\nThe loss-reserving errors of other property/casualty\ncompanies are of more than academic interest to Berkshire. Not\nonly does Berkshire suffer from sell-at-any-price competition by\nthe walking dead, but we also suffer when their insolvency is\nfinally acknowledged. Through various state guarantee funds that\nlevy assessments, Berkshire ends up paying a portion of the\ninsolvent insurers asset deficiencies, swollen as they usually\nare by the delayed detection that results from wrong reporting.\nThere is even some potential for cascading trouble. The\ninsolvency of a few large insurers and the assessments by state\nguarantee funds that would follow could imperil weak-butpreviously-solvent insurers.

This is the same entity that, on July 1,1983,\ndefaulted on $2.2 billion of bonds issued to finance partial\nconstruction of the now-abandoned Projects 4 and 5.

In addition, there have been a multitude of problems\nrelated directly to Projects 1,2, and 3 that could weaken or\ndestroy an otherwise strong credit position arising from\nguarantees by Bonneville Power Administration.\n\nDespite these important negatives, Charlie and I judged the\nrisks\nat the time we purchased the bonds and at the prices\nBerkshire paid\n(much lower than present prices) to be\nconsiderably more than compensated for by prospects of profit.\n\nAs you know, we buy marketable stocks for our insurance\ncompanies based upon the criteria we would apply in the purchase\nof an entire business. This business-valuation approach is not\nwidespread among professional money managers and is scorned by\nmany academics. Nevertheless, it has served its followers well\n(to which the academics seem to say, Well, it may be all right\nin practice, but it will never work in theory.) Simply put, we\nfeel that if we can buy small pieces of businesses with\nsatisfactory underlying economics at a fraction of the per-share\nvalue of the entire business, something good is likely to happen\nto us - particularly if we own a group of such securities.\n\nWe extend this business-valuation approach even to bond\npurchases such as WPPSS. We compare the $139 million cost of our\nyearend investment in WPPSS to a similar $139 million investment\nin an operating business. In the case of WPPSS, the business\ncontractually earns $22.7 million after tax (via the interest\npaid on the bonds), and those earnings are available to us\ncurrently in cash. We are unable to buy operating businesses\nwith economics close to these. Only a relatively few businesses\nearn the 16.3% after tax on unleveraged capital that our WPPSS\ninvestment does and those businesses, when available for\npurchase, sell at large premiums to that capital. In the average\nnegotiated business transaction, unleveraged corporate earnings\nof $22.7 million after-tax (equivalent to about $45 million pretax) might command a price of $250 - $300 million (or sometimes\nfar more). For a business we understand well and strongly like,\nwe will gladly pay that much. But it is double the price we paid\nto realize the same earnings from WPPSS bonds.\n\nHowever, in the case of WPPSS, there is what we view to be a\nvery slight risk that the business could be worth nothing\nwithin a year or two. There also is the risk that interest\npayments might be interrupted for a considerable period of time.\nFurthermore, the most that the business could be worth is about\nthe $205 million face value of the bonds that we own, an amount\nonly 48% higher than the price we paid.\n\nThis ceiling on upside potential is an important minus. It\nshould be realized, however, that the great majority of operating\nbusinesses have a limited upside potential also unless more\ncapital is continuously invested in them. That is so because\nmost businesses are unable to significantly improve their average\nreturns on equity - even under inflationary conditions, though\nthese were once thought to automatically raise returns.\n\n(Lets push our bond-as-a-business example one notch\nfurther: if you elect to retain the annual earnings of a 12%\nbond by using the proceeds from coupons to buy more bonds,\nearnings of that bond business will grow at a rate comparable\nto that of most operating businesses that similarly reinvest all\nearnings. In the first instance, a 30-year, zero-coupon, 12%\nbond purchased today for $10 million will be worth $300 million\nin 2015. In the second, a $10 million business that regularly\nearns 12% on equity and retains all earnings to grow, will also\nend up with $300 million of capital in 2015. Both the business\nand the bond will earn over $32 million in the final year.)\n\nOur approach to bond investment - treating it as an unusual\nsort of business with special advantages and disadvantages -\nmay strike you as a bit quirky. However, we believe that many\nstaggering errors by investors could have been avoided if they\nhad viewed bond investment with a businessmans perspective. For\nexample, in 1946,20-year AAA tax-exempt bonds traded at slightly\nbelow a 1% yield. In effect, the buyer of those bonds at that\ntime bought a business that earned about 1% on book value\n(and that, moreover, could never earn a dime more than 1% on\nbook), and paid 100 cents on the dollar for that abominable\nbusiness.\n\nIf an investor had been business-minded enough to think in\nthose terms - and that was the precise reality of the bargain\nstruck - he would have laughed at the proposition and walked\naway. For, at the same time, businesses with excellent future\nprospects could have been bought at, or close to, book value\nwhile earning 10%, 12%, or 15% after tax on book. Probably no\nbusiness in America changed hands in 1946 at book value that the\nbuyer believed lacked the ability to earn more than 1% on book.\nBut investors with bond-buying habits eagerly made economic\ncommitments throughout the year on just that basis. Similar,\nalthough less extreme, conditions prevailed for the next two\ndecades as bond investors happily signed up for twenty or thirty\nyears on terms outrageously inadequate by business standards.\n(In what I think is by far the best book on investing ever\nwritten - The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham - the last\nsection of the last chapter begins with, Investment is most\nintelligent when it is most businesslike. This section is called\nA Final Word, and it is appropriately titled.)\n\nWe will emphasize again that there is unquestionably some\nrisk in the WPPSS commitment. It is also the sort of risk that\nis difficult to evaluate. Were Charlie and I to deal with 50\nsimilar evaluations over a lifetime, we would expect our judgment\nto prove reasonably satisfactory. But we do not get the chance\nto make 50 or even 5 such decisions in a single year. Even\nthough our long-term results may turn out fine, in any given year\nwe run a risk that we will look extraordinarily foolish. (Thats\nwhy all of these sentences say Charlie and I, or we.)\n\nMost managers have very little incentive to make the\nintelligent-but-with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot\ndecision. Their personal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if\nan unconventional decision works out well, they get a pat on the\nback and, if it works out poorly, they get a pink slip. (Failing\nconventionally is the route to go; as a group, lemmings may have\na rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever received bad\npress.)\n\nOur equation is different. With 47% of Berkshires stock,\nCharlie and I dont worry about being fired, and we receive our\nrewards as owners, not managers. Thus we behave with Berkshires\nmoney as we would with our own. That frequently leads us to\nunconventional behavior both in investments and general business\nmanagement.\n\nWe remain unconventional in the degree to which we\nconcentrate the investments of our insurance companies, including\nthose in WPPSS bonds. This concentration makes sense only\nbecause our insurance business is conducted from a position of\nexceptional financial strength. For almost all other insurers, a\ncomparable degree of concentration (or anything close to it)\nwould be totally inappropriate. Their capital positions are not\nstrong enough to withstand a big error, no matter how attractive\nan investment opportunity might appear when analyzed on the basis\nof probabilities.\n\nWith our financial strength we can own large blocks of a few\nsecurities that we have thought hard about and bought at\nattractive prices. (Billy Rose described the problem of overdiversification: If you have a harem of forty women, you never\nget to know any of them very well.) Over time our policy of\nconcentration should produce superior results, though these will\nbe tempered by our large size. When this policy produces a\nreally bad year, as it must, at least you will know that our\nmoney was committed on the same basis as yours.\n\nWe made the major part of our WPPSS investment at different\nprices and under somewhat different factual circumstances than\nexist at present. If we decide to change our position, we will\nnot inform shareholders until long after the change has been\ncompleted. (We may be buying or selling as you read this.) The\nbuying and selling of securities is a competitive business, and\neven a modest amount of added competition on either side can cost\nus a great deal of money. Our WPPSS purchases illustrate this\nprinciple. From October, 1983 through June, 1984, we attempted\nto buy almost all the bonds that we could of Projects 1,2, and\n3. Yet we purchased less than 3% of the bonds outstanding. Had\nwe faced even a few additional well-heeled investors, stimulated\nto buy because they knew we were, we could have ended up with a\nmaterially smaller amount of bonds, purchased at a materially\nhigher price. (A couple of coat-tail riders easily could have\ncost us $5 million.) For this reason, we will not comment about\nour activities in securities - neither to the press, nor\nshareholders, nor to anyone else - unless legally required to do\nso.", "char_count": 9652, "word_count": 1618, "position_in_letter": 0.624445, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}

And thats it -\nno analysis will be supplied as to why that particular policy is\nbest for the owners of the business. Yet, allocation of capital\nis crucial to business and investment management. Because it is,\nwe believe managers and owners should think hard about the\ncircumstances under which earnings should be retained and under\nwhich they should be distributed.\n\nThe first point to understand is that all earnings are not\ncreated equal. In many businesses particularly those that have\nhigh asset/profit ratios - inflation causes some or all of the\nreported earnings to become ersatz. The ersatz portion - lets\ncall these earnings restricted - cannot, if the business is to\nretain its economic position, be distributed as dividends. Were\nthese earnings to be paid out, the business would lose ground in\none or more of the following areas: its ability to maintain its\nunit volume of sales, its long-term competitive position, its\nfinancial strength. No matter how conservative its payout ratio,\na company that consistently distributes restricted earnings is\ndestined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise infused.\n\nRestricted earnings are seldom valueless to owners, but they\noften must be discounted heavily. In effect, they are\nconscripted by the business, no matter how poor its economic\npotential. (This retention-no-matter-how-unattractive-the-return\nsituation was communicated unwittingly in a marvelously ironic\nway by Consolidated Edison a decade ago. At the time, a punitive\nregulatory policy was a major factor causing the companys stock\nto sell as low as one-fourth of book value; i. e., every time a\ndollar of earnings was retained for reinvestment in the business,\nthat dollar was transformed into only 25 cents of market value.\nBut, despite this gold-into-lead process, most earnings were\nreinvested in the business rather than paid to owners.\nMeanwhile, at construction and maintenance sites throughout New\nYork, signs proudly proclaimed the corporate slogan, Dig We\nMust.)\n\nRestricted earnings need not concern us further in this\ndividend discussion. Lets turn to the much-more-valued\nunrestricted variety. These earnings may, with equal\nfeasibility, be retained or distributed. In our opinion,\nmanagement should choose whichever course makes greater sense for\nthe owners of the business.\n\nThis principle is not universally accepted. For a number of\nreasons managers like to withhold unrestricted, readily\ndistributable earnings from shareholders - to expand the\ncorporate empire over which the managers rule, to operate from a\nposition of exceptional financial comfort, etc. But we believe\nthere is only one valid reason for retention. Unrestricted\nearnings should be retained only when there is a reasonable\nprospect - backed preferably by historical evidence or, when\nappropriate, by a thoughtful analysis of the future - that\nfor\nevery dollar retained by the corporation, at least one dollar of\nmarket value will be created for owners.\nThis will happen only\nif the capital retained produces incremental earnings equal to,\nor above, those generally available to investors.\n\nTo illustrate, lets assume that an investor owns a riskfree 10% perpetual bond with one very unusual feature. Each year\nthe investor can elect either to take his 10% coupon in cash, or\nto reinvest the coupon in more 10% bonds with identical terms;\ni. e., a perpetual life and coupons offering the same cash-orreinvest option. If, in any given year, the prevailing interest\nrate on long-term, risk-free bonds is 5%, it would be foolish for\nthe investor to take his coupon in cash since the 10% bonds he\ncould instead choose would be worth considerably more than 100\ncents on the dollar. Under these circumstances, the investor\nwanting to get his hands on cash should take his coupon in\nadditional bonds and then immediately sell them. By doing that,\nhe would realize more cash than if he had taken his coupon\ndirectly in cash. Assuming all bonds were held by rational\ninvestors, no one would opt for cash in an era of 5% interest\nrates, not even those bondholders needing cash for living\npurposes.\n\nIf, however, interest rates were 15%, no rational investor\nwould want his money invested for him at 10%. Instead, the\ninvestor would choose to take his coupon in cash, even if his\npersonal cash needs were nil. The opposite course - reinvestment\nof the coupon - would give an investor additional bonds with\nmarket value far less than the cash he could have elected. If he\nshould want 10% bonds, he can simply take the cash received\nand buy them in the market, where they will be available at a\nlarge discount.\n\nAn analysis similar to that made by our hypothetical\nbondholder is appropriate for owners in thinking about whether a\ncompanys unrestricted earnings should be retained or paid out.\nOf course, the analysis is much more difficult and subject to\nerror because the rate earned on reinvested earnings is not a\ncontractual figure, as in our bond case, but rather a fluctuating\nfigure. Owners must guess as to what the rate will average over\nthe intermediate future. However, once an informed guess is\nmade, the rest of the analysis is simple: you should wish your\nearnings to be reinvested if they can be expected to earn high\nreturns, and you should wish them paid to you if low returns are\nthe likely outcome of reinvestment.\n\nMany corporate managers reason very much along these lines\nin determining whether subsidiaries should distribute earnings to\ntheir parent company. At that level,. the managers have no\ntrouble thinking like intelligent owners. But payout decisions\nat the parent company level often are a different story. Here\nmanagers frequently have trouble putting themselves in the shoes\nof their shareholder-owners.\n\nWith this schizoid approach, the CEO of a multi-divisional\ncompany will instruct Subsidiary A, whose earnings on incremental\ncapital may be expected to average 5%, to distribute all\navailable earnings in order that they may be invested in\nSubsidiary B, whose earnings on incremental capital are expected\nto be 15%. The CEOs business school oath will allow no lesser\nbehavior. But if his own long-term record with incremental\ncapital is 5% - and market rates are 10% - he is likely to impose\na dividend policy on shareholders of the parent company that\nmerely follows some historical or industry-wide payout pattern.\nFurthermore, he will expect managers of subsidiaries to give him\na full account as to why it makes sense for earnings to be\nretained in their operations rather than distributed to the\nparent-owner. But seldom will he supply his owners with a\nsimilar analysis pertaining to the whole company.\n\nIn judging whether managers should retain earnings,\nshareholders should not simply compare total incremental earnings\nin recent years to total incremental capital because that\nrelationship may be distorted by what is going on in a core\nbusiness. During an inflationary period, companies with a core\nbusiness characterized by extraordinary economics can use small\namounts of incremental capital in that business at very high\nrates of return (as was discussed in last years section on\nGoodwill). But, unless they are experiencing tremendous unit\ngrowth, outstanding businesses by definition generate large\namounts of excess cash. If a company sinks most of this money in\nother businesses that earn low returns, the companys overall\nreturn on retained capital may nevertheless appear excellent\nbecause of the extraordinary returns being earned by the portion\nof earnings incrementally invested in the core business. The\nsituation is analogous to a Pro-Am golf event: even if all of the\namateurs are hopeless duffers, the teams best-ball score will be\nrespectable because of the dominating skills of the professional.", "char_count": 8008, "word_count": 1293, "position_in_letter": 0.76879, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}

The\nmanagers at fault periodically report on the lessons they have\nlearned from the latest disappointment. They then usually seek\nout future lessons. (Failure seems to go to their heads.)\n\nIn such cases, shareholders would be far better off if\nearnings were retained only to expand the high-return business,\nwith the balance paid in dividends or used to repurchase stock\n(an action that increases the owners interest in the exceptional\nbusiness while sparing them participation in subpar businesses).\nManagers of high-return businesses who consistently employ much\nof the cash thrown off by those businesses in other ventures with\nlow returns should be held to account for those allocation\ndecisions, regardless of how profitable the overall enterprise\nis.\n\nNothing in this discussion is intended to argue for\ndividends that bounce around from quarter to quarter with each\nwiggle in earnings or in investment opportunities. Shareholders\nof public corporations understandably prefer that dividends be\nconsistent and predictable. Payments, therefore, should reflect\nlong-term expectations for both earnings and returns on\nincremental capital. Since the long-term corporate outlook\nchanges only infrequently, dividend patterns should change no\nmore often. But over time distributable earnings that have been\nwithheld by managers should earn their keep. If earnings have\nbeen unwisely retained, it is likely that managers, too, have\nbeen unwisely retained.\n\nLets now turn to Berkshire Hathaway and examine how these\ndividend principles apply to it. Historically, Berkshire has\nearned well over market rates on retained earnings, thereby\ncreating over one dollar of market value for every dollar\nretained. Under such circumstances, any distribution would have\nbeen contrary to the financial interest of shareholders, large or\nsmall.\n\nIn fact, significant distributions in the early years might\nhave been disastrous, as a review of our starting position will\nshow you. Charlie and I then controlled and managed three\ncompanies, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Diversified Retailing\nCompany, Inc., and Blue Chip Stamps (all now merged into our\npresent operation). Blue Chip paid only a small dividend,\nBerkshire and DRC paid nothing. If, instead, the companies had\npaid out their entire earnings, we almost certainly would have no\nearnings at all now - and perhaps no capital as well. The three\ncompanies each originally made their money from a single\nbusiness: (1) textiles at Berkshire; (2) department stores at\nDiversified; and (3) trading stamps at Blue Chip. These\ncornerstone businesses (carefully chosen, it should be noted, by\nyour Chairman and Vice Chairman) have, respectively, (1) survived\nbut earned almost nothing, (2) shriveled in size while incurring\nlarge losses, and (3) shrunk in sales volume to about 5% its size\nat the time of our entry. (Who says you cant lose em all?)\nOnly by committing available funds to much better businesses were\nwe able to overcome these origins. (Its been like overcoming a\nmisspent youth.) Clearly, diversification has served us well.\n\nWe expect to continue to diversify while also supporting the\ngrowth of current operations though, as weve pointed out, our\nreturns from these efforts will surely be below our historical\nreturns. But as long as prospective returns are above the rate\nrequired to produce a dollar of market value per dollar retained,\nwe will continue to retain all earnings. Should our estimate of\nfuture returns fall below that point, we will distribute all\nunrestricted earnings that we believe can not be effectively\nused.

Many annual meetings are a waste of time,\nboth for shareholders and for management. Sometimes that is true\nbecause management is reluctant to open up on matters of business\nsubstance. More often a nonproductive session is the fault of\nshareholder participants who are more concerned about their own\nmoment on stage than they are about the affairs of the\ncorporation. What should be a forum for business discussion\nbecomes a forum for theatrics, spleen-venting and advocacy of\nissues.

Our activities in securities would be the\nmain example.\n\nWe always have bragged a bit on these pages about the\nquality of our shareholder-partners.
