This decline largely resulted from:\n\n(1) a significant deterioration in insurance underwriting\nresults;\n\n(2) a considerable expansion of equity capital without a\ncorresponding growth in the businesses we operate\ndirectly; and\n\n(3) a continually-enlarging commitment of our resources to\ninvestment in partially-owned, nonoperated businesses;\naccounting rules dictate that a major part of our\npro-rata share of earnings from such businesses must be\nexcluded from Berkshires reported earnings.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that we told you that the\noperating earnings/equity capital percentage, with proper\nallowance for a few other variables, was the most important\nyardstick of single-year managerial performance. While we still\nbelieve this to be the case with the vast majority of companies,\nwe believe its utility in our own case has greatly diminished.\nYou should be suspicious of such an assertion. Yardsticks seldom\nare discarded while yielding favorable readings. But when\nresults deteriorate, most managers favor disposition of the\nyardstick rather than disposition of the manager.\n\nTo managers faced with such deterioration, a more flexible\nmeasurement system often suggests itself: just shoot the arrow of\nbusiness performance into a blank canvas and then carefully draw\nthe bullseye around the implanted arrow. We generally believe in\npre-set, long-lived and small bullseyes. However, because of the\nimportance of item (3) above, further explained in the following\nsection, we believe our abandonment of the operating\nearnings/equity capital bullseye to be warranted.\n\nNon-Reported Ownership Earnings\n\nThe appended financial statements reflect accounting\nearnings that generally include our proportionate share of\nearnings from any underlying business in which our ownership is\nat least 20%. Below the 20% ownership figure, however, only our\nshare of dividends paid by the underlying business units is\nincluded in our accounting numbers; undistributed earnings of\nsuch less-than-20%-owned businesses are totally ignored.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this rule; e. g., we own about\n35% of GEICO Corporation but, because we have assigned our voting\nrights, the company is treated for accounting purposes as a lessthan-20% holding.

An additional $23 million that represents\nour share of GEICOs undistributed operating earnings for 1982 is\ntotally excluded from our reported operating earnings. If GEICO\nhad earned less money in 1982 but had paid an additional $1\nmillion in dividends, our reported earnings would have been\nlarger despite the poorer business results. Conversely, if GEICO\nhad earned an additional $100 million - and retained it all - our\nreported earnings would have been unchanged. Clearly\naccounting earnings can seriously misrepresent economic\nreality.\n\nWe prefer a concept of economic earnings that includes all\nundistributed earnings, regardless of ownership percentage. In\nour view, the value to all owners of the retained earnings of a\nbusiness enterprise is determined by the effectiveness with which\nthose earnings are used - and not by the size of ones ownership\npercentage. If you have owned . 01 of 1% of Berkshire during the\npast decade, you have benefited economically in full measure from\nyour share of our retained earnings, no matter what your\naccounting system. Proportionately, you have done just as well\nas if you had owned the magic 20%. But if you have owned 100% of\na great many capital-intensive businesses during the decade,\nretained earnings that were credited fully and with painstaking\nprecision to you under standard accounting methods have resulted\nin minor or zero economic value. This is not a criticism of\naccounting procedures. We would not like to have the job of\ndesigning a better system.

Their magnitude, we believe, is what\nmakes our reported operating earnings figure of limited\nsignificance.\n\nIn our 1981 annual report we predicted that our share of\nundistributed earnings from four of our major non-controlled\nholdings would aggregate over $35 million in 1982.
