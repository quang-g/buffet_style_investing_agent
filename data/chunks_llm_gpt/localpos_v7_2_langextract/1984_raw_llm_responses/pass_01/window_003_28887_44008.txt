    "start_anchor": "Our opinion is proving dismayingly accurate: a premium increase of 10% per year since 1979 would have produced an aggregate increase through 1984 of 61% and a combined ratio in 1984 almost identical to the 100.6 of 1979.",
    "end_anchor": "Instead, we expect several years of premium gains somewhat above the 10% level, followed by highlycompetitive pricing that generally will produce combined ratios in the 108-113 range.",
    "contextual_summary": "Buffett analyzes the insurance industry's premium growth shortfall since 1979, noting that actual increases were only half of the needed 10% annual rise, resulting in worsening combined ratios.

    "contextual_summary": "Buffett candidly reports Berkshire Hathaway's poor underwriting combined ratio of 134 in 1984, worse than the industry average.
