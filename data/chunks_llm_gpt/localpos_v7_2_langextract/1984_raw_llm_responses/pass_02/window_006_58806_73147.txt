Buffett argues that while bonds and stocks perform similarly under moderate inflation, runaway inflation poses a severe risk to bondholders, leading Berkshire to require a high hurdle before purchasing long-term bonds.",

    "contextual_summary": "This chunk introduces the concept that not all earnings are equal, distinguishing between restricted and unrestricted earnings in dividend policy. Buffett emphasizes that restricted earnings cannot be paid out without harming the business's competitive position or financial strength, warning that distributing such earnings leads to long-term decline.",

    "contextual_summary": "This chunk elaborates on unrestricted earnings, arguing they should be retained only if reinvestment produces returns at least equal to market expectations. Buffett uses a hypothetical bond investor example to illustrate the decision process and criticizes managers who retain earnings without creating sufficient value, emphasizing the importance of disciplined capital allocation.",

    "contextual_summary": "This chunk analyzes managerial behavior in dividend decisions, highlighting the disconnect between subsidiary and parent company payout policies. Buffett warns that companies with strong core businesses may mask poor capital allocation in other ventures, urging shareholders to hold managers accountable for retaining earnings in low-return businesses and advocating for dividends or buybacks when appropriate.",
