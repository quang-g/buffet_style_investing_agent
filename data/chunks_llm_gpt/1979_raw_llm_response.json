      "start_anchor": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nAgain, we must lead off with a few words about accounting.\nSince our last annual report, the accounting profession has\ndecided that equity securities owned by insurance companies must\nbe carried on the balance sheet at market value. We previously\nhave carried such equity securities at the lower of aggregate\ncost or aggregate market value. Because we have large unrealized\ngains in our insurance equity holdings, the result of this new\npolicy is to increase substantially both the 1978 and 1979\nyearend net worth, even after the appropriate liability is\nestablished for taxes on capital gains that would be payable\nshould equities be sold at such market valuations.\n\nAs you know, Blue Chip Stamps, our 60% owned subsidiary, is\nfully consolidated in Berkshire Hathaways financial statements.\nHowever, Blue Chip still is required to carry its equity\ninvestments at the lower of aggregate cost or aggregate market\nvalue, just as Berkshire Hathaways insurance subsidiaries did\nprior to this year. Should the same equities be purchased at an\nidentical price by an insurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway\nand by Blue Chip Stamps, present accounting principles often\nwould require that they end up carried on our consolidated\nbalance sheet at two different values. (That should keep you on\nyour toes.) Market values of Blue Chip Stamps equity holdings\nare given in footnote 3 on page 18.1979 Operating Results\n\nWe continue to feel that the ratio of operating earnings\n(before securities gains or losses) to shareholders equity\nwith\nall securities valued at cost\nis the most appropriate way to\nmeasure any single years operating performance.\n\nMeasuring such results against shareholders equity with\nsecurities valued at market could significantly distort the\noperating performance percentage because of wide year-to-year\nmarket value changes in the net worth figure that serves as the\ndenominator. For example, a large decline in securities values\ncould result in a very low market value net worth that, in\nturn, could cause mediocre operating earnings to look\nunrealistically good. Alternatively, the more successful that\nequity investments have been, the larger the net worth base\nbecomes and the poorer the operating performance figure appears.\nTherefore, we will continue to report operating performance\nmeasured against beginning net worth, with securities valued at\ncost.\n\nOn this basis, we had a reasonably good operating\nperformance in 1979 - but not quite as good as that of 1978 -\nwith operating earnings amounting to 18.6% of beginning net\nworth. Earnings per share, of course, increased somewhat (about\n20%) but we regard this as an improper figure upon which to\nfocus. We had substantially more capital to work with in 1979\nthan in 1978, and our performance in utilizing that capital fell\nshort of the earlier year, even though per-share earnings rose.\nEarnings per share will rise constantly on a dormant savings\naccount or on a U. S. Savings Bond bearing a fixed rate of return\nsimply because earnings (the stated interest rate) are\ncontinuously plowed back and added to the capital base. Thus,\neven a stopped clock can look like a growth stock if the\ndividend payout ratio is low.\n\nThe primary test of managerial economic performance is the\nachievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed\n(without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.) and not the\nachievement of consistent gains in earnings per share. In our\nview, many businesses would be better understood by their\nshareholder owners, as well as the general public, if managements\nand financial analysts modified the primary emphasis they place\nupon earnings per share, and upon yearly changes in that figure.",

      "start_anchor": "Long Term Results\n\nIn measuring long term economic performance - in contrast to\nyearly performance - we believe it is appropriate to recognize\nfully any realized capital gains or losses as well as\nextraordinary items, and also to utilize financial statements\npresenting equity securities at market value. Such capital gains\nor losses, either realized or unrealized, are fully as important\nto shareholders over a period of years as earnings realized in a\nmore routine manner through operations; it is just that their\nimpact is often extremely capricious in the short run, a\ncharacteristic that makes them inappropriate as an indicator of\nsingle year managerial performance.\n\nThe book value per share of Berkshire Hathaway on September\n30,1964 (the fiscal yearend prior to the time that your present\nmanagement assumed responsibility) was $19.46 per share. At\nyearend 1979, book value with equity holdings carried at market\nvalue was $335.85 per share. The gain in book value comes to\n20.5% compounded annually. This figure, of course, is far higher\nthan any average of our yearly operating earnings calculations,\nand reflects the importance of capital appreciation of insurance\nequity investments in determining the overall results for our\nshareholders. It probably also is fair to say that the quoted\nbook value in 1964 somewhat overstated the intrinsic value of the\nenterprise, since the assets owned at that time on either a going\nconcern basis or a liquidating value basis were not worth 100\ncents on the dollar. (The liabilities were solid, however.)\n\nWe have achieved this result while utilizing a low amount of\nleverage (both financial leverage measured by debt to equity, and\noperating leverage measured by premium volume to capital funds of\nour insurance business), and also without significant issuance or\nrepurchase of shares. Basically, we have worked with the capital\nwith which we started. From our textile base we, or our Blue\nChip and Wesco subsidiaries, have acquired total ownership of\nthirteen businesses through negotiated purchases from private\nowners for cash, and have started six others. (Its worth a\nmention that those who have sold to us have, almost without\nexception, treated us with exceptional honor and fairness, both\nat the time of sale and subsequently.)\n\nBut before we drown in a sea of self-congratulation, a\nfurther - and crucial - observation must be made. A few years\nago, a business whose per-share net worth compounded at 20%\nannually would have guaranteed its owners a highly successful\nreal investment return. Now such an outcome seems less certain.\nFor the inflation rate, coupled with individual tax rates, will\nbe the ultimate determinant as to whether our internal operating\nperformance produces successful investment results - i. e., a\nreasonable gain in purchasing power from funds committed - for\nyou as shareholders.\n\nJust as the original 3% savings bond, a 5% passbook savings\naccount or an 8% U. S. Treasury Note have, in turn, been\ntransformed by inflation into financial instruments that chew up,\nrather than enhance, purchasing power over their investment\nlives, a business earning 20% on capital can produce a negative\nreal return for its owners under inflationary conditions not much\nmore severe than presently prevail.\n\nIf we should continue to achieve a 20% compounded gain - not\nan easy or certain result by any means - and this gain is\ntranslated into a corresponding increase in the market value of\nBerkshire Hathaway stock as it has been over the last fifteen\nyears, your after-tax purchasing power gain is likely to be very\nclose to zero at a 14% inflation rate. Most of the remaining six\npercentage points will go for income tax any time you wish to\nconvert your twenty percentage points of nominal annual gain into\ncash.\n\nThat combination - the inflation rate plus the percentage of\ncapital that must be paid by the owner to transfer into his own\npocket the annual earnings achieved by the business (i. e.,\nordinary income tax on dividends and capital gains tax on\nretained earnings) - can be thought of as an investors misery\nindex. When this index exceeds the rate of return earned on\nequity by the business, the investors purchasing power (real\ncapital) shrinks even though he consumes nothing at all.\nWe have\nno corporate solution to this problem; high inflation rates will\nnot help us earn higher rates of return on equity.\n\nOne friendly but sharp-eyed commentator on Berkshire has\npointed out that our book value at the end of 1964 would have\nbought about one-half ounce of gold and, fifteen years later,\nafter we have plowed back all earnings along with much blood,\nsweat and tears, the book value produced will buy about the same\nhalf ounce. A similar comparison could be drawn with Middle\nEastern oil. The rub has been that government has been\nexceptionally able in printing money and creating promises, but\nis unable to print gold or create oil.\n\nWe intend to continue to do as well as we can in managing\nthe internal affairs of the business. But you should understand\nthat external conditions affecting the stability of currency may\nvery well be the most important factor in determining whether\nthere are any real rewards from your investment in Berkshire\nHathaway.",

Ben Rosner, at Associated\nRetail Stores, continues to pull rabbits out of the hat - big\nrabbits from a small hat. Year after year, he produces very\nlarge earnings relative to capital employed - realized in cash\nand not in increased receivables and inventories as in many other\nretail businesses - in a segment of the market with little growth\nand unexciting demographics. Ben is now 76 and, like our other\nup-and-comers, Gene Abegg, 82, at Illinois National and Louis\nVincenti, 74, at Wesco, regularly achieves more each year.\n\nOur textile business also continues to produce some cash,\nbut at a low rate compared to capital employed. This is not a\nreflection on the managers, but rather on the industry in which\nthey operate. In some businesses - a network TV station, for\nexample - it is virtually impossible to avoid earning\nextraordinary returns on tangible capital employed in the\nbusiness. And assets in such businesses sell at equally\nextraordinary prices, one thousand cents or more on the dollar, a\nvaluation reflecting the splendid, almost unavoidable, economic\nresults obtainable. Despite a fancy price tag, the easy\nbusiness may be the better route to go.\n\nWe can speak from experience, having tried the other route.\nYour Chairman made the decision a few years ago to purchase\nWaumbec Mills in Manchester, New Hampshire, thereby expanding our\ntextile commitment. By any statistical test, the purchase price\nwas an extraordinary bargain; we bought well below the working\ncapital of the business and, in effect, got very substantial\namounts of machinery and real estate for less than nothing. But\nthe purchase was a mistake. While we labored mightily, new\nproblems arose as fast as old problems were tamed.\n\nBoth our operating and investment experience cause us to\nconclude that turnarounds seldom turn, and that the same\nenergies and talent are much better employed in a good business\npurchased at a fair price than in a poor business purchased at a\nbargain price. Although a mistake, the Waumbec acquisition has\nnot been a disaster.

Aided by Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons\nin Claims, this section of the business produced an underwriting\nprofit of $8.4 million on about $82 million of earned premiums.\nOnly a very few companies in the entire industry produced a\nresult comparable to this.\n\nYou will notice that earned premiums in this segment were\ndown somewhat from those of 1978. We hear a great many insurance\nmanagers talk about being willing to reduce volume in order to\nunderwrite profitably, but we find that very few actually do so.\nPhil Liesche is an exception: if business makes sense, he writes\nit; if it doesnt, he rejects it. It is our policy not to lay\noff people because of the large fluctuations in work load\nproduced by such voluntary volume changes. We would rather have\nsome slack in the organization from time to time than keep\neveryone terribly busy writing business on which we are going to\nlose money. Jack Ringwalt, the founder of National Indemnity\nCompany, instilled this underwriting discipline at the inception\nof the company, and Phil Liesche never has wavered in maintaining\nit. We believe such strong-mindedness is as rare as it is sound\n- and absolutely essential to the running of a first-class\ncasualty insurance operation.\n\nJohn Seward continues to make solid progress at Home and\nAutomobile Insurance Company, in large part by significantly\nexpanding the marketing scope of that company in general\nliability lines. These lines can be dynamite, but the record to\ndate is excellent and, in John Mc Gowan and Paul Springman, we\nhave two cautious liability managers extending our capabilities.\n\nOur reinsurance division, led by George Young, continues to\ngive us reasonably satisfactory overall results after allowing\nfor investment income, but underwriting performance remains\nunsatisfactory. We think the reinsurance business is a very\ntough business that is likely to get much tougher. In fact, the\ninflux of capital into the business and the resulting softer\nprice levels for continually increasing exposures may well\nproduce disastrous results for many entrants (of which they may\nbe blissfully unaware until they are in over their heads; much\nreinsurance business involves an exceptionally long tail, a\ncharacteristic that allows catastrophic current loss experience\nto fester undetected for many years). It will be hard for us to\nbe a whole lot smarter than the crowd and thus our reinsurance\nactivity may decline substantially during the projected prolonged\nperiod of extraordinary competition.\n\nThe Homestate operation was disappointing in 1979.\nExcellent results again were turned in by George Billings at\nTexas United Insurance Company, winner of the annual award for\nthe low loss ratio among Homestate companies, and Floyd Taylor at\nKansas Fire and Casualty Company. But several of the other\noperations, particularly Cornhusker Casualty Company, our first\nand largest Homestate operation and historically a winner, had\npoor underwriting results which were accentuated by data\nprocessing, administrative and personnel problems. We have made\nsome major mistakes in reorganizing our data processing\nactivities, and those mistakes will not be cured immediately or\nwithout cost. However, John Ringwalt has thrown himself into the\ntask of getting things straightened out and we have confidence\nthat he, aided by several strong people who recently have been\nbrought aboard, will succeed.\n\nOur performance in Workers Compensation was far, far better\nthan we had any right to expect at the beginning of 1979. We had\na very favorable climate in California for the achievement of\ngood results but, beyond this, Milt Thornton at Cypress Insurance\nCompany and Frank De Nardo at National Indemnitys California\nWorkers Compensation operation both performed in a simply\noutstanding manner. We have admitted - and with good reason -\nsome mistakes on the acquisition front, but the Cypress purchase\nhas turned out to be an absolute gem. Milt Thornton, like Phil\nLiesche, follows the policy of sticking with business that he\nunderstands and wants, without giving consideration to the impact\non volume. As a result, he has an outstanding book of business\nand an exceptionally well functioning group of employees. Frank\nDe Nardo has straightened out the mess he inherited in Los Angeles\nin a manner far beyond our expectations, producing savings\nmeasured in seven figures. He now can begin to build on a sound\nbase.\n\nAt yearend we entered the specialized area of surety\nreinsurance under the management of Chet Noble. At least\ninitially, this operation will be relatively small since our\npolicy will be to seek client companies who appreciate the need\nfor a long term partnership relationship with their reinsurers.\nWe are pleased by the quality of the insurers we have attracted,\nand hope to add several more of the best primary writers as our\nfinancial strength and stability become better known in the\nsurety field.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that insurance underwriting\noverall will be poor in 1980, but that rates will start to firm\nin a year or so, leading to a turn in the cycle some time in\n1981. We disagree with this view. Present interest rates\nencourage the obtaining of business at underwriting loss levels\nformerly regarded as totally unacceptable. Managers decry the\nfolly of underwriting at a loss to obtain investment income, but\nwe believe that many will. Thus we expect that competition will\ncreate a new threshold of tolerance for underwriting losses, and\nthat combined ratios will average higher in the future than in\nthe past.\n\nTo some extent, the day of reckoning has been postponed\nbecause of marked reduction in the frequency of auto accidents -\nprobably brought on in major part by changes in driving habits\ninduced by higher gas prices. In our opinion, if the habits\nhadnt changed, auto insurance rates would have been very little\nhigher and underwriting results would have been much worse. This\ndosage of serendipity wont last indefinitely.\n\nOur forecast is for an average combined ratio for the\nindustry in the 105 area over the next five years. While we have\na high degree of confidence that certain of our operations will\ndo considerably better than average, it will be a challenge to us\nto operate below the industry figure.

In 1979 they continued\nto perform well, largely because the underlying companies in\nwhich we have invested, in practically all cases, turned in\noutstanding performances. Retained earnings applicable to our\ninsurance equity investments, not reported in our financial\nstatements, continue to mount annually and, in aggregate, now\ncome to a very substantial number. We have faith that the\nmanagements of these companies will utilize those retained\nearnings effectively and will translate a dollar retained by them\ninto a dollar or more of subsequent market value for us.

We very much\nlike the companies in which we have major investments, and plan\nno changes to try to attune ourselves to the markets of a\nspecific year.\n\nSince we have covered our philosophy regarding equities\nextensively in recent annual reports, a more extended discussion\nof bond investments may be appropriate for this one, particularly\nin light of what has happened since yearend. An extraordinary\namount of money has been lost by the insurance industry in the\nbond area - notwithstanding the accounting convention that allows\ninsurance companies to carry their bond investments at amortized\ncost, regardless of impaired market value. Actually, that very\naccounting convention may have contributed in a major way to the\nlosses; had management been forced to recognize market values,\nits attention might have been focused much earlier on the dangers\nof a very long-term bond contract.\n\nIronically, many insurance companies have decided that a\none-year auto policy is inappropriate during a time of inflation,\nand six-month policies have been brought in as replacements.\nHow, say many of the insurance managers, can we be expected to\nlook forward twelve months and estimate such imponderables as\nhospital costs, auto parts prices, etc.? But, having decided\nthat one year is too long a period for which to set a fixed price\nfor insurance in an inflationary world, they then have turned\naround, taken the proceeds from the sale of that six-month\npolicy, and sold the money at a fixed price for thirty or forty\nyears.",

      "start_anchor": "The very long-term bond contract has been the last major\nfixed price contract of extended duration still regularly\ninitiated in an inflation-ridden world. The buyer of money to be\nused between 1980 and 2020 has been able to obtain a firm price\nnow for each year of its use while the buyer of auto insurance,\nmedical services, newsprint, office space - or just about any\nother product or service - would be greeted with laughter if he\nwere to request a firm price now to apply through 1985. For in\nvirtually all other areas of commerce, parties to long-term\ncontracts now either index prices in some manner, or insist on\nthe right to review the situation every year or so.\n\nA cultural lag has prevailed in the bond area. The buyers\n(borrowers) and middlemen (underwriters) of money hardly could be\nexpected to raise the question of whether it all made sense, and\nthe sellers (lenders) slept through an economic and contractual\nrevolution.\n\nFor the last few years our insurance companies have not been\na net purchaser of any straight long-term bonds (those without\nconversion rights or other attributes offering profit\npossibilities). There have been some purchases in the straight\nbond area, of course, but they have been offset by sales or\nmaturities. Even prior to this period, we never would buy thirty\nor forty-year bonds; instead we tried to concentrate in the\nstraight bond area on shorter issues with sinking funds and on\nissues that seemed relatively undervalued because of bond market\ninefficiencies.\n\nHowever, the mild degree of caution that we exercised was an\nimproper response to the world unfolding about us. You do not\nadequately protect yourself by being half awake while others are\nsleeping. It was a mistake to buy fifteen-year bonds, and yet we\ndid; we made an even more serious mistake in not selling them (at\nlosses, if necessary) when our present views began to\ncrystallize. (Naturally, those views are much clearer and\ndefinite in retrospect; it would be fair for you to ask why we\nwerent writing about this subject last year.)\n\nOf course, we must hold significant amounts of bonds or\nother fixed dollar obligations in conjunction with our insurance\noperations. In the last several years our net fixed dollar\ncommitments have been limited to the purchase of convertible\nbonds. We believe that the conversion options obtained, in\neffect, give that portion of the bond portfolio a far shorter\naverage life than implied by the maturity terms of the issues\n(i.e., at an appropriate time of our choosing, we can terminate\nthe bond contract by conversion into stock).\n\nThis bond policy has given us significantly lower unrealized\nlosses than those experienced by the great majority of property\nand casualty insurance companies. We also have been helped by\nour strong preference for equities in recent years that has kept\nour overall bond segment relatively low. Nevertheless, we are\ntaking our lumps in bonds and feel that, in a sense, our mistakes\nshould be viewed less charitably than the mistakes of those who\nwent about their business unmindful of the developing problems.\n\nHarking back to our textile experience, we should have\nrealized the futility of trying to be very clever (via sinking\nfunds and other special type issues) in an area where the tide\nwas running heavily against us.\n\nWe have severe doubts as to whether a very long-term fixedinterest bond, denominated in dollars, remains an appropriate\nbusiness contract in a world where the value of dollars seems\nalmost certain to shrink by the day. Those dollars, as well as\npaper creations of other governments, simply may have too many\nstructural weaknesses to appropriately serve as a unit of long\nterm commercial reference. If so, really long bonds may turn out\nto be obsolete instruments and insurers who have bought those\nmaturities of 2010 or 2020 could have major and continuing\nproblems on their hands. We, likewise, will be unhappy with our\nfifteen-year bonds and will annually pay a price in terms of\nearning power that reflects that mistake.\n\nSome of our convertible bonds appear exceptionally\nattractive to us, and have the same sort of earnings retention\nfactor (applicable to the stock into which they may be converted)\nthat prevails in our conventional equity portfolio. We expect to\nmake money in these bonds (we already have, in a few cases) and\nhave hopes that our profits in this area may offset losses in\nstraight bonds.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the possibility that our present\nanalysis is much too negative. The chances for very low rates of\ninflation are not nil. Inflation is man-made; perhaps it can be\nman-mastered. The threat which alarms us may also alarm\nlegislators and other powerful groups, prompting some appropriate\nresponse.\n\nFurthermore, present interest rates incorporate much higher\ninflation projections than those of a year or two ago. Such\nrates may prove adequate or more than adequate to protect bond\nbuyers. We even may miss large profits from a major rebound in\nbond prices. However, our unwillingness to fix a price now for a\npound of Sees candy or a yard of Berkshire cloth to be delivered\nin 2010 or 2020 makes us equally unwilling to buy bonds which set\na price on money now for use in those years.

Prior to such listing, the Wall Street\njournal and the Dow-Jones news ticker would not report our\nearnings, even though such earnings were one hundred or more\ntimes the level of some companies whose reports they regularly\npicked up.\n\nNow, however, the Dow-Jones news ticker reports our\nquarterly earnings promptly after we release them and, in\naddition, both the ticker and the Wall Street journal report our\nannual earnings. This solves a dissemination problem that had\nbothered us.\n\nIn some ways, our shareholder group is a rather unusual one,\nand this affects our manner of reporting to you. For example, at\nthe end of each year about 98% of the shares outstanding are held\nby people who also were shareholders at the beginning of the\nyear. Therefore, in our annual report we build upon what we have\ntold you in previous years instead of restating a lot of\nmaterial. You get more useful information this way, and we dont\nget bored.\n\nFurthermore, perhaps 90% of our shares are owned by\ninvestors for whom Berkshire is their largest security holding,\nvery often far and away the largest. Many of these owners are\nwilling to spend a significant amount of time with the annual\nreport, and we attempt to provide them with the same information\nwe would find useful if the roles were reversed.\n\nIn contrast, we include no narrative with our quarterly\nreports. Our owners and managers both have very long timehorizons in regard to this business, and it is difficult to say\nanything new or meaningful each quarter about events of long-term\nsignificance.\n\nBut when you do receive a communication from us, it will\ncome from the fellow you are paying to run the business. Your\nChairman has a firm belief that owners are entitled to hear\ndirectly from the CEO as to what is going on and how he evaluates\nthe business, currently and prospectively. You would demand that\nin a private company; you should expect no less in a public\ncompany. A once-a-year report of stewardship should not be\nturned over to a staff specialist or public relations consultant\nwho is unlikely to be in a position to talk frankly on a managerto-owner basis.\n\nWe feel that you, as owners, are entitled to the same sort\nof reporting by your manager as we feel is owed to us at\nBerkshire Hathaway by managers of our business units. Obviously,\nthe degree of detail must be different, particularly where\ninformation would be useful to a business competitor or the like.\nBut the general scope, balance, and level of candor should be\nsimilar. We dont expect a public relations document when our\noperating managers tell us what is going on, and we dont feel\nyou should receive such a document.\n\nIn large part, companies obtain the shareholder constituency\nthat they seek and deserve. If they focus their thinking and\ncommunications on short-term results or short-term stock market\nconsequences they will, in large part, attract shareholders who\nfocus on the same factors. And if they are cynical in their\ntreatment of investors, eventually that cynicism is highly likely\nto be returned by the investment community.\n\nPhil Fisher, a respected investor and author, once likened\nthe policies of the corporation in attracting shareholders to\nthose of a restaurant attracting potential customers. A\nrestaurant could seek a given clientele - patrons of fast foods,\nelegant dining, Oriental food, etc. - and eventually obtain an\nappropriate group of devotees. If the job were expertly done,\nthat clientele, pleased with the service, menu, and price level\noffered, would return consistently. But the restaurant could not\nchange its character constantly and end up with a revolving\ndoor of confused and dissatisfied customers.\n\nSo it is with corporations and the shareholder constituency\nthey seek. You cant be all things to all men, simultaneously\nseeking different owners whose primary interests run from high\ncurrent yield to long-term capital growth to stock market\npyrotechnics, etc.\n\nThe reasoning of managements that seek large trading\nactivity in their shares puzzles us. In effect, such managements\nare saying that they want a good many of the existing clientele\ncontinually to desert them in favor of new ones - because you\ncant add lots of new owners (with new expectations) without\nlosing lots of former owners.\n\nWe much prefer owners who like our service and menu and who\nreturn year after year. It would be hard to find a better group\nto sit in the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder seats than those\nalready occupying them. So we hope to continue to have a very\nlow turnover among our owners, reflecting a constituency that\nunderstands our operation, approves of our policies, and shares\nour expectations. And we hope to deliver on those expectations.",

Our forecast for 1980 is the same. If we are\nwrong, it will be on the downside. In other words, we are\nvirtually certain that our operating earnings expressed as a\npercentage of the new equity base of approximately $236 million,\nvaluing securities at cost, will decline from the 18.6% attained\nin 1979. There is also a fair chance that operating earnings in\naggregate dollars will fall short of 1979; the outcome depends\npartly upon the date of disposition of the bank, partly upon the\ndegree of slippage in insurance underwriting profitability, and\npartly upon the severity of earnings problems in the savings and\nloan industry.\n\nWe continue to feel very good about our insurance equity\ninvestments. Over a period of years, we expect to develop very\nlarge and growing amounts of underlying earning power\nattributable to our fractional ownership of these companies. In\nmost cases they are splendid businesses, splendidly managed,\npurchased at highly attractive prices.\n\nYour company is run on the principle of centralization of\nfinancial decisions at the top (the very top, it might be added),\nand rather extreme delegation of operating authority to a number\nof key managers at the individual company or business unit level.\nWe could just field a basketball team with our corporate\nheadquarters group (which utilizes only about 1500 square feet of\nspace).\n\nThis approach produces an occasional major mistake that\nmight have been eliminated or minimized through closer operating\ncontrols. But it also eliminates large layers of costs and\ndramatically speeds decision-making. Because everyone has a\ngreat deal to do, a very great deal gets done. Most important of\nall, it enables us to attract and retain some extraordinarily\ntalented individuals - people who simply cant be hired in the\nnormal course of events - who find working for Berkshire to be\nalmost identical to running their own show.\n\nWe have placed much trust in them - and their achievements\nhave far exceeded that trust.\n\nWarren E. Buffett, Chairman\nMarch 3,1980",
