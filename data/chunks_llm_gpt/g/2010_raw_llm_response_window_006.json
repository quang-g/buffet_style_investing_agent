      "start_anchor": "Memo\nTo: Berkshire Hathaway Managers (“The All-Stars”)\ncc: Berkshire Directors\nFrom: Warren E. Buffett\nDate: July 26,2010\nThis is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire’s top priority and to get your help on\nsuccession planning (yours, not mine!).\nThe priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t be\nperfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to lose\nmoney – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.” We\nmust continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have\nwritten about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent\nreporter.\nSometimes your associates will say “Everybody else is doing it.” This rationale is almost always\na bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a\nmoral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they\ncan’t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter\nor a judge and see how far it gets them.\nIf you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call.\nHowever, it’s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it’s too close to the line\nand should be abandoned. There’s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it’s\nquestionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.\nAs a corollary, let me know promptly if there’s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news\nbut I don’t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad\nnews is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that\nalmost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees.\n\nSomebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we\nknew of it. That’s inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that number\ngetting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in\nminimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of\nimpropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most\nimportant factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines\nhow an organization behaves.\nIn other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you\ndoes a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don’t need me to\nhelp. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits and any\nunusually large capital expenditures or acquisitions.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retire\nand I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.) But just in case you don’t, please send me a letter\n(at home if you wish) giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should\nbecome incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I’m no longer CEO, in\nwhich case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of\nyour primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you have\nparticipated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it’s\nimportant to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have\nyour thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a few\noperations that are run by two or more of you – such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at Applied\nUnderwriters, etc. – and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal,\nhandwritten, etc. Just mark it “Personal for Warren.”\nThanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make\nmy job easy.\nWEB/db\nP. S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercede\nwith the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will be\naccompanied by “It can’t hurt to ask.” It will be easier for both of us if you just say “no.” As an added\nfavor, don’t suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 76 businesses by the periodic “I think he’ll\nbe interested in this one” and you can understand why it is better to say no firmly and immediately.",
