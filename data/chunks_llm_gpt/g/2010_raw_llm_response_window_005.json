Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaningless at Berkshire.\nRegardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could – quite legally – cause net income in any\ngiven period to be almost any number we would like.",

      "start_anchor": "The Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30 th. Carrie Kizer from our home office will be the\nringmaster, and her theme this year is Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This gives Net Jets, BNSF and BYD a\nchance to show off.\nAs always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a. m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8: 30. At 9: 30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s\nstands) will last until 3: 30. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3: 45. If you decide\nto leave during the day’s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.)\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-squarefoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did\nyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,053 pairs of Justin boots,\n12,416 pounds of See’s candy, 8,000 Dairy Queen Blizzards® and 8,800 Quikut knives (that’s 16 knives per\nminute). But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can’t buy happiness simply hasn’t learned\nwhere to shop.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we\noperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For\nat least half of you, I believe we can.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 60 books and DVDs, including the Chinese\nlanguage edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can’t read\nChinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite. Should you need to ship\nyour book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\nIf you are a big spender – or merely a gawker – visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha\nairport between noon and 5: 00 p. m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of Net Jets aircraft that will get your\npulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet.",
