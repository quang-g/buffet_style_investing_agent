      "start_anchor": "After they occur, our earning power will be significantly\nreduced. That’s the bad news.\nThere are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least\n$500 million – and perhaps much more – to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yields\nis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of\n“normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an\nopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To update\nAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\nIn addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen\ndividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though\nconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength\nand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don’t fault the Fed: For\nvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just\nthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In\n2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I\nwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share of\nCoke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\nOverall, I believe our “normal” investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.",

Todd, as was the case with\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by\nundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have\nreceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their\nlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly started\nanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past\nlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\nAs long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire’s holdings, both bonds\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can reset\nannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like to\nrequire style boxes such as “long-short,” “macro,” “international equities.” At Berkshire our only style box is\n“smart.”)\nOver time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager’s performance compensation be dependent on his or her own\nportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big for\nindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\nWhen Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a useful\nperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted – but not to have a vote – on the\nwisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\nOne footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a number of commentators\npointed out that he was “little-known” and expressed puzzlement that we didn’t seek a “big-name.” I wonder\nhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959.

Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and the\nunwinding or expiration of some contracts.\nOur continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories.\nWe view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assuming\nrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions are\nidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front when\nwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That’s important.\nOur first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minor\nexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.\nIn aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an “underwriting\nprofit,” meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received.

      "start_anchor": "As a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originally\nreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.\nConsequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that\n$647 million for about three years.\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.\nThe future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31,2010 –\nand foreign exchange rates are unchanged – we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to\n2026. You can call this amount “settlement value.”\nOn our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will record\na $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion and\nthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability will\nfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that,\nof course, is far from a sure thing.\nWhat is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining “float” of $4.2 billion for an average of about\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance float\nfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase\nof BNSF.\nAs I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\ncollateral – a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feeling\ncomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.\nForegoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it.",
