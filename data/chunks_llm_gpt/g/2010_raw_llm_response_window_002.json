      "start_anchor": "Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll present them\nas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\nWe will look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our\nexpansion over the years.\nInsurance\nProperty-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to\nothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims\ncome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at the\nfollowing table:\nFloat\nYearend (in $ millions)\n1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 39\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 237\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,632\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,871\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65,832\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free\nmoney – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a\nsignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State\nFarm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss in\nseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.\nAt Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite\nprofitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better than\ncost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holding\nits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.",

The urgings of Wall Street, pressures from\nthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes has\nled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. “The other guy is doing it so we must as well” spells\ntrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results.
