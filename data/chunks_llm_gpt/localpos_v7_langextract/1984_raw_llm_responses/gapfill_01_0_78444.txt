    "chunk_text": "Our gain in net worth during 1984 was $152.6 million, or\n$133 per share. This sounds pretty good but actually its\nmediocre. Economic gains must be evaluated by comparison with\nthe capital that produces them. Our twenty-year compounded\nannual gain in book value has been 22.1% (from $19.46 in 1964 to\n$1108.77 in 1984), but our gain in 1984 was only 13.6%.\n\nAs we discussed last year, the gain in per-share intrinsic\nbusiness value is the economic measurement that really counts.\nBut calculations of intrinsic business value are subjective. In\nour case, book value serves as a useful, although somewhat\nunderstated, proxy. In my judgment, intrinsic business value and\nbook value increased during 1984 at about the same rate.\n\nUsing my academic voice, I have told you in the past of the\ndrag that a mushrooming capital base exerts upon rates of return.\nUnfortunately, my academic voice is now giving way to a\nreportorial voice. Our historical 22% rate is just that -\nhistory. To earn even 15% annually over the next decade\n(assuming we continue to follow our present dividend policy,\nabout which more will be said later in this letter) we would need\nprofits aggregating about $3.9 billion. Accomplishing this will\nrequire a few big ideas - small ones just wont do. Charlie\nMunger, my partner in general management, and I do not have any\nsuch ideas at present, but our experience has been that they pop\nup occasionally. (Hows that for a strategic plan?)",

    "chunk_text": "Sharp-eyed shareholders will notice that the amount of the\nspecial GEICO distribution and its location in the table have\nbeen changed from the presentation of last year. Though they\nreclassify and reduce accounting earnings, the changes are\nentirely of form, not of substance. The story behind the\nchanges, however, is interesting.\n\nAs reported last year: (1) in mid-1983 GEICO made a tender\noffer to buy its own shares; (2) at the same time, we agreed by\nwritten contract to sell GEICO an amount of its shares that would\nbe proportionately related to the aggregate number of shares\nGEICO repurchased via the tender from all other shareholders; (3)\nat completion of the tender, we delivered 350,000 shares to\nGEICO, received $21 million cash, and were left owning exactly\nthe same percentage of GEICO that we owned before the tender; (4)\nGEICOs transaction with us amounted to a proportionate\nredemption, an opinion rendered us, without qualification, by a\nleading law firm; (5) the Tax Code logically regards such\nproportionate redemptions as substantially equivalent to\ndividends and, therefore, the $21 million we received was taxed\nat only the 6.9% inter-corporate dividend rate; (6) importantly,\nthat $21 million was far less than the previously-undistributed\nearnings that had inured to our ownership in GEICO and, thus,\nfrom the standpoint of economic substance, was in our view\nequivalent to a dividend.\n\nBecause it was material and unusual, we highlighted the\nGEICO distribution last year to you, both in the applicable\nquarterly report and in this section of the annual report.\nAdditionally, we emphasized the transaction to our auditors,\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. Both the Omaha office of Peat\nMarwick and the reviewing Chicago partner, without objection,\nconcurred with our dividend presentation.\n\nIn 1984, we had a virtually identical transaction with\nGeneral Foods. The only difference was that General Foods\nrepurchased its stock over a period of time in the open market,\nwhereas GEICO had made a one-shot tender offer. In the General\nFoods case we sold to the company, on each day that it\nrepurchased shares, a quantity of shares that left our ownership\npercentage precisely unchanged. Again our transaction was\npursuant to a written contract executed before repurchases began.\nAnd again the money we received was far less than the retained\nearnings that had inured to our ownership interest since our\npurchase. Overall we received $21,843,601 in cash from General\nFoods, and our ownership remained at exactly 8.75%.\n\nAt this point the New York office of Peat Marwick came into\nthe picture. Late in 1984 it indicated that it disagreed with\nthe conclusions of the firms Omaha office and Chicago reviewing\npartner. The New York view was that the GEICO and General Foods\ntransactions should be treated as sales of stock by Berkshire\nrather than as the receipt of dividends. Under this accounting\napproach, a portion of the cost of our investment in the stock of\neach company would be charged against the redemption payment and\nany gain would be shown as a capital gain, not as dividend\nincome. This is an accounting approach only, having no bearing\non taxes: Peat Marwick agrees that the transactions were\ndividends for IRS purposes.\n\nWe disagree with the New York position from both the\nviewpoint of economic substance and proper accounting. But, to\navoid a qualified auditors opinion, we have adopted herein Peat\nMarwicks 1984 view and restated 1983 accordingly. None of this,\nhowever, has any effect on intrinsic business value: our\nownership interests in GEICO and General Foods, our cash, our\ntaxes, and the market value and tax basis of our holdings all\nremain the same.\n\nThis year we have again entered into a contract with General\nFoods whereby we will sell them shares concurrently with open\nmarket purchases that they make. The arrangement provides that\nour ownership interest will remain unchanged at all times. By\nkeeping it so, we will insure ourselves dividend treatment for\ntax purposes. In our view also, the economic substance of this\ntransaction again is the creation of dividend income. However,\nwe will account for the redemptions as sales of stock rather than\ndividend income unless accounting rules are adopted that speak\ndirectly to this point. We will continue to prominently identify\nany such special transactions in our reports to you.",

    "chunk_text": "While we enjoy a low tax charge on these proportionate\nredemptions, and have participated in several of them, we view\nsuch repurchases as at least equally favorable for shareholders\nwho do not sell. When companies with outstanding businesses and\ncomfortable financial positions find their shares selling far\nbelow intrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action\ncan benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases.\n\n(Our endorsement of repurchases is limited to those dictated\nby price/value relationships and does not extend to the\ngreenmail repurchase - a practice we find odious and repugnant.\nIn these transactions, two parties achieve their personal ends by\nexploitation of an innocent and unconsulted third party. The\nplayers are: (1) the shareholder extortionist who, even before\nthe ink on his stock certificate dries, delivers his yourmoney-or-your-life message to managers; (2) the corporate\ninsiders who quickly seek peace at any price - as long as the\nprice is paid by someone else; and (3) the shareholders whose\nmoney is used by (2) to make (1) go away. As the dust settles,\nthe mugging, transient shareholder gives his speech on free\nenterprise, the muggee management gives its speech on the best\ninterests of the company, and the innocent shareholder standing\nby mutely funds the payoff.)\n\nThe companies in which we have our largest investments have\nall engaged in significant stock repurhases at times when wide\ndiscrepancies existed between price and value. As shareholders,\nwe find this encouraging and rewarding for two important reasons\n- one that is obvious, and one that is subtle and not always\nunderstood. The obvious point involves basic arithmetic: major\nrepurchases at prices well below per-share intrinsic business\nvalue immediately increase, in a highly significant way, that\nvalue. When companies purchase their own stock, they often find\nit easy to get $2 of present value for $1. Corporate acquisition\nprograms almost never do as well and, in a discouragingly large\nnumber of cases, fail to get anything close to $1 of value for\neach $1 expended.\n\nThe other benefit of repurchases is less subject to precise\nmeasurement but can be fully as important over time. By making\nrepurchases when a companys market value is well below its\nbusiness value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given\nto actions that enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than\nto actions that expand managements domain but that do nothing\nfor (or even harm) shareholders. Seeing this, shareholders and\npotential shareholders increase their estimates of future returns\nfrom the business. This upward revision, in turn, produces\nmarket prices more in line with intrinsic business value. These\nprices are entirely rational. Investors should pay more for a\nbusiness that is lodged in the hands of a manager with\ndemonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands\nof a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer. (To\nmake the point extreme, how much would you pay to be a minority\nshareholder of a company controlled by Robert Wesco?)\n\nThe key word is demonstrated. A manager who consistently\nturns his back on repurchases, when these clearly are in the\ninterests of owners, reveals more than he knows of his\nmotivations. No matter how often or how eloquently he mouths\nsome public relations-inspired phrase such as maximizing\nshareholder wealth (this seasons favorite), the market\ncorrectly discounts assets lodged with him. His heart is not\nlistening to his mouth - and, after a while, neither will the\nmarket.\n\nWe have prospered in a very major way - as have other\nshareholders - by the large share repurchases of GEICO,\nWashington Post, and General Foods, our three largest holdings.\n(Exxon, in which we have our fourth largest holding, has also\nwisely and aggressively repurchased shares but, in this case, we\nhave only recently established our position.) In each of these\ncompanies, shareholders have had their interests in outstanding\nbusinesses materially enhanced by repurchases made at bargain\nprices. We feel very comfortable owning interests in businesses\nsuch as these that offer excellent economics combined with\nshareholder-conscious managements.",

    "chunk_text": "Nebraska Furniture Mart\n\nLast year I introduced you to Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin) and her\nfamily. I told you they were terrific, and I understated the\ncase. After another year of observing their remarkable talents\nand character, I can honestly say that I never have seen a\nmanagerial group that either functions or behaves better than the\nBlumkin family.\n\nMrs. B, Chairman of the Board, is now 91, and recently was\nquoted in the local newspaper as saying, I come home to eat and\nsleep, and thats about it. I cant wait until it gets daylight\nso I can get back to the business. Mrs. B is at the store seven\ndays a week, from opening to close, and probably makes more\ndecisions in a day than most CEOs do in a year (better ones,\ntoo).\n\nIn May Mrs. B was granted an Honorary Doctorate in\nCommercial Science by New York University. (Shes a fast track\nstudent: not one day in her life was spent in a school room prior\nto her receipt of the doctorate.) Previous recipients of honorary\ndegrees in business from NYU include Clifton Garvin, Jr., CEO of\nExxon Corp.; Walter Wriston, then CEO of Citicorp; Frank Cary,\nthen CEO of IBM; Tom Murphy, then CEO of General Motors; and,\nmost recently, Paul Volcker. (They are in good company.)\n\nThe Blumkin blood did not run thin. Louie, Mrs. Bs son,\nand his three boys, Ron, Irv, and Steve, all contribute in full\nmeasure to NFMs amazing success. The younger generation has\nattended the best business school of them all - that conducted by\nMrs. B and Louie - and their training is evident in their\nperformance.\n\nLast year NFMs net sales increased by $14.3 million,\nbringing the total to $115 million, all from the one store in\nOmaha. That is by far the largest volume produced by a single\nhome furnishings store in the United States. In fact, the gain\nin sales last year was itself greater than the annual volume of\nmany good-sized successful stores. The business achieves this\nsuccess because it deserves this success. A few figures will\ntell you why.\n\nIn its fiscal 1984 10-K, the largest independent specialty\nretailer of home furnishings in the country, Levitz Furniture,\ndescribed its prices as generally lower than the prices charged\nby conventional furniture stores in its trading area. Levitz,\nin that year, operated at a gross margin of 44.4% (that is, on\naverage, customers paid it $100 for merchandise that had cost it\n$55.60 to buy). The gross margin at NFM is not much more than\nhalf of that. NFMs low mark-ups are possible because of its\nexceptional efficiency: operating expenses (payroll, occupancy,\nadvertising, etc.) are about 16.5% of sales versus 35.6% at\nLevitz.\n\nNone of this is in criticism of Levitz, which has a wellmanaged operation. But the NFM operation is simply extraordinary\n(and, remember, it all comes from a $500 investment by Mrs. B in\n1937). By unparalleled efficiency and astute volume purchasing,\nNFM is able to earn excellent returns on capital while saving its\ncustomers at least $30 million annually from what, on average, it\nwould cost them to buy the same merchandise at stores maintaining\ntypical mark-ups. Such savings enable NFM to constantly widen\nits geographical reach and thus to enjoy growth well beyond the\nnatural growth of the Omaha market.\n\nI have been asked by a number of people just what secrets\nthe Blumkins bring to their business. These are not very\nesoteric. All members of the family: (1) apply themselves with\nan enthusiasm and energy that would make Ben Franklin and Horatio\nAlger look like dropouts; (2) define with extraordinary realism\ntheir area of special competence and act decisively on all\nmatters within it; (3) ignore even the most enticing propositions\nfailing outside of that area of special competence; and, (4)\nunfailingly behave in a high-grade manner with everyone they deal\nwith. (Mrs. B boils it down to sell cheap and tell the truth.)\n\nOur evaluation of the integrity of Mrs. B and her family was\ndemonstrated when we purchased 90% of the business: NFM had never\nhad an audit and we did not request one; we did not take an\ninventory nor verify the receivables; we did not check property\ntitles. We gave Mrs. B a check for $55 million and she gave us\nher word. That made for an even exchange.\n\nYou and I are fortunate to be in partnership with the\nBlumkin family.",

To the contrary, many well-known participants in the\nboxed-chocolate industry either have lost money in this same\nperiod or have been marginally profitable. To our knowledge,\nonly one good-sized competitor has achieved high profitability.\nThe success of Sees reflects the combination of an exceptional\nproduct and an exceptional manager, Chuck Huggins.\n\nDuring 1984 we increased prices considerably less than has\nbeen our practice in recent years: per-pound realization was\n$5.49, up only 1.4% from 1983. Fortunately, we made good\nprogress on cost control, an area that has caused us problems in\nrecent years. Per-pound costs - other than those for raw\nmaterials, a segment of expense largely outside of our control -\nincreased by only 2.2% last year.\n\nOur cost-control problem has been exacerbated by the problem\nof modestly declining volume (measured by pounds, not dollars) on\na same-store basis. Total pounds sold through shops in recent\nyears has been maintained at a roughly constant level only by the\nnet addition of a few shops annually. This more-shops-to-getthe-same-volume situation naturally puts heavy pressure on perpound selling costs.\n\nIn 1984, same-store volume declined 1.1%. Total shop volume,\nhowever, grew 0.6% because of an increase in stores. (Both\npercentages are adjusted to compensate for a 53-week fiscal year\nin 1983.)\n\nSees business tends to get a bit more seasonal each year.\nIn the four weeks prior to Christmas, we do 40% of the years\nvolume and earn about 75% of the years profits. We also earn\nsignificant sums in the Easter and Valentines Day periods, but\npretty much tread water the rest of the year. In recent years,\nshop volume at Christmas has grown in relative importance, and so\nhave quantity orders and mail orders. The increased\nconcentration of business in the Christmas period produces a\nmultitude of managerial problems, all of which have been handled\nby Chuck and his associates with exceptional skill and grace.\n\nTheir solutions have in no way involved compromises in\neither quality of service or quality of product. Most of our\nlarger competitors could not say the same. Though faced with\nsomewhat less extreme peaks and valleys in demand than we, they\nadd preservatives or freeze the finished product in order to\nsmooth the production cycle and thereby lower unit costs. We\nreject such techniques, opting, in effect, for production\nheadaches rather than product modification.\n\nOur mall stores face a host of new food and snack vendors\nthat provide particularly strong competition at non-holiday\nperiods. We need new products to fight back and during 1984 we\nintroduced six candy bars that, overall, met with a good\nreception. Further product introductions are planned.\n\nIn 1985 we will intensify our efforts to keep per-pound cost\nincreases below the rate of inflation. Continued success in\nthese efforts, however, will require gains in same-store\npoundage. Prices in 1985 should average 6% - 7% above those of\n1984. Assuming no change in same-store volume, profits should\nshow a moderate gain.",

    "chunk_text": "Buffalo Evening News\n\nProfits at the News in 1984 were considerably greater than\nwe expected. As at Sees, excellent progress was made in\ncontrolling costs. Excluding hours worked in the newsroom, total\nhours worked decreased by about 2.8%. With this productivity\nimprovement, overall costs increased only 4.9%. This performance\nby Stan Lipsey and his management team was one of the best in the\nindustry.\n\nHowever, we now face an acceleration in costs. In mid-1984\nwe entered into new multi-year union contracts that provided for\na large catch-up wage increase. This catch-up is entirely\nappropriate: the cooperative spirit of our unions during the\nunprofitable 1977-1982 period was an important factor in our\nsuccess in remaining cost competitive with The Courier-Express.\nHad we not kept costs down, the outcome of that struggle might\nwell have been different.\n\nBecause our new union contracts took effect at varying\ndates, little of the catch-up increase was reflected in our 1984\ncosts. But the increase will be almost totally effective in 1985\nand, therefore, our unit labor costs will rise this year at a\nrate considerably greater than that of the industry. We expect\nto mitigate this increase by continued small gains in\nproductivity, but we cannot avoid significantly higher wage costs\nthis year. Newsprint price trends also are less favorable now\nthan they were in 1984. Primarily because of these two factors,\nwe expect at least a minor contraction in margins at the News.\n\nWorking in our favor at the News are two factors of major\neconomic importance:\n\n(1) Our circulation is concentrated to an unusual degree\nin the area of maximum utility to our advertisers.\nRegional newspapers with wide-ranging circulation, on\nthe other hand, have a significant portion of their\ncirculation in areas that are of negligible utility to\nmost advertisers. A subscriber several hundred miles\naway is not much of a prospect for the puppy you are\noffering to sell via a classified ad - nor for the\ngrocer with stores only in the metropolitan area.\nWasted circulation - as the advertisers call it -\nhurts profitability: expenses of a newspaper are largely\ndetermined by gross circulation while advertising revenues\n(usually 70% - 80% of total revenues) are responsive only\nto useful circulation;\n\n(2) Our penetration of the Buffalo retail market is\nexceptional; advertisers can reach almost all of their\npotential customers using only the News.\n\nLast year I told you about this unusual reader acceptance:\namong the 100 largest newspapers in the country, we were then\nnumber one, daily, and number three, Sunday, in penetration. The\nmost recent figures show us number one in penetration on weekdays\nand number two on Sunday. (Even so, the number of households in\nBuffalo has declined, so our current weekday circulation is down\nslightly; on Sundays it is unchanged.)\n\nI told you also that one of the major reasons for this\nunusual acceptance by readers was the unusual quantity of news\nthat we delivered to them: a greater percentage of our paper is\ndevoted to news than is the case at any other dominant paper in\nour size range. In 1984 our news hole ratio was 50.9%, (versus\n50.4% in 1983), a level far above the typical 35% - 40%. We will\ncontinue to maintain this ratio in the 50% area. Also, though we\nlast year reduced total hours worked in other departments, we\nmaintained the level of employment in the newsroom and, again,\nwill continue to do so. Newsroom costs advanced 9.1% in 1984, a\nrise far exceeding our overall cost increase of 4.9%.\n\nOur news hole policy costs us significant extra money for\nnewsprint. As a result, our news costs (newsprint for the news\nhole plus payroll and expenses of the newsroom) as a percentage\nof revenue run higher than those of most dominant papers of our\nsize. There is adequate room, however, for our paper or any\nother dominant paper to sustain these costs: the difference\nbetween high and low news costs at papers of comparable size\nruns perhaps three percentage points while pre-tax profit margins\nare often ten times that amount.\n\nThe economics of a dominant newspaper are excellent, among\nthe very best in the business world. Owners, naturally, would\nlike to believe that their wonderful profitability is achieved\nonly because they unfailingly turn out a wonderful product. That\ncomfortable theory wilts before an uncomfortable fact. While\nfirst-class newspapers make excellent profits, the profits of\nthird-rate papers are as good or better - as long as either class\nof paper is dominant within its community. Of course, product\nquality may have been crucial to the paper in achieving\ndominance. We believe this was the case at the News, in very\nlarge part because of people such as Alfred Kirchhofer who\npreceded us.\n\nOnce dominant, the newspaper itself, not the marketplace,\ndetermines just how good or how bad the paper will be. Good or\nbad, it will prosper. That is not true of most businesses:\ninferior quality generally produces inferior economics. But even\na poor newspaper is a bargain to most citizens simply because of\nits bulletin board value. Other things being equal, a poor\nproduct will not achieve quite the level of readership achieved\nby a first-class product. A poor product, however, will still\nremain essential to most citizens, and what commands their\nattention will command the attention of advertisers.\n\nSince high standards are not imposed by the marketplace,\nmanagement must impose its own. Our commitment to an aboveaverage expenditure for news represents an important quantitative\nstandard. We have confidence that Stan Lipsey and Murray Light\nwill continue to apply the far-more important qualitative\nstandards. Charlie and I believe that newspapers are very\nspecial institutions in society. We are proud of the News, and\nintend an even greater pride to be justified in the years ahead.",
