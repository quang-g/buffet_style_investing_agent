    "chunk_text": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1984 was $152.6 million, or\n$133 per share. This sounds pretty good but actually its\nmediocre. Economic gains must be evaluated by comparison with\nthe capital that produces them. Our twenty-year compounded\nannual gain in book value has been 22.1% (from $19.46 in 1964 to\n$1108.77 in 1984), but our gain in 1984 was only 13.6%.\n\nAs we discussed last year, the gain in per-share intrinsic\nbusiness value is the economic measurement that really counts.\nBut calculations of intrinsic business value are subjective. In\nour case, book value serves as a useful, although somewhat\nunderstated, proxy. In my judgment, intrinsic business value and\nbook value increased during 1984 at about the same rate.\n\nUsing my academic voice, I have told you in the past of the\ndrag that a mushrooming capital base exerts upon rates of return.\nUnfortunately, my academic voice is now giving way to a\nreportorial voice. Our historical 22% rate is just that -\nhistory. To earn even 15% annually over the next decade\n(assuming we continue to follow our present dividend policy,\nabout which more will be said later in this letter) we would need\nprofits aggregating about $3.9 billion. Accomplishing this will\nrequire a few big ideas - small ones just wont do. Charlie\nMunger, my partner in general management, and I do not have any\nsuch ideas at present, but our experience has been that they pop\nup occasionally. (Hows that for a strategic plan?)",
