    "chunk_text": "The Blumkin blood did not run thin. Louie, Mrs. Bs son,\nand his three boys, Ron, Irv, and Steve, all contribute in full\nmeasure to NFMs amazing success. The younger generation has\nattended the best business school of them all - that conducted by\nMrs. B and Louie - and their training is evident in their\nperformance.\n\nLast year NFMs net sales increased by $14.3 million,\nbringing the total to $115 million, all from the one store in\nOmaha. That is by far the largest volume produced by a single\nhome furnishings store in the United States. In fact, the gain\nin sales last year was itself greater than the annual volume of\nmany good-sized successful stores. The business achieves this\nsuccess because it deserves this success. A few figures will\ntell you why.\n\nIn its fiscal 1984 10-K, the largest independent specialty\nretailer of home furnishings in the country, Levitz Furniture,\ndescribed its prices as generally lower than the prices charged\nby conventional furniture stores in its trading area. Levitz,\nin that year, operated at a gross margin of 44.4% (that is, on\naverage, customers paid it $100 for merchandise that had cost it\n$55.60 to buy). The gross margin at NFM is not much more than\nhalf of that. NFMs low mark-ups are possible because of its\nexceptional efficiency: operating expenses (payroll, occupancy,\nadvertising, etc.) are about 16.5% of sales versus 35.6% at\nLevitz.\n\nNone of this is in criticism of Levitz, which has a wellmanaged operation. But the NFM operation is simply extraordinary\n(and, remember, it all comes from a $500 investment by Mrs. B in\n1937). By unparalleled efficiency and astute volume purchasing,\nNFM is able to earn excellent returns on capital while saving its\ncustomers at least $30 million annually from what, on average, it\nwould cost them to buy the same merchandise at stores maintaining\ntypical mark-ups. Such savings enable NFM to constantly widen\nits geographical reach and thus to enjoy growth well beyond the\nnatural growth of the Omaha market.",

    "chunk_text": "This performance has not been produced by a generally rising\ntide. To the contrary, many well-known participants in the\nboxed-chocolate industry either have lost money in this same\nperiod or have been marginally profitable. To our knowledge,\nonly one good-sized competitor has achieved high profitability.\nThe success of Sees reflects the combination of an exceptional\nproduct and an exceptional manager, Chuck Huggins.\n\nDuring 1984 we increased prices considerably less than has\nbeen our practice in recent years: per-pound realization was\n$5.49, up only 1.4% from 1983. Fortunately, we made good\nprogress on cost control, an area that has caused us problems in\nrecent years. Per-pound costs - other than those for raw\nmaterials, a segment of expense largely outside of our control -\nincreased by only 2.2% last year.\n\nOur cost-control problem has been exacerbated by the problem\nof modestly declining volume (measured by pounds, not dollars) on\na same-store basis. Total pounds sold through shops in recent\nyears has been maintained at a roughly constant level only by the\nnet addition of a few shops annually. This more-shops-to-getthe-same-volume situation naturally puts heavy pressure on perpound selling costs.\n\nIn 1984, same-store volume declined 1.1%. Total shop volume,\nhowever, grew 0.6% because of an increase in stores. (Both\npercentages are adjusted to compensate for a 53-week fiscal year\nin 1983.)\n\nSees business tends to get a bit more seasonal each year.\nIn the four weeks prior to Christmas, we do 40% of the years\nvolume and earn about 75% of the years profits. We also earn\nsignificant sums in the Easter and Valentines Day periods, but\npretty much tread water the rest of the year. In recent years,\nshop volume at Christmas has grown in relative importance, and so\nhave quantity orders and mail orders. The increased\nconcentration of business in the Christmas period produces a\nmultitude of managerial problems, all of which have been handled\nby Chuck and his associates with exceptional skill and grace.\n\nTheir solutions have in no way involved compromises in\neither quality of service or quality of product. Most of our\nlarger competitors could not say the same. Though faced with\nsomewhat less extreme peaks and valleys in demand than we, they\nadd preservatives or freeze the finished product in order to\nsmooth the production cycle and thereby lower unit costs. We\nreject such techniques, opting, in effect, for production\nheadaches rather than product modification.\n\nOur mall stores face a host of new food and snack vendors\nthat provide particularly strong competition at non-holiday\nperiods. We need new products to fight back and during 1984 we\nintroduced six candy bars that, overall, met with a good\nreception. Further product introductions are planned.\n\nIn 1985 we will intensify our efforts to keep per-pound cost\nincreases below the rate of inflation. Continued success in\nthese efforts, however, will require gains in same-store\npoundage. Prices in 1985 should average 6% - 7% above those of\n1984. Assuming no change in same-store volume, profits should\nshow a moderate gain.",

    "chunk_text": "Buffalo Evening News\n\nProfits at the News in 1984 were considerably greater than\nwe expected. As at Sees, excellent progress was made in\ncontrolling costs. Excluding hours worked in the newsroom, total\nhours worked decreased by about 2.8%. With this productivity\nimprovement, overall costs increased only 4.9%. This performance\nby Stan Lipsey and his management team was one of the best in the\nindustry.\n\nHowever, we now face an acceleration in costs. In mid-1984\nwe entered into new multi-year union contracts that provided for\na large catch-up wage increase. This catch-up is entirely\nappropriate: the cooperative spirit of our unions during the\nunprofitable 1977-1982 period was an important factor in our\nsuccess in remaining cost competitive with The Courier-Express.\nHad we not kept costs down, the outcome of that struggle might\nwell have been different.\n\nBecause our new union contracts took effect at varying\ndates, little of the catch-up increase was reflected in our 1984\ncosts. But the increase will be almost totally effective in 1985\nand, therefore, our unit labor costs will rise this year at a\nrate considerably greater than that of the industry. We expect\nto mitigate this increase by continued small gains in\nproductivity, but we cannot avoid significantly higher wage costs\nthis year. Newsprint price trends also are less favorable now\nthan they were in 1984. Primarily because of these two factors,\nwe expect at least a minor contraction in margins at the News.\n\nWorking in our favor at the News are two factors of major\neconomic importance:\n\n(1) Our circulation is concentrated to an unusual degree\nin the area of maximum utility to our advertisers.\nRegional newspapers with wide-ranging circulation, on\nthe other hand, have a significant portion of their\ncirculation in areas that are of negligible utility to\nmost advertisers. A subscriber several hundred miles\naway is not much of a prospect for the puppy you are\noffering to sell via a classified ad - nor for the\ngrocer with stores only in the metropolitan area.\nWasted circulation - as the advertisers call it -\nhurts profitability: expenses of a newspaper are\ndetermined largely by gross circulation while\nadvertising revenues (usually 70% - 80% of total\nrevenues) are responsive only to useful circulation;\n\n(2) Our penetration of the Buffalo retail market is\nexceptional; advertisers can reach almost all of their\npotential customers using only the News.\n\nLast year I told you about this unusual reader acceptance:\namong the 100 largest newspapers in the country, we were then\nnumber one, daily, and number three, Sunday, in penetration. The\nmost recent figures show us number one in penetration on weekdays\nand number two on Sunday. (Even so, the number of households in\nBuffalo has declined, so our current weekday circulation is down\nslightly; on Sundays it is unchanged.)\n\nI told you also that one of the major reasons for this\nunusual acceptance by readers was the unusual quantity of news\nthat we delivered to them: a greater percentage of our paper is\ndevoted to news than is the case at any other dominant paper in\nour size range. In 1984 our news hole ratio was 50.9%, (versus\n50.4% in 1983), a level far above the typical 35% - 40%. We will\ncontinue to maintain this ratio in the 50% area. Also, though we\nlast year reduced total hours worked in other departments, we\nmaintained the level of employment in the newsroom and, again,\nwill continue to do so. Newsroom costs advanced 9.1% in 1984, a\nrise far exceeding our overall cost increase of 4.9%.",
