    "chunk_text": "To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nOur gain in net worth during 1984 was $152.6 million, or\n$133 per share. This sounds pretty good but actually its\nmediocre. Economic gains must be evaluated by comparison with\nthe capital that produces them. Our twenty-year compounded\nannual gain in book value has been 22.1% (from $19.46 in 1964 to\n$1108.77 in 1984), but our gain in 1984 was only 13.6%.\n\nAs we discussed last year, the gain in per-share intrinsic\nbusiness value is the economic measurement that really counts.\nBut calculations of intrinsic business value are subjective. In\nour case, book value serves as a useful, although somewhat\nunderstated, proxy. In my judgment, intrinsic business value and\nbook value increased during 1984 at about the same rate.\n\nUsing my academic voice, I have told you in the past of the\ndrag that a mushrooming capital base exerts upon rates of return.\nUnfortunately, my academic voice is now giving way to a\nreportorial voice. Our historical 22% rate is just that -\nhistory. To earn even 15% annually over the next decade\n(assuming we continue to follow our present dividend policy,\nabout which more will be said later in this letter) we would need\nprofits aggregating about $3.9 billion. Accomplishing this will\nrequire a few big ideas - small ones just wont do. Charlie\nMunger, my partner in general management, and I do not have any\nsuch ideas at present, but our experience has been that they pop\nup occasionally. (Hows that for a strategic plan?)",

    "chunk_text": "Sharp-eyed shareholders will notice that the amount of the\nspecial GEICO distribution and its location in the table have\nbeen changed from the presentation of last year. Though they\nreclassify and reduce accounting earnings, the changes are\nentirely of form, not of substance. The story behind the\nchanges, however, is interesting.\n\nAs reported last year: (1) in mid-1983 GEICO made a tender\noffer to buy its own shares; (2) at the same time, we agreed by\nwritten contract to sell GEICO an amount of its shares that would\nbe proportionately related to the aggregate number of shares\nGEICO repurchased via the tender from all other shareholders; (3)\nat completion of the tender, we delivered 350,000 shares to\nGEICO, received $21 million cash, and were left owning exactly\nthe same percentage of GEICO that we owned before the tender; (4)\nGEICOs transaction with us amounted to a proportionate\nredemption, an opinion rendered us, without qualification, by a\nleading law firm; (5) the Tax Code logically regards such\nproportionate redemptions as substantially equivalent to\ndividends and, therefore, the $21 million we received was taxed\nat only the 6.9% inter-corporate dividend rate; (6) importantly,\nthat $21 million was far less than the previously-undistributed\nearnings that had inured to our ownership in GEICO and, thus,\nfrom the standpoint of economic substance, was in our view\nequivalent to a dividend.\n\nBecause it was material and unusual, we highlighted the\nGEICO distribution last year to you, both in the applicable\nquarterly report and in this section of the annual report.\nAdditionally, we emphasized the transaction to our auditors,\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. Both the Omaha office of Peat\nMarwick and the reviewing Chicago partner, without objection,\nconcurred with our dividend presentation.\n\nIn 1984, we had a virtually identical transaction with\nGeneral Foods. The only difference was that General Foods\nrepurchased its stock over a period of time in the open market,\nwhereas GEICO had made a one-shot tender offer. In the General\nFoods case we sold to the company, on each day that it\nrepurchased shares, a quantity of shares that left our ownership\npercentage precisely unchanged. Again our transaction was\npursuant to a written contract executed before repurchases began.\nAnd again the money we received was far less than the retained\nearnings that had inured to our ownership interest since our\npurchase. Overall we received $21,843,601 in cash from General\nFoods, and our ownership remained at exactly 8.75%.\n\nAt this point the New York office of Peat Marwick came into\nthe picture. Late in 1984 it indicated that it disagreed with\nthe conclusions of the firms Omaha office and Chicago reviewing\npartner. The New York view was that the GEICO and General Foods\ntransactions should be treated as sales of stock by Berkshire\nrather than as the receipt of dividends. Under this accounting\napproach, a portion of the cost of our investment in the stock of\neach company would be charged against the redemption payment and\nany gain would be shown as a capital gain, not as dividend\nincome. This is an accounting approach only, having no bearing\non taxes: Peat Marwick agrees that the transactions were\ndividends for IRS purposes.\n\nWe disagree with the New York position from both the\nviewpoint of economic substance and proper accounting. But, to\navoid a qualified auditors opinion, we have adopted herein Peat\nMarwicks 1984 view and restated 1983 accordingly. None of this,\nhowever, has any effect on intrinsic business value: our\nownership interests in GEICO and General Foods, our cash, our\ntaxes, and the market value and tax basis of our holdings all\nremain the same.\n\nThis year we have again entered into a contract with General\nFoods whereby we will sell them shares concurrently with open\nmarket purchases that they make. The arrangement provides that\nour ownership interest will remain unchanged at all times. By\nkeeping it so, we will insure ourselves dividend treatment for\ntax purposes. In our view also, the economic substance of this\ntransaction again is the creation of dividend income. However,\nwe will account for the redemptions as sales of stock rather than\ndividend income unless accounting rules are adopted that speak\ndirectly to this point. We will continue to prominently identify\nany such special transactions in our reports to you.",

    "chunk_text": "While we enjoy a low tax charge on these proportionate\nredemptions, and have participated in several of them, we view\nsuch repurchases as at least equally favorable for shareholders\nwho do not sell. When companies with outstanding businesses and\ncomfortable financial positions find their shares selling far\nbelow intrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action\ncan benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases.\n\n(Our endorsement of repurchases is limited to those dictated\nby price/value relationships and does not extend to the\ngreenmail repurchase - a practice we find odious and repugnant.\nIn these transactions, two parties achieve their personal ends by\nexploitation of an innocent and unconsulted third party. The\nplayers are: (1) the shareholder extortionist who, even before\nthe ink on his stock certificate dries, delivers his yourmoney-or-your-life message to managers; (2) the corporate\ninsiders who quickly seek peace at any price - as long as the\nprice is paid by someone else; and (3) the shareholders whose\nmoney is used by (2) to make (1) go away. As the dust settles,\nthe mugging, transient shareholder gives his speech on free\nenterprise, the muggee management gives its speech on the best\ninterests of the company, and the innocent shareholder standing\nby mutely funds the payoff.)\n\nThe companies in which we have our largest investments have\nall engaged in significant stock repurhases at times when wide\ndiscrepancies existed between price and value. As shareholders,\nwe find this encouraging and rewarding for two important reasons\n- one that is obvious, and one that is subtle and not always\nunderstood. The obvious point involves basic arithmetic: major\nrepurchases at prices well below per-share intrinsic business\nvalue immediately increase, in a highly significant way, that\nvalue. When companies purchase their own stock, they often find\nit easy to get $2 of present value for $1. Corporate acquisition\nprograms almost never do as well and, in a discouragingly large\nnumber of cases, fail to get anything close to $1 of value for\neach $1 expended.\n\nThe other benefit of repurchases is less subject to precise\nmeasurement but can be fully as important over time. By making\nrepurchases when a companys market value is well below its\nbusiness value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given\nto actions that enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than\nto actions that expand managements domain but that do nothing\nfor (or even harm) shareholders. Seeing this, shareholders and\npotential shareholders increase their estimates of future returns\nfrom the business. This upward revision, in turn, produces\nmarket prices more in line with intrinsic business value. These\nprices are entirely rational. Investors should pay more for a\nbusiness that is lodged in the hands of a manager with\ndemonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands\nof a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer. (To\nmake the point extreme, how much would you pay to be a minority\nshareholder of a company controlled by Robert Wesco?)\n\nThe key word is demonstrated. A manager who consistently\nturns his back on repurchases, when these clearly are in the\ninterests of owners, reveals more than he knows of his\nmotivations. No matter how often or how eloquently he mouths\nsome public relations-inspired phrase such as maximizing\nshareholder wealth (this seasons favorite), the market\ncorrectly discounts assets lodged with him. His heart is not\nlistening to his mouth - and, after a while, neither will the\nmarket.\n\nWe have prospered in a very major way - as have other\nshareholders - by the large share repurchases of GEICO,\nWashington Post, and General Foods, our three largest holdings.\n(Exxon, in which we have our fourth largest holding, has also\nwisely and aggressively repurchased shares but, in this case, we\nhave only recently established our position.) In each of these\ncompanies, shareholders have had their interests in outstanding\nbusinesses materially enhanced by repurchases made at bargain\nprices. We feel very comfortable owning interests in businesses\nsuch as these that offer excellent economics combined with\nshareholder-conscious managements.",
