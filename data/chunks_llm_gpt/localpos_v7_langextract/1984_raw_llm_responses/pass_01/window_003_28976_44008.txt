The\ncombined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses incurred\nplus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums; a ratio below\n100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above 100 indicates\na loss.\n\nFor a number of years, we have told you that an annual\nincrease by the industry of about 10% per year in premiums\nwritten is necessary for the combined ratio to remain roughly\nunchanged. We assumed in making that assertion that expenses as\na percentage of premium volume would stay relatively stable and\nthat losses would grow at about 10% annually because of the\ncombined influence of unit volume increases, inflation, and\njudicial rulings that expand what is covered by the insurance\npolicy.",

    "chunk_text": "Our opinion is proving dismayingly accurate: a premium\nincrease of 10% per year since 1979 would have produced an\naggregate increase through 1984 of 61% and a combined ratio in\n1984 almost identical to the 100.6 of 1979. Instead, the\nindustry had only a 30% increase in premiums and a 1984 combined\nratio of 117.7. Today, we continue to believe that the key index\nto the trend of underwriting profitability is the year-to-year\npercentage change in industry premium volume.\n\nIt now appears that premium volume in 1985 will grow well\nover 10%. Therefore, assuming that catastrophes are at a\nnormal level, we would expect the combined ratio to begin\neasing downward toward the end of the year. However, under our\nindustrywide loss assumptions (i. e., increases of 10% annually),\nfive years of 15%-per-year increases in premiums would be\nrequired to get the combined ratio back to 100. This would mean\na doubling of industry volume by 1989, an outcome that seems\nhighly unlikely to us. Instead, we expect several years of\npremium gains somewhat above the 10% level, followed by highlycompetitive pricing that generally will produce combined ratios\nin the 108-113 range.\n\nOur own combined ratio in 1984 was a humbling 134. (Here, as\nthroughout this report, we exclude structured settlements and the\nassumption of loss reserves in reporting this ratio. Much\nadditional detail, including the effect of discontinued\noperations on the ratio, appears on pages 42-43). This is the\nthird year in a row that our underwriting performance has been\nfar poorer than that of the industry. We expect an improvement\nin the combined ratio in 1985, and also expect our improvement to\nbe substantially greater than that of the industry. Mike\nGoldberg has corrected many of the mistakes I made before he took\nover insurance operations. Moreover, our business is\nconcentrated in lines that have experienced poorer-than-average\nresults during the past several years, and that circumstance has\nbegun to subdue many of our competitors and even eliminate some.\nWith the competition shaken, we were able during the last half of\n1984 to raise prices significantly in certain important lines\nwith little loss of business.\n\nFor some years I have told you that there could be a day\ncoming when our premier financial strength would make a real\ndifference in the competitive position of our insurance\noperation. That day may have arrived. We are almost without\nquestion the strongest property/casualty insurance operation in\nthe country, with a capital position far superior to that of\nwell-known companies of much greater size.",

    "chunk_text": "Equally important, our corporate policy is to retain that\nsuperiority. The buyer of insurance receives only a promise in\nexchange for his cash. The value of that promise should be\nappraised against the possibility of adversity, not prosperity.\nAt a minimum, the promise should appear able to withstand a\nprolonged combination of depressed financial markets and\nexceptionally unfavorable underwriting results. Our insurance\nsubsidiaries are both willing and able to keep their promises in\nany such environment - and not too many other companies clearly\nare.\n\nOur financial strength is a particular asset in the business\nof structured settlements and loss reserve assumptions that we\nreported on last year. The claimant in a structured settlement\nand the insurance company that has reinsured loss reserves need\nto be completely confident that payments will be forthcoming for\ndecades to come. Very few companies in the property/casualty\nfield can meet this test of unquestioned long-term strength. (In\nfact, only a handful of companies exists with which we will\nreinsure our own liabilities.)\n\nWe have grown in these new lines of business: funds that we\nhold to offset assumed liabilities grew from $16.2 million to\n$30.6 million during the year. We expect growth to continue and\nperhaps to greatly accelerate. To support this projected growth\nwe have added substantially to the capital of Columbia Insurance\nCompany, our reinsurance unit specializing in structured\nsettlements and loss reserve assumptions. While these businesses\nare very competitive, returns should be satisfactory.",
