    "chunk_text": "Finance and Financial Products\nThis, our smallest sector, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), and\nClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes.\nBoth of our leasing businesses improved their performances last year, albeit from a very low base.\nXTRA increased the utilization of its equipment from 63% in 2009 to 75% in 2010, thereby raising pre-tax\nearnings to $35 million from $17 million in 2009. CORT experienced a pickup in business as the year progressed\nand also significantly tightened its operations. The combination increased its pre-tax results from a loss of\n$3 million in 2009 to $18 million of profit in 2010.\nAt Clayton, we produced 23,343 homes, 47% of the industry’s total of 50,046. Contrast this to the peak\nyear of 1998, when 372,843 homes were manufactured. (We then had an industry share of 8%.) Sales would have\nbeen terrible last year under any circumstances, but the financing problems I commented upon in the 2009 report\ncontinue to exacerbate the distress. To explain: Home-financing policies of our government, expressed through\nthe loans found acceptable by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, favor site-built homes and work to negate the\nprice advantage that manufactured homes offer.\nWe finance more manufactured-home buyers than any other company. Our experience, therefore,\nshould be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country’s home-loan practices. Let’s take a look.\nClayton owns 200,804 mortgages that it originated. (It also has some mortgage portfolios that it\npurchased.) At the origination of these contracts, the average FICO score of our borrowers was 648, and 47%\nwere 640 or below. Your banker will tell you that people with such scores are generally regarded as questionable\ncredits.\nNevertheless, our portfolio has performed well during conditions of stress. Here’s our loss experience\nduring the last five years for originated loans:\nNet Losses as a Percentage\nYear of Average Loans\n2006 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.53%\n2007 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.27%\n2008 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.17%\n2009 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.86%\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.72%\nOur borrowers get in trouble when they lose their jobs, have health problems, get divorced, etc. The\nrecession has hit them hard. But they want to stay in their homes, and generally they borrowed sensible amounts\nin relation to their income. In addition, we were keeping the originated mortgages for our own account, which\nmeans we were not securitizing or otherwise reselling them. If we were stupid in our lending, we were going to\npay the price. That concentrates the mind.\nIf home buyers throughout the country had behaved like our buyers, America would not have had the\ncrisis that it did. Our approach was simply to get a meaningful down-payment and gear fixed monthly payments\nto a sensible percentage of income. This policy kept Clayton solvent and also kept buyers in their homes.\nHome ownership makes sense for most Americans, particularly at today’s lower prices and bargain\ninterest rates. All things considered, the third best investment I ever made was the purchase of my home, though I\nwould have made far more money had I instead rented and used the purchase money to buy stocks. (The two best\ninvestments were wedding rings.) For the $31,500 I paid for our house, my family and I gained 52 years of\nterrific memories with more to come.",

    "chunk_text": "* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn our earlier estimate of Berkshire’s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to\nfuture investment income (but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just\ndescribed).\nThe first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income\ninvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these – our Swiss Re\nnote – was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others – our Goldman Sachs and General Electric\npreferred stocks – are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in October\nand has stated its intention to do so. Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but has\nbeen held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light\nbefore long.\nAll three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so – in aggregate about $1.4 billion –\nbut all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly\nreduced. That’s the bad news.\nThere are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least\n$500 million – and perhaps much more – to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yields\nis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of\n“normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an\nopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To update\nAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\nIn addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen\ndividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though\nconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength\nand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don’t fault the Fed: For\nvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just\nthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In\n2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I\nwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share of\nCoke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\nOverall, I believe our “normal” investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.",

Todd, as was the case with\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by\nundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have\nreceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their\nlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly started\nanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past\nlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\nAs long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire’s holdings, both bonds\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can reset\nannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like to\nrequire style boxes such as “long-short,” “macro,” “international equities.” At Berkshire our only style box is\n“smart.”)\nOver time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager’s performance compensation be dependent on his or her own\nportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big for\nindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\nWhen Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a useful\nperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted – but not to have a vote – on the\nwisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\nOne footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a number of commentators\npointed out that he was “little-known” and expressed puzzlement that we didn’t seek a “big-name.” I wonder\nhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959. Our goal\nwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops – that may not be the smartest\nmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)",
