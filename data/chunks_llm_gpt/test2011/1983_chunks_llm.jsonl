Most of this growth resulted from our\nmerger with Blue Chip Stamps, but there also was an acceleration\nin the pace of natural increase that has raised us from the\n1000 level a few years ago.\n\nWith so many new shareholders, its appropriate to summarize\nthe major business principles we follow that pertain to the\nmanager-owner relationship:\n\no\nAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is\npartnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as\nowner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because\nof the size of our shareholdings we also are, for better or\nworse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself\nas the ultimate owner of our business assets but, instead, view\nthe company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the\nassets.\n\no\nIn line with this owner-orientation, our directors are all\nmajor shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. In the case of at\nleast four of the five, over 50% of family net worth is\nrepresented by holdings of Berkshire. We eat our own cooking.\n\no\nOur long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications\nmentioned later) is to maximize the average annual rate of gain\nin intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not\nmeasure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by\nits size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that\nthe rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a\ngreatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be\ndisappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average\nlarge American corporation.\n\no\nOur preference would be to reach this goal by directly\nowning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and\nconsistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second\nchoice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily\nthrough purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance\nsubsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the\nneed for insurance capital determine any given years capital\nallocation.\n\no\nBecause of this two-pronged approach to business ownership\nand because of the limitations of conventional accounting,\nconsolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about\nour true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and\nmanagers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However,\nwe will also report to you the earnings of each major business we\ncontrol, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures,\nalong with other information we will supply about the individual\nbusinesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about\nthem.\n\no\nAccounting consequences do not influence our operating or\ncapital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are\nsimilar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not\nreportable by us under standard accounting principles than to\npurchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely\nthe choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose\nearnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the\npro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely\nunreportable). In aggregate and over time, we expect the\nunreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic\nbusiness value thr", "char_count": 3343, "word_count": 529, "position_in_letter": 0.0, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}

Intrinsic business value is an economic\nconcept, estimating future cash output discounted to present\nvalue. Book value tells you what has been put in; intrinsic\nbusiness value estimates what can be taken out.\n\nAn analogy will suggest the difference. Assume you spend\nidentical amounts putting each of two children through college.\nThe book value (measured by financial input) of each childs\neducation would be the same. But the present value of the future\npayoff (the intrinsic business value) might vary enormously -\nfrom zero to many times the cost of the education. So, also, do\nbusinesses having equal financial input end up with wide\nvariations in value.\n\nAt Berkshire, at the beginning of fiscal 1965 when the\npresent management took over, the $19.46 per share book value\nconsiderably overstated intrinsic business value. All of that\nbook value consisted of textile assets that could not earn, on\naverage, anything close to an appropriate rate of return. In the\nterms of our analogy, the investment in textile assets resembled\ninvestment in a largely-wasted education.\n\nNow, however, our intrinsic business value considerably\nexceeds book value. There are two major reasons:\n\n(1) Standard accounting principles require that common\nstocks held by our insurance subsidiaries be stated on\nour books at market value, but that other stocks we own\nbe carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nAt the end of 1983, the market value of this latter\ngroup exceeded carrying value by $70 million pre-tax,\nor about $50 million after tax. This excess belongs in\nour intrinsic business value, but is not included in\nthe calculation of book value;\n\n(2) More important, we own several businesses that possess\neconomic Goodwill (which is properly includable in\nintrinsic business value) far larger than the\naccounting Goodwill that is carried on our balance\nsheet and reflected in book value.\n\nGoodwill, both economic and accounting, is an arcane subject\nand requires more explanation than is appropriate here. The\nappendix that follows this letter - Goodwill and its\nAmortization: The Rules and The Realities - explains why\neconomic and accounting Goodwill can, and usually do, differ\nenormously.\n\nYou can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking\nabout Goodwill and its amortization. But students of investment\nand management should understand the nuances of the subject. My\nown thinking has changed drastically from 35 years ago when I was\ntaught to favor tangible assets and to shun businesses whose\nvalue depended largely upon economic Goodwill. This bias caused\nme to make many important business mistakes of omission, although\nrelatively few of commission.\n\nKeynes identified my problem: The difficulty lies not in\nthe new ideas but in escaping from the old ones. My escape was\nlong delayed, in part because most of what I had been taught by\nthe same teacher had been (and continues to be) so\nextraordinarily valuable.
