I'll make it brief.\n\nThe restatement was required because GEICO became a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Berkshire on January 2,1996, whereas it was previously\nclassified as an investment.

We are\nhere to make money with you, not off you.\n\nThe Relationship of Intrinsic Value to Market Price\n\nIn last year's letter, with Berkshire shares selling at $36,000, I\ntold you: (1) Berkshire's gain in market value in recent years had\noutstripped its gain in intrinsic value, even though the latter gain had\nbeen highly satisfactory; (2) that kind of overperformance could not\ncontinue indefinitely; (3) Charlie and I did not at that moment consider\nBerkshire to be undervalued.\n\nSince I set down those cautions, Berkshire's intrinsic value has\nincreased very significantly - aided in a major way by a stunning\nperformance at GEICO that I will tell you more about later - while the\nmarket price of our shares has changed little. This, of course, means\nthat in 1996 Berkshire's stock underperformed the business.\nConsequently, today's price/value relationship is both much different\nfrom what it was a year ago and, as Charlie and I see it, more\nappropriate.\n\nOver time, the aggregate gains made by Berkshire shareholders must\nof necessity match the business gains of the company. When the stock\ntemporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number\nof shareholders - either sellers or buyers - receive outsized benefits at\nthe expense of those they trade with. Generally, the sophisticated have\nan edge over the innocents in this game.\n\nThough our primary goal is to maximize the amount that our\nshareholders, in total, reap from their ownership of Berkshire, we wish\nalso to minimize the benefits going to some shareholders at the expense\nof others. These are goals we would have were we managing a family\npartnership, and we believe they make equal sense for the manager of a\npublic company. In a partnership, fairness requires that partnership\ninterests be valued equitably when partners enter or exit; in a public\ncompany, fairness prevails when market price and intrinsic value are in\nsync. Obviously, they won't always meet that ideal, but a manager - by\nhis policies and communications - can do much to foster equity.\n\nOf course, the longer", "char_count": 2370, "word_count": 395, "position_in_letter": 0.0882195937403422, "position_in_section": 0, "total_chunks_in_section": 1}
