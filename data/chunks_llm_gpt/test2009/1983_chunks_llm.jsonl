Most of this growth resulted from our\nmerger with Blue Chip Stamps, but there also was an acceleration\nin the pace of natural increase that has raised us from the\n1000 level a few years ago.\n\nWith so many new shareholders, its appropriate to summarize\nthe major business principles we follow that pertain to the\nmanager-owner relationship:\n\no\nAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is\npartnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as\nowner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because\nof the size of our shareholdings we also are, for better or\nworse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself\nas the ultimate owner of our business assets but, instead, view\nthe company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the\nassets.\n\no\nIn line with this owner-orientation, our directors are all\nmajor shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. In the case of at\nleast four of the five, over 50% of family net worth is\nrepresented by holdings of Berkshire. We eat our own cooking.\n\no\nOur long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications\nmentioned later) is to maximize the average annual rate of gain\nin intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not\nmeasure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by\nits size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that\nthe rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a\ngreatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be\ndisappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average\nlarge American corporation.\n\no\nOur preference would be to reach this goal by directly\nowning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and\nconsistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second\nchoice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily\nthrough purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance\nsubsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the\nneed for insurance capital determine any given years capital\nallocation.\n\no\nBecause of this two-pronged approach to business ownership\nand because of the limitations of conventional accounting,\nconsolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about\nour true economic performance.
